It’s a strange day. I voted Democrat as a conservative. 
I voted for Trump in 2016 and 3rd party in 2020. Grew up in a Republican household listening to Rush Limbaugh because my parents did, and became an independent in college after becoming disillusioned by the GOP, but would often vote “socially conservative”. I still have what most of Reddit would call very conservative values, but what my Republican friends would call liberal values. I have no real political home. My ballots usually look like a weird mix of voting Republican, 3rd party, and Democrat down ballot. 🤷‍♂️

 Anyway.

At the start of the year I would have told you that I would vote 3rd party, but I got into that little ballot cubicle yesterday and I just couldn’t do it. Trump has given American voters a non-stop litany of reasons not to vote for him, even if you are a conservative. It’s like if he said to himself “what could I do to turn voters against me” and by golly he did it. And not just reasons not to vote for him, but it’s like he’s screaming at us to vote against him and make sure he loses. 

So I think Harris will carry Michigan because I know so many people in a similar situation. If someone like John McCain was running against Harris I could and probably would vote for him. Trump isn’t a “conservative”. It’s baffling to hear people think he is. Too much is at stake. Every 4 years it’s “this is the most important election of our lifetime” but now it actually feels like it. It’s different than any other election in my lifetime. 

One day I hope we will have two or more viable sane political parties to choose from again instead of feeling like “I have to vote against the other party”. But for now, this conservative stands firmly with the rest of you - and I voted Democrat in the presidential election for the first time. 

 Last thing I would say to my Democrat friends, please don’t fight and argue political issues with your conservative friends who are also voting for Harris and accidentally push them back into voting for Trump. At least not right now. I have witnessed that happen a couple of times in the heat of an argument. I feel like right now all social issues get set aside and we vote together as Americans to make sure Trump doesn’t end up back in office. 

 With that said, assume nothing and go vote. Voting early was easy. I just showed up and voted like I normally would on Election Day. Exact same process. The line looked crazy long, wrapping around the building outside, but I had voted and was gone in under an hour. 
This has been a wild ride... I'm not a liberal person, and got yelled at for the first time today for being a liberal... crazy!!! A lady jumped down my throat, accused me of being non-Christian, and then told me to go cry in the woods. I'm a 6'2" man, I wear flannel, I build motorcycles, and I have a whole bunch of guns. I just don't want a man who thinks the military should be loyal to him, not the country they serve, or a man who thinks that my city is the reason we're "a developing nation". If he secures a win, these folks will only multiply.
I came from a Mark Scott family. My parents bought me an NRA membership for my tenth birthday. I learned to shoot a .22 when I was six. I was a member of the local Libertarian party when I was 16 and regularly attended monthly meetings all on my own. 

I’ve since swung to the other side of the pendulum, but most of my family are still staunchly conservative. 

I understand “conservative” values. I grew up with them. Nothing about Trump reflects the values that were beaten into me as a kid. I just don’t fucking understand how anyone who is actually a Christian or actually a conservative can vote for him.
Growing up in the 70s and 80s, I believed that the republicans were the fiscally responsible party, and democrats were the party of higher taxes that gave handouts to lazy people. I now believe that democrats are the pragmatic, sensible party that will preserve our system of government, and republicans are only interested in greed and power, using lies and hatred to create outrage about social issues (guns, abortion, lgbtq, immigration, etc.) in order to get votes from those who are uninformed or don’t think logically, and will ultimately vote against their best interests.
>One day I hope we will have two or more viable sane political parties to choose from

  
It is really infuriating that America has one sane, sensible party, and one party that's basically a monkey in a cage hurling feces at everyone.

I hate that we aren't debating *how to solve* real issues. We aren't debating about what we should do about income inequality. About climate change. About runaway corporate power. About healthcare reform. That sort of thing.

Instead we're arguing whether or not some people deserve basic human rights. Instead we're arguing about whether or not some of those issues above are *real* or if they're just some conspiracy. Instead we're afraid of helping the American people because one party has conditioned half the population to have a reflexive visceral reaction to "socialism".

I'd love to say I'm an independent voter who doesn't care about party, but only one party lives in reality anymore, so I more or less vote blue no matter who, and hope that enough other people do that, that the Republican party dies, and the Democrats can split into "moderate" and "leftist" and we can actually start moving this country forward.
It's appreciated. I know the Democratic party making room on its right flank for disaffected old-school Republicans isn't a popular choice for those of us on the far left, but by jove if it can win some elections maybe we'll pull this country out of its tailspin.  
  
This might be a hot take, but I'd rather squabble with *you* over tax reform than fight with *fucking neo-nazis* over basic human rights. There's at least one godless transgender socialist in Michigan who's glad to have you on our side this time around. 😉
Thank you! I will say this: I used to be like you, too. John McCain was the last republican I supported. He would have been a fine president, and I am sad he never got to hold office. He would have been far better than Bush Jr.
This is an important election because we expect the president to obey the constitution. You know, because you take an oath to do just that. 

And for most candidates, either party would do that. 

But one person has already proven they won’t.
Thank you for voting, and I really mean that.  

I didn’t vote for John McCain, but I didn’t hate him like I hate Trump.  McCain didn’t intentionally divide our nation with vitriol for personal gain.  As McCain said, ‘We’re just two Americans with different ideas on how to run the country.’  I didn’t agree with McCain’s ideas, but I still respected him and knew he would defend democracy in this nation.  
My message to conservatives is this:  You only need vote for her once, and he’s gone.  After that, reclaim your goddamn party.  

That’s it.  He’ll be sentenced in late November for NY crimes, he’ll be tried in Georgia, likely sentenced, tried in DC, and his classified documents case WILL get back in the docket.  He is going to spend the rest of his miserable pathetic life in prison.  

Thanks for doing the right thing for this country, and our future.  
Sincerely, 
Your Rabid Liberal Fellow Michigander
My mom will be voting for Harris this election as well. She is a lifelong conservative.

>If someone like John McCain was running against Harris I could and probably would vote for him.

McCain is a hero and as a liberal, I would've been proud to have had him as a president.
Thanks. I genuinely hope Republicans can shed Maga and restore normalcy in their party.
You voted for democracy and that’s not strange.
From Michigan, been in Kansas City for five years now. I voted democrat for the first time to bring Gretchen W into the governorship back in 2018, but still considered myself a republican—hawkish, pro big business, evangelical morals. I used to be tea party 9/11 truther before that. I am now a registered democrat because the only thing I disagree with them on is abortion and transgender treatment for minors. And I’m not far off of either of those positions anyway. The GOP has left reason, fact, and data for dogma and fundamentalist conservatism that’s flirting with fascism. They have no interest in real leadership or sound economic policy. I have left and do not plan to return anytime soon. I politically identify myself with Democrats for Life in America. Look into them; they’re cool. I’d bet you’d feel at home with their platform. 

Biden and Kamala are interested in preserving the republic, lifting up the middle class, and stopping fascism abroad (looking at you, Putin). Trump is not a good person and needs to be soundly defeated. I pray it is so next Wednesday morning.
I’m here too. I voted Republican all my life until Trump showed up. Gary Johnson in 2016, and made the full pull to Biden in 2020.

I just voted a straight Democratic ticket this election. Fuck the GOP and what it’s done. I want to send a message.
After trump's first term and MTG, Boebert, Gaetz, Turtle Mitch , and that tool, they voted in as speaker, I don't think I'll ever vote republican again. And, yes, before you roast me on a spit, I have voted republican before and regretted it both times.
Thank you.

It really isn’t policy differences this time.  It feels like a vote for or against our country.  I know that probably sounds like hyperbole, but not this time.
To address your example, Trump and McCain are miles apart. McCain was a decent man who a reasonable person might disagree with on policy. Trump is an embarrassment to the USA at this point. An argument could be made in 2016, even 2020, but after seeing him handle that loss, he isn't fit to hold the office occupied by men like Washington. 

Good on you for realizing that.
Same here fellow Michigander. You're doing what is required to bring the Republican party back to the conservatism of Reagan, including the sense of compassionate conservatism for immigrants; Reagan himself gave amnesty to immigrants. If Trump wins it'll reinforce to the entire party that his model is the right one and it'll be 10-20 years before it ever has a chance to get it back to it. You don't reward bad behavior with electing someone to the highest office in the executive branch.

I've been an Independent split ticket voter since 2008 and 22 was the first year I couldn't because our state's GOP just went absolutely off the rails after 2020. 2024 will be the second time in my life I'll be forced into a situation where I cannot split my ticket again cause the moderate got primaried out in my district with a pro-federal abortion ban candidate because he was one of the few that voted to impeach Trump for January 6th.
Thank you for putting country above party.

If Harris fails, we can try to replace her in 4 years.

If Trump wins, we’ll likely never get another chance to
Just want to say thank you. I have so much anxiety about the result. People I love and have respected my whole life typically vote republican. Really hoping they can see the light that you have.
Look, we can go back to arguing about the other shit next January. For now, it’s enough to preserve the ideals that we agree on and the Republic for which they stand.
Me too. Felt great.
Republicans are extremely concerned with trans people. It’s very strange. I think I’ve met like 2 trans people in my life (though met hundreds of gay people) and not to offend them, but i quite literally never think of them. They don’t affect my life in any way whatsoever. The only time I ever hear about them is from republicans. The idea that it’s basically a main campaign talking point for them is mind boggling to me.
Also a conservative here in Michigan who voted for Harris
Now get your family and friends to do the same
Thank-you for putting country before party.
Thank you for your story and your vote for sanity.
If this thread isn’t balm to my psyche, I just don’t know. It’s been a tough mental road putting my head around those that can support a man like Trump. It’s nice to hear something positive.
WOW! This right here could damn near spell out word for word my situation as well, except voting Harris will be the 2nd time I've voted for Dem as president, voted Biden in 2020.
>If someone like John McCain was running against Harris I could and probably would vote for him.   

I said it before as a Democrat, I wasn't actually afraid of John McCain becoming President, or Mitt Romney, or in 2016 during the Primaries, if John Kasich was was the GOP nominee.  

Trump however actually frightens me.  Not his stance on the issues, because he doesn't have any.  Not his policies, again he doesn't have any.  It is his insane rhetoric.  His rhetoric is right out of the Nazi playbook.  His obvious love of dictators, and disdain for the US constitution is what takes him from just a weird-o who paints his face orange, to an actual threat to democracy.  That and his inability, unwillingness, and disinterest in actually doing the job.  He refuses to yield to experts, be it about hurricane response, pandemic response, or military treaty.  Like a true fool he thinks he is the smartest person in the room.   Hint... he isn't... like ever.   Except when he passes Melania to the toilet, then just maybe.    

The January 6th attack on the capitol was his doing.  He met with the proud boys in the previous December around Christmas.  This was Roger Stone's hair brained scheme and Trump went along with it.  

No one who values the USA way of life should make light of the attack on the capitol and the disruption of the peaceful transfer of power.
I just cancelled my husband’s absentee Trump/all R vote for my Kamala/ all but a few were all D, at early voting today. Used to think conservatively. Now I just don’t recognize anything good about the GOP.
I grew up in a conservative household, but I consider myself progressive. I've lived in California (born and raised), Texas, Arizona, and now I live in Michigan. Each of those states has had both Republican and Democratic governors and legislatures while I lived there. 

Never have I ever felt existential dread if the other party won the election. I didn't agree with their policies. I was disgusted by the Bush-Cheney lies about Iraq, but even so, it was politics, not existential. 

Trump is different. He is a morally bankrupt, criminal, sociopathic, malignant narcissist who truly has no sense of responsibility to the country. No sense of duty or service. No ethics. 

As hyperbolic as it sounds, he really is America's Hitler. He is a fascist. He does aspire to be an autocrat. All the billionaires who are either openly supporting him or staying silent aren't weak. They are greedy. They will end up being the first American oligarchs.
My parents have a big group of friends they've known for decades. Everyone in the group, except my parents, has always been Republican. Some of them voted for Trump in 2016, some didn't vote in 2020, and every single one of them is voting for Harris this year. They're still conservative but they're doing the right thing for their country and I hope they live to see an ethical conservative party rise again. Our country is stronger when we have two political parties that are working to make this country better for everyone.

I think it takes intelligence to see through what Trump is trying to accomplish and I hope I will be as clear-eyed should this ever happen to the Democrats.
Thank you so much for this.  My parents both Republican.  Things changed for them when their granddaughter expecting her first baby had a high risk pregnancy, needed to be hospitalized and an emergency c section.  They listened to the stories of women losing their lives not able to receive care that luckily saved the life of my niece and her baby boy.  They have both voted for Harris
Thank you. Not just for voting but for being willing to share your story. I think it's extremely important to hear from people who are changing their established patterns and why. It tells a lot about where we are as a collective. And honestly, it calms my nerves a lot to hear from people who have conservative values and want nothing to do with Trump's hateful, divisive platform. I miss when I disagreed with conservatives instead of being terrified one of them drank enough kool-aid that they were going to hurt me.
Thank you for choosing country over party. I am an elected democratic precinct delegate who ran as a write in because there wasn’t a full slate. The stakes are too high this time around and I needed to step up and do something. I see polling numbers dead even, but every reddit board I go to is like this here. 

I see pro-Trump attack posts heavily downvoted and immediately swarmed on to call them out. I see people like you who realize that while Kamala doesn’t share all of your values, she has shown decency and intelligence when her opponent has shown malice and ignorance. 

I hope Reddit is a Bellwether of what’s to come. I’ve really started to see the best in people the last several days.
Thank you for helping save our great nation, freedoms and democracy.
Also voted early today. First time casting a ballot for a democratic president and first time voting for a Vice President!  Walz seems like a pretty normal guy. Kinda like me!

I even voted Dem instead of Rogers. That dude seems like a major douche. Normally I’d throw my vote to the libertarians, but didn’t want to throw my vote away!
The bar is simply “believes in democracy”. Trump is the same guy that ran in 2016, but I am glad some people learned from their mistakes, at least for one election. Hopefully it’s not too late.
Historically, and having been raised mostly in West Michigan, I have voted much like you. However, in 2016, I vowed never to vote republican (or 3rd party) again. There is just too much at stake. One thing that seems to be a major issue is the general public, aka those that didn't necessarily fully pay attention in government class, do not understand the electoral college. Many people think it's "fine" not to vote, but sadly, voting 3rd party or not voting at all risks a vote towards Trump and we can't, as a first world nation, afford that. Meanwhile, I've got our sponsor for Australian citizenship lined up for our family and I hope we NEVER have to do that because I love America and being American. Admittedly, since late 2015/early 2016, it has not felt the same and probably never will 😭
[deleted]
I just want to say that I appreciate your thoughtful and intelligent response to the current political situation. 

I just wrote a sentence that has maybe never existed on Reddit. Ha!
thank you.
Similar situation growing up, 24/7 Rush and Fox News.  Heck, in 2007 I went to a Tea Party rally… I eventually changed my opinion after getting into the renewable energy/EV sector and realized how backwards the “conservative” party was regarding energy. 

Anyway, thank you for voting for democracy.  This election is gonna be crazy. I hope there a lot more people like you.
Thank you, I also grew up conservative, but after what I saw happened in 2016, I became a never Trumper. I agree the conservative party needs a new identity, until then, it's blue down the ballot for me, and from what it seems, many many other Michiganders.
>Last thing I would say to my Democrat friends, please don’t fight and argue political issues with your conservative friends who are also voting for Harris and accidentally push them back into voting for Trump. At least not right now. I have witnessed that happen a couple of times in the heat of an argument. I feel like right now all social issues get set aside and we vote together as Americans to make sure Trump doesn’t end up back in office. 

I appreciate this sentiment on a human level, because it is important to respect people making difficult choices.  But please do remember that for many people, those social issues are embedded in their daily lives because of who they are, and setting them aside just isn't possible.
Nation over party. Congratulations, you've shown your patriotism in an unassailable way. 🙂👍
Harris/Walz is a very moderate choice.  Despite what the right wants to suggest, she's a very moderate Democrat and so is he.

So big picture, you're very likely voting closer to your politics then you think.
Just wanted to say thank you.
As a woman, thank you. 
Thank you for using logic in your voting decision. I hope there are lots more like you.
You made the right call.... Innocent women are dying needlessly from being denied emergency medical procedures

He never planned on winning this election. His plans begin the night of the election and will last for months.
Thanks you for voting and being open minded enough to change your position.  In these days more than ever things are polarized and it's hard to find a middle ground.

While I am staunch Dem right now, I am not oblivious to the fact "my" party may one day shift outside of the lines of what I believe in.  At that time it will be hard for me to vote another way.  I hope I will be able to do what you did if/when that time comes.
>One day I hope we will have two or more viable sane political parties to choose from again instead of feeling like “I have to vote against the other party”. But for now, this conservative stands firmly with the rest of you - and I voted Democrat in the presidential election for the first time.

I'm a "Enemy Within" level of liberal, and I agree. The country needs a counterweight to offer an opposing viewpoint. But it needs a sane and rational one, which I'm not sure the Republicans have been since Falwell took over the party.
Thank you for being sane about your vote and understanding what is at stake.
As a lifelong democrat, I can say with all sincerity that I hope the GOP comes to its senses and kicks this MAGA shit to the curb.

Our country needs multiple voices and multiple viewpoints. What it does not need is a cult that stifles any attempt at civil debate and compromise.

Thank you for voting for your principles. Some day I hope your party and your principles will once again align.
Harris is the conservative choice. Trump wants to burn everything down just so that he won't face the consequences of his actions. He's never been interested in conserving anything, and he only has scorn for our nation and its values.
Thank you and welcome to sanity.
Thank you. For all the republicans voting democrat for the first time - thank you. I genuinely appreciate every republican who has shared their story and why they are voting blue for the first time.
Thanks from a social studies teacher.  Look forward to being back on the right side of issues each, not personally
As someone admittedly center-left, there were parts of the GOP platform that I used to like. Free, unfettered trade. Military aid for US partners. Trade unions that promote democracy. Consolidation of bureaucracy. The current GOP extols the virtues of a bigoted grifter that lived on his daddy’s fortune and the party now bends to whatever benefits him and his cronies directly.
Just remember…tRump isn’t a conservative. I voted straight Dem for the first time as well. 

Country > party > candidate.
Thank you.  I too would vote for someone like John McCain, and I pretty much only vote blue.  We've got to unite over what matters and get back to some normalcy. Most of us just want to let politics go back to the background again. And know that even if we don't agree with everything, we'll be able to live with it. I can't tell you how much I hope you are right about others doing the same as you!
Voting for Harris is the only way you will ever get a viable  Republican Party in your lifetime. It’s going to take a while, but the larger the margin of victory, the faster it will happen.
Thank you for your patriotism 🫡 I really commend those who can make that decision to vote for the other party. I know that can’t be easy when you’ve grown up a certain way and all you’ve ever know is one way. We need more of this in America. I almost voted for Romney back in 2012. And honestly I have a lot of respect for him and other conservatives who are willing to put country over party. Conservatives would be doing themselves a favor to abandon Trump and move on. The country doesn’t want him and his fascist ideals.
I have been conservative and a Christian all my life. I have also lived overseas and it deeply bothers me how many of my Christian friends overseas look at trump and are literally dumbfounded how a party calling itself Christian can have an individual so devoid of a moral compass as the party pick. I listened when he won how many pastors I trusted at the time told everyone to vote for him, and I refused. I said: look at his character! They said, it doesn’t matter, he will give us our judges!

That election I abstained from voting for a presidential candidate, but not this time. After January 6 and so SO many other things, Harris gets all of my vote, my voice, my energy and my prayers.
[removed]
democrats are conservatives though. Any sane conservatives who I could “have a drink with” such as Meijer or Cheney are ousted. GOP MAGA is just a pure fascist cult.
Thank you and welcome!
Thank you for your decency.
Excellent. You did the right thing by not voting for a sociopath conman to be the leader of our nation. Tell a friend! I’m in a similar position and have been able to talk some sense in several friends, neighbors and loved ones. I’m typically not one to publicly voice my political opinions but America can’t afford to allow that low life the chance at destroying our democracy.
Me too
I've been a life long democrat and just want to say I have massive respect for you for having the balls to take a stand. I disagree with a lot of Republican policies in general, but that's not what Trump/maga is. I would vote for 2 more George W Bush presidencies before ever voting for Trump. They have corrupted your political party, and that sucks. I just hope that we can get back to normal, boring politics sometime soon and have rational arguments about things that matter where both sides are fighting for something that benefits the country. Not just one trust fund baby with an overinflated ego and a god complex. 

GG and thank you for doing your part.
& my hope is that millions of other Americans walk into their respective voting booths and follow your lead.
Thank you for your intellectual honesty and commitment to preserving our democracy so we still have the option to disagree about policy cordially.
Cross post this to r/Conservative
No you voted American.
I have a somewhat similar anecdote.  In 2016, I was 100% going to write in Bernie, until I was in the little booth with ballot in front of me.  At that moment, I knew I had to vote for Hillary, and I've never once regretted doing that.
We need two or \[ideally\] more *healthy* political for this Republic to work. Right now, one of the two major parties is very sick, dangerously so.  They need to be sent away to try to sort themselves out.  It's going to take a couple of cycles out of power for the GOP to get the message, at least.
You voted for democracy in the face of fascism.
You are the type of conservative I would love to sit and chat with over a coffee/tea/beer/ what have you. Thank you for being so honest and genuine. I hope this is one of those times in history that becomes a historically positive moment, a time when people came together to protect what they love no matter their political stance. Have a great day friend, thank you for telling your story 
I grew up in an extremely conservative household. My whole young life I was confused why anyone would be a Democrat. My dad would tell me what the "liberals" believe and it made zero sense to me. Then I finally got my first real job outside the home/conservative Christian School/church, and actually met some of those "liberals" I'd heard so much about. Turns out the reason it never made sense to me was because I'd only heard about their beliefs second hand from conservatives. Once actually exposed to people on the left and found out what they actually believe and why, it made a lot more sense than conservatism. 

My recommendation to all my conservative friends and family is to actually talk to people outside the bubble. Liberals do not, in fact, enjoy killing babies, don't hate Christianity on principle (most of them are some flavor of Christian), the most leftist person I know is a gunsmith, gay and trans people just want to exist and to be treated as people (that's their whole "agenda"). Not going to lie, there are leftist weirdos, but no one on the left likes them either. And unlike the current GOP, we don't let that guy anywhere near power, let alone be president. If you're open to learning what those on the left believe and why, you may still not agree with it, but it at least makes sense why someone might be inclined to believe what they believe. As I say to my conservative family members, "I get where you're coming from, it's where I came from too. What I'm increasingly unable to understand is why you're staying there."
This is me... never voted for a Democrat for president prior. It's entirely possible I never will again. Harris has my vote this cycle. Trump is so bad that voting 3rd party isn't enough of a statement of disdain to the republican party for renominating him. Democrat party has awful policies, godawful... but their nominee isn't openly discarding every standard, even the constitution itself, for their own personal gain.
As important as it is to keep Trump out of the WH, i personally think it's even more important to keep the likes of Miller and Vance out.
thank you. we can argue about tax rates in February.
And the sane people of this country thank you 😊
John McCain wasn't a paragon of virtue, but any reasonable person would respect him. If that's your idea of a conservative, I salute you and eagerly await the day decisions like that are a possibility again. John McCain remembered fascism. His family bled to the bone fighting them and America is better than that. Thank you for your vote, when it isn't this dire I hope we can have a more civilized discussion about it.
Thank you for putting America first.
Think about conservatism vs progressivism as personality traits rather political preferences. A conservative looks at the past and the way things are and says “this is good, we should keep things like this and not change too fast it might get worse”. A progressive looks at the past and the present and says “this can be better, let’s make some big changes and it will be better”

Nothing about what trump or Vance and his “post liberals” want to do with this country is conservative. They want big changes, they want to break things.  Conservatives should be terrified of trump.
From a diehard Progressive, thank you.
Trump needs to lose this election and teach republicans that they need better representation
I understand the feeling. I voted 3rd party for the only time ever in 2016. The negative ads had sowed enough doubt in my mind about Clinton. I didn't live in MI or any other swing state at the time, so it didn't really matter. If I had lived in MI then, I would have held my nose and voted for her. But I still regret it to this day because it only helped to give fodder to Trump's ridiculous claim that he really did win the popular vote. He needs to lose bigly next week, and hopefully Republicans get it through their heads once and for all that MAGA is a losing platform.
If Republicans were still the party of McCain, I'd probably still be a Republican. That party is dead.




What remains is a party that revels in ignorance and lawlessness.
I could have written this! I voted “none of the above” in 2016 because I just couldn’t vote for either candidate (I’d vote for Hilary now, easily). I voted Trump in 2020 only because I felt like Biden had been in office a long time without much to show for it. But on January 6, 2021, a switch was flipped in my brain. I changed my party affiliation to Independent. I started to examine my biases. Not did I realize Trump would ruin our country, I had to actively vote against him, not just not vote for him. He is the most despicable man in my lifetime (I’m a late boomer/Gen Jones). Am I 100% confident in Kamala? Not really, maybe 80%. But she needs a chance. I grew up during the women’s movement; we can’t go back!
>and we vote together as Americans to make sure Trump doesn’t end up back in office. 

Well said ++
Thank you for caring about decency and preservation of Democracy!

Just curious, are you a registered republican? I ask because the early voting data would suggest to the public that your vote would help Trump if you were a registered Republican. I am wondering how much conservative Republicans voting for Harris could be confusing any conclusions drawn by early voting data
Welcome! 😁🥰😍
The republican party now is not what it used to be. It doesn't stand for American Values any more.
Thank you!!
Thank you for your service
Thank you 🙌
Thank you for voting.
Your awesome
Thank you for doing the right thing
Well the good news for you is Harris is no further left than 2004 Republicans were. So your vote makes sense and you shouldn’t lose sleep over it. 
Actual leftist have zero representation.
Thank you.  Just thank you.
If someone like John McCain were running for president, I would be disappointed that Harris didn't win, but wouldn't be angry or afraid. I didn't agree with McCain on principle, but I definitely respected him.

Donald Trump is a very real threat to our democracy. You made the right choice.
Good for you.  It’s time the intelligent red voters send a strong message to the rest.  We will not appease your shit taste in leadership.  Nominate better candidates, or keep losing elections.
You sound like me or I like you. Grew up the same way. Am so very tired of this guy and the decisive rhetoric he and his people spew. Thank you for voting.
Thank you for putting your country before party. You're a true patriot. If only there were more like you.
Yup. Speaking as someone that was a child when Bush Senior was president and remembers seeing him on television, I do actually miss sane Republicans that knew things, even if I still disagreed with them on politics. This current incarnation of Republicans is just truly amazing to me, and the only thing that's gonna break the Trumpist/reactionary/protofascist impulses of the current moment is if Republicans lose and lose bigly for a while. Good on ya, dude.
The biggest issue? Thinking Donald Trump is even an option.
It's wild to me that you have to travel and wait in line to vote. I haven't done that since the 90s.
I was a registered republican until 2016. I get it.
Thank you, thank you, thank you. 🙏
> Last thing I would say to my Democrat friends, please don’t fight and argue political issues with your conservative friends who are also voting for Harris and accidentally push them back into voting for Trump.


People who vote conservative because liberals are annoying, are just weak. Liberals find liberals annoying every day.
Thank you. As a moderate living in California, who was born in Lansing, Michigan, I am supremely grateful. I love the coalition that is being built. I pray that enough of us who just want a functioning country will vote for Kamala/Walz!!
Thank you.
Country over party, fellow American. Thank you for helping us stop DJT 🫡
My friend I’ve voted for both parties and am moderate on multiple issues as one can be - no way would I ever vote for Donald Trump
Socially conservative is so funny to me. 

So many republican candidates are living double lives and lie to their voters. Very strange
Thank you. Call your friends.
I think you mean you voted Democrat as a conservat.
[removed]
Welcome to the sane side. I hope that if trump loses this time, he’ll slither back under a rock!
Thank you for voting sanely, OP! As a one-time Michigander with family and friends still there, I know the state’s been challenged to determine what’s right for it against the rhetoric of people like DJT.

I can only hope the electorate can argue—or otherwise engage spirited debate about both issues on which they value —and plainly look at public servants, without somehow compelling someone to “revenge vote” over mere disagreement.

We used to, as Americans, be able to look at electeds and understand that from the municipal servants to Congress, things only get done when some spirit of compromise is reached. We’ve gotten nowhere with the zero-sum thinking.

Thank you for voting in a nuanced manner—and for valuing both your local elections and this general. They’re all important, and most of us need to vest ourselves in the same manner.✌️
When driving through michigan to detroit i saw like 5 pro trump signs and the remaining were all harris signs.
Thank you for voting with your head.
We need more like you.

We don’t need to agree on everything. We don’t need to support the same politicians or even principles.

But we do need to agree on democracy and putting the Whole country first.  
Thank you for putting your country first!
Thank you for your vote, friend!
Thank you
Democracy appreciates you.  One day you will get your party back.  Don't give up
Reading your post and the comments below really gives me hope.  Thank you.  I truly hope others will follow your lead.
If it's any consolation somehow, as what many Americans would call far left (and what the far left would call a neo-liberal) I was going to vote for Chris Christie with a big ass smile on my face given the chance no matter who the democrats ran. In times like these, it's about the health of the nation, not party objectives.
The "inbetweeners".....socially liberal but looking  for fiscal responsibility.

Good for you!  

For me.....humanity is the end all be all.  I would give up every penny, and have all of my friends and family live together pooling our money to survive.  Not a penny to my name type of struggles (yes, I HAVE been there, and yes, I KNOW whwouit's like).  I would take that any day over the future that "he" is proposing.   

My paycheck does not drive this support......human rights does, and I would do it over and over and over again.  This is our future....where do we want to fall?
It's okay. I have always voted for the best candidate for me. NOT by party. (just so happens has MOSTLY been the Democrat)  It's how elections should work.  Kind of like the Oscars-- the best at the job, not just your favorite every time.
Thank you!
 If it helps at all, you should understand that Donald Trump is no conservative. He is a radical. His plans and intentions are to kick over the entire structure of our government and our economy. That is not a conservative stance.
I appreciate you identifying as a conservative and not a republican. It’s a strong distinction. Thanks for sharing your insights with us.
Oof, my condolences you had to grow up as a kid listening to rush limbaugh. That should be listed as a form of child abuse lol.
Reagan would be considered a bleeding heart liberal by today’s standards maga fascist republican party…. the republican party today is an authoritarian hyper evangelical nut case taliban wanting party control over women
You voted AMERICAN
Me, too
I couldn’t possibly agree more with you.  Nope, Trump is NOT conservative.  Neither are any of those other assholes who wrap themselves in the flag and use it for toilet paper all day.
Thank you!!!
Thank you brother. It takes so much to put country over party.

Well done my man.
I too expected McClain to get further and was very disappointed.  He is sorely missed.
Thank you
I think I love you.
I feel it friend. I have two awards for the Number 1 Republican Club from the State GOP in the 1990s. I spent countless hours growing up working on campaigns. My parents met in Republican politics and I went to my first political fundraiser at 6 weeks old (oddly enough it was for a democrat that my parents were friends with). I haven’t voted for a Republican presidential candidate since Romney. Neither has my mom. My dad probably wouldn’t have either, but he passed away in 2008. 

These are wild times, but we gotta do what we gotta do, and that means vote blue.
I think that there are going to be enough voters like you that when the votes are counted Trump loses.
There’s a South Park episode about this. Remember when Mr. Garrison ran for president and started saying the most absurd shit to not get voted, and all his supporters rallied behind him anyway? 

Yeah, it’s happening in real life.
Thank you for putting country over party. I am a lifelong blue voter. I remember voting against Bush, Romney, McCain, those elections all felt critical but nothing like this. I never felt like our democracy was on the line, just policies I disagreed with.
I respect and admire you brother
I think you're amongst the growing group of people purely voting common sense. At least, that's how I feel. I vote for what makes the most sense.
You voted American. Cheers!
There is not a conservative choice this election there is a democrat and a felon running.
As a fellow ex-republican who left during the Bush years with a similar path, Harris' platform is fairly conservative overall.

Trump's popularity is baffling to me, considering the obsession with Clinton's cheating in the 90s.
Me too! Republican who voted blue. It’s not the party I originally signed up with. I’m not proud of what it’s become. Principle over party. Always.
I think most people don’t realize the US is skewed so far to the right that being a moderate is considered a far left extremist here. But to the rest of the developed world we’re moderates or even conservatives.
I think the right’s shift farther right and the left’s shift right in response, also seeing the aftermath of 50 years of “trickle down economics” and money in politics is seriously turning off most Americans being affected.
Yup. Trump would give me a big tax break in my high tax bracket but everything else is just too fucking insane. I have to pay for the privilege to vote for Kamala even though I don’t think she will be a good president- just way better than Trump.

Fiscally conservative is not even a remotely viable choice right now. It’s not just the president either, I’m blue the whole way down the ticket until these maga clowns are gone.
Thank you
Trump really does have the opportunity to be the thing that heals divides this year. Unfortunately they're also divides he deepened.

Thank you for choosing country over party, even if you had to hold your nose a bit to do it. There are likely things we disagree on, I'd love to get back to that being tax code instead of civil rights.
Your words are full of wisdom! Thank you for doing your part 👍
Same here. I will vote R when the party actually shows it starts to Give a shit about the country again
Proud of you
🙌🏼
thank you have my ballot filled out and ready to take tomorrow or Thursday.
Thank you.
Thank you.
As far as I'm concerned you're an American who voted American and not whatever Trump's trying to turn us
F*ck the parties and being cultists. 

You voted for American democracy.
OP is what a Patriot looks like. Bravo!
Similar here too. Was Republican from 1998-2016. I too listened to Rush and Hannity for years. But over time work was during the show and couldn't listen. Soon with their voices gone i cared less and less. I Did not vote for Trump in 2016. I saw he was a total moron. I did not realize how dangerous he'd be though. I went Independent. Then after he won and i saw the party devolve into what it is today. Idiots like Boebert and MTG. I was done. Went full D from 2018-today. Very Red State here so does not do much good. But my voice is out there.
I would consider myself a Democrat and I don't consider Trump a Republican. In fact, I find myself telling my children often (they are teenagers and have only known the Trump GOP) about McCain, Romney, even Bob Dole. How the Republican Party used to be made of people who had views I disagreed with but whom you could trust wanted the best for their country just as much as we did. I just had this conversation tonight with my son about the way Putin got Trump to badmouth fellow American politicians in Helsinki. I said that no American president before him, Republican or Democrat, would ever EVER have talked smack about another American citizen to the leader of Russia. Country was always above party. Sadly, that is no longer the case for the Republican Party at this point in time, and it's beyond depressing to see how many Republican leaders have gone along with this betrayal to real conservatives. 

Anyway, thank you for doing what you did today. Voting for the Democratic candidate does not make you a Democrat, but this year, it makes you a patriot.
As also a conservative, there is nothing wrong against voting against a weird cult.
You sound like me about 20 years ago. Brought up very conservative, my mom loved Limbaugh, etc. I "broke the seal" in 2004 voting for Kerry and realized that the world didn't fall apart and, in fact, liberal policies were more in line with the values I was taught in church (aside from some of the Old Testament which, let's be honest, had some pretty crazy shit in it). Voted D pretty much every election after that (aside from a lapse in judgement in 2016 when I voted for Stein because of residual brainwashing telling me Hillary was bad).
Yeah well, that ain’t the weird part OP. I’m voting for Harris/Walz too and I hope they win as I think it will keep the US stable, but they are offering a centrist-conservative administration. You are voting for a conservative administration. There is currently no viable liberal candidate.

As a centrist-liberal I’m pretty grossed out to hear so much about “ensuring that America maintains the strongest military in the world”, and “border security” being a top priority. From what I can tell, their platform would fit comfortably on the primary stage of Republican candidates in Nixon or Reagan’s presidential runs.

Reagan wanted a form of Universal healthcare. Harris is to the right of that. Reagan never tried to outlaw abortion. He and Harris are on the same page there. Reagan could have started severe cut backs on Social Security, but he saved it. He and Harris are on the same page there - she is not talking about expanding or even shoring it up more than where it already is. Reagan raised taxes 3 times. Harris is proposing no tax increase for almost any working Americans. Adjusted for inflation our Unimaginably Enormous military budget is appreciably larger than under Reagan. Harris is certainly not talking about a reduction of the military budget.

The main difference I can see is that Reagan had a sore spot for unions and Harris has a warm spot for them. Otherwise she is almost a traditional Republican candidate as far as I can see.
Thank you. By voting Democrat, you are voting for your own party to have a chance to crawl back from the tailspin that it descended into under MAGA. I came to the United States when Trump had just began his term. I’ve never known the Republican Party without Trump. I just voted early in my first presidential elections since getting my citizenship, blue up and down the ballot. I am looking forward to learning more about what we have in common, discussing policies in good conscience, and making each other and our country stronger when the Republican Party comes back from the MAGA chokehold.
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 thank you
Thank you
Thank yoi
Thank you for voting for Harris!!
Bravo OP. Well said. Couldn’t agree more and thank you for putting country over party.
While I didn't agree with McCain I found him worthy of respect. I didn't doubt that he did what he thought was best for the nation where time and again donald has prove. Through action or inaction he's out for himself passing laws that benefit his wallet and gutting programs that help disadvantaged people. He's so far gone he thought staging a photo op at McDonald's would make him relatable to low income earners.
I’ve done the same. It’s for the preservation of democracy
You made a decision to be on the right side of history.  Our country thanks you for strength to stand up to what is right
The content of this sub seems so curated and inorganic.
Good job!
Thank you 🥹
Thank you!
🙌🏼
Since my mother's side of the family explained what it meant to be a Roosevelt Democrat, both major parties today are right-wing in comparison. It's just that one of the two has more common sense in controlling the economy, than the other.
Same
I hate the temporary system because I am similar to you.  I hate that we have an essential gang war going on for our political offices. I cannot vote for either side.
You are a hero
Thank you.
Thank you, friend.
I don't understand how you think this is strange when the gop represents zero conservative values.  None.  Zilch.  They have no values, and they are explicit about that fact.  

Vote democrat, because they are closer to 'conservative' than the right wing currently.

Don't pretend it's strange.
Thank you for voting Harris this election, and thank you for sharing your experience!
I salute your hard choice, fellow American.
I appreciate your views. Your experience sounds very similar to mine. This resonates.
Respect. Thank you for doing your part to stand up for our country. I look forward to putting Trump and Trumpism behind us and going back to politics as usual. Never thought I would ever long to go back to the days of “politics as usual”!
Thanks.  However, you voted Democratic not Democrat.
there is nothing wrong with being republican leaning. voting for trump specifically, however, is inexcusable cult behavior. congrats for not falling for it.
The sane Republicans are doing the same thing. Honestly, the whole GOP is compromised at this point. It needs to be broken into maga and actual Republicans, but there seem to be more of the maga variety. Until they clean out the traitors and learn some decency again, they can't be allowed to win. This doesn't end with Trump. The rest of the GOP is still going to try to ram Project 2025 down our collective throats, Constitution be damned. The Republicans with honor are quietly stepping back instead of stepping up to fight the trend of hatred, lawlessness and treason that has rotted the party from within. Thanks for voting your conscience.
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! 😭
Tapping in from Kansas to say thank you!
We can always go back to arguing once fascism is excised from the core of the Republican Party platform. There are many directions a country can go and it’s important to have different voices in normal times. These times are not normal. Thank you for voting your conscience.
I hope there are thousands if not millions that do the same!
In this election, there's nothing strange about Republicans voting for Harris.  
Common sense sometimes prevails
MAGA got its claws into the Republican Party and has been injecting its poisonous and divisive rhetoric for years.  

Hopefully, Trump will lose the election, a wiser Republican Party will arise, and the Democratic Party will also grow to match it, so that we can have 2 good candidates to choose from. 

I long for the day that we can actually say, both candidates are awesome, and I prefer this candidate, but you really can’t go wrong with the other one either.
Thank you!!
Proud of you dude! Took guts to go with what you believe is right.
Just wanted to say thank you for believing in and voting for democracy.
I too grew up listening to "Maja Rushie" but was aware enough to realize that The Republican party was scum after abandoning New Gingrich's contract with America at the first opportunity. Politicians (above the state representative level) are things to be bought and sold, like the lawyers most of them used to be. So, it used to be one could tell how a politician could vote based on who they accepted donations from. 

That changed with MAGA for the worse, as this cultural civil war we are in, as the Boomers die, and as a result the remaining ones lose power to control everything. And like the entitled children the Boomers are, they throw a fit collectively, which is the basis of the MAGA movement. They don't care about liberties, or rights, minus the ones they themselves endorse. As a Libertarian, that's horrific to me. 

I'm glad the "Greatest Generation" for the most part isn't alive to see the absolute cesspool of morality that the boomers (generally) represent. I personally cannot stand Kamala Harris's views on collectivization and socialism, but she's not batshit insane like Trump is. Harmful, having an axe to grind, and potentially inept as a politician, but she's not insane, nor threatening to act like a dictator on day one, or praising Hitler. She might have a Che poster in her closet, but at this point I'd take that over Trump.
To be honest I feel like this is an election is a referendum where conservative voters know they need to go back to the old conservative party and try to win in 2028 with a much more grounded and a candidate that unites not divides.
Yo my dude, glad that you voted blue and are open minded and I hope that you apply some of that open mindedness to social issues in the future too. 

Lots of people out there in the world with a lot of different vibes but we’re all just people trying to live in whatever body fate gave us.
Thank you
The founding fathers and Democracy thank you!
Thank you! From the bottom of my heart, thank you!
Thank you!
Bless you for saving America.
Thank you
You voted for the best candidate as an American
Congratulations, you’re normal. You are what political beliefs should be. Not radicalized. Not ruined by propaganda. Just your own opinions that are largely unremarkable.
Thank you for putting country over party.
If the Republicans keep losing elections and major changes happen, like Texas flipping blue, the Republican Party will literally need to rebuild its politics to appeal to voters. I vote democrat but I want very badly for the republicans to need to have a major overhaul. The democrats would also potentially shift in response if they lose voters to a changed political opponent.
Thanks for voting for Harris!
You didn't vote Democrat, you voted for democracy. 

You can always vote Harris out in four years if you don't like the job she's doing.

You can't say that for Trump and the push for fascism that he's spearheading.
We are in the middle of a major restructuring of our political parties. The Democratic Party is evolving into the pro-democracy party attracting urban, educated, and successful people. It’s the home of the never-Trumpers. It will be less about social injustice and more about safeguarding our political structure and combating the radical, suppressive elements of our country.
Thank you for your courage my fellow American!  Also my fellow Michigander!!!  Michiganders always make me proud.  Because of what you did today, you helped make it possible for Republicans to come back their senses.  Someday there will be a Republican worth your respect again.
Thank you.
You're not alone. There are tons of us and the need for the Republican party to ditch the dipshits and rediscover its conservative roots has never been more dire.

I have to wait until the 31st to vote early, but as a lifelong conservative, I'm going to give every vote I've got to the party that doesn't placate a fascist.
THANK YOU! 

And I'm pretty liberal, but I respected McCain (except for the Palin thing) because he had ethics. That's gone in the GOP today. 

And yes, I totally agree with you—I've seen a few liberals lash out because people voted for Trump last time, even if they're voting for Harris now. They've obviously realized a few things and it alienates them if you scold them.
It’s not strange to pick the closest middle ground versus an absolute disaster
Actually don’t blame you. The parties swing from their beliefs but please, whatever you do dont take advice from political ads. On both sides they lie
I hope there are many, many more stand up citizens such as yourself this time around!
Thank you for voting country over party.
Good for you, and also?

Why do “conservatives” get to insist that we must respect and not question their “values,” when that’s all you seem to do the other direction?

Are we just supposed to swallow your poor opinions and lack of respect for your fellows and their life decisions, while being required to tolerate and not mention yours, on the off chance you may take offense?

Because that’s what you’re saying here. Just wondering.
I understand where you’re coming from and thank you for voting the way you did.

I have always been liberal and I even campaign for Bill Clinton, but when I got into the voting booth, I just kept thinking about that one credible allegation of rape and I just could not do it. I wound up voting for Ross Perot.

Sometimes it’s hard. I didn’t want Perot, but I just could not pull a lever for someone who probably raped someone.
I can assure you that as a liberal (of no party designation) would 100% have done the same if this situation were reversed.

Hateful populism just has no fucking place in my country no matter who is doing it.

And you're not even in a bad position considering the dems have had to make a mountain of concessions to reach the moderate conservative voters. But thing is, those aren't massive concessions when it comes down to what happens when the opposing party's wingnuts get in power.

I guess a good parallel was, being from Wisconsin myself, when I got to the army how my opinion of Michiganders and Chicagoans altered greatly because I was now exposed to the psychos from Alabama and Florida. It was no longer 'f'n FIB Bears fans' and more like 'you guys are WAY more normal and similar to me than I was giving you credit for.

I would hope to consider you, a moderate conservative, as a closer cousin to me, a moderate liberal, than you would be a cousin to the far right demagoguery. The deep end of the pool is a very steep drop off.

And I'll let you in on a secret, I'm a HUGE foreign policy guy and there was a once upon a blue moon where Republicans might have laid claim to that idea and maybe made me have to weigh my options more. Not anymore. Republicans are the party of 'sell America out' now. You gotta be fucken kidding me with guys like Mike Flynn and the endless list of Russian influence in the GOP today.
Thank you for this.  Honestly your vote shows you are true to your original values of being a conservative.

Because Trump isn’t conservative or liberal — both terms describe a spectrum of politics in a democracy.

Trump is a fascist.  It’s a position that’s not compatible with a democratic country.
You’re not alone. My father in law is a long-time Republican voter and made many remarks this time around that he could not bring himself to vote for DT this go around. I think, I hope, I pray that the depravity has turned enough people to put their party affiliation aside for the moment
I am right there with you. My family is republican and for most of my life I felt like that was the side that worked for my best interests. I probably started to slide more central earlier than you but honestly never thought Trump could win and even if he did we had enough fail safes in place to keep him in check. I really wasn't a fan of Hillary but thought she would probably win and we would move on. If anything the final straw was not just Trump but all of the racism and the childishness that became common in so many of our representation that pushed me completely away. It really is a very strange situation we have been positioned in when we start doubting everything we thought we knew for decades.
Thank you for your service.
I’m surprised I haven’t run out of upvotes yet..😂😂 Thaks everyone ✅
Thank you! I know there are conservatives out there who would not join the cult. Hopefully you guys can form a 3rd party and bring back our checks and balances. Right now our only choices are to save our country or let it go to sh**.
Thank you!!! Country over party!
I think, regardless of party, we all are more closely aligned in our thinking than the media makes it seem. Don't get me wrong, there are issues we genuinely do deeply disagree on, but I think there are economic issues we're closer on. Democrats don't want the government to waste money, either. Most of us think you should work for your money. We want to have good jobs, affordable housing, etc. We might have different ideas on how to get there, but we want to get there.

But Trump has taken those issues off the table. Now it's about stuff like...do we want a democracy or not? Do we want to be ruled by a king again? And look, I get it, if I was convinced our elections were compromised, I'd want to fight, too. But what Trump is offering is not better elections after we get rid of all the "enemies from within." He's offering, as an alternative, despotism with him in charge.

And what it took to convince so much of the country that he actually won the election was so, freaking, little. All these years, all that bluster, and after all that, Trump goes on Joe Rogan and can't even present ONE piece of evidence he won the election? He says he'll bring it next time? When he filed all those lawsuits, his lawyers wouldn't even CLAIM there was fraud? 

Its frustrating to see so many people not see Trump for what he is: a con man, and not even a particularly good one. I see people talk about him and it's not even reality. Like, they just create a vision of him in their heads and pretend he's that instead of who he really is. He's pretty much become an imaginary friend to millions of people. How are we supposed to convince millions of people that their *imaginary friend* is bad? When they can just make up whatever they want about him and believe it like it's gospel truth? Joe Biden said in 2020 we were in a battle for the soul of this nation. In 2024, it feels like we're in a battle for reality itself. Like, it's a battle just to convince people that reality is what's real.

Imo, we are so past the old debates and arguments and things are just so far off into the weeds that the election can't even about those things anymore. I look at the times when the elections were about Medicare and social security as quaint, simple times, and it makes me sad.
You voted America as an American.

The conservatives didn’t field a candidate for you.

Your options were American Democracy or Pluto-Theocratic Fascism.

You made the right decision based on available options.
Thanks for having the courage to speak up and voting on yourconscience.
Thank you
TELL ALL YOUR CONSERVATIVE FRIENDS TO VOTE DEMOCRAT 🗳
What are the values you have that you consider liberal?
Been here. I used to wear a shirt that said “I voted McCain and all I got was this lousy president”. I’d feel better about it now.
Astroturfing
I’ll take things that didn’t happen for 500 Alex.

More paid propaganda/bots on Reddit.
At some point there has to be a solber reckoning on the side of the conservatives with how they brought us to this point. I'm a progressive independent who believes we need all NON HATEFUL ideologies to have a healthy democracy. What we saw in the first trump presidency, Jan 6 and during his campaign needs to be brought out into the day light and explained before I can consider conservatives to have honest points of view again. I own my complicity with Democrats that talk out of both sides of their mouth. I'm not proud of it and I hold their feet to the fire. But both sides are not the same.
Nikki Haley would have won by a landslide in every swing state, and I say this as a dyed-in-the-wool Democrat.

I have no idea why the Republican party does not act in its best interests.  Actually, I do, but it makes me sad thinking about it.
So very Christian of her for to attack you verbally like that.
Bro, I was wearing camo, placing a gun in a fishing boat, when someone jumped down my throat.. that I was a brainwashed liberal who watched too much CNN. The world is in fact, gone cray. 

-I said Ron Desantis was an asshat for his book "banning" shenanigans. That was all. 
-And I never watch CNN. But I sure as shit don't watch Fox.
I am slightly left of center, but my dad thinks I am a far left liberal all because I said we need to better address school shootings. I am a teacher, and my dad has never owned guns, never shot a gun, or even wanted to shoot a gun.
I don’t consider myself liberal, but I do support Medicare for all and higher taxes on the ultra rich. That said, I’m a firm believer in individual rights and constitutional protections. I don’t own any guns but absolutely support 2A. I love hunters and the idea of using firearms for self-sufficiency and self protection and protection of home and family. I absolutely support tighter gun laws, restrictions, and more rigorous purchasing processes to help ensure fewer people who might end up being violent criminals are able to buy a gun.

I’m non-religious and believe the collective “church” to be problematic at times, but also firmly believe everyone in America has a right to religious freedom and expression. I value the melting pot of diversity I was always taught America became a beacon in the world for. Unfortunately there’s become a clear voice of hatred coming from the GOP in the last decade especially that leaves a very bad taste in my mouth.

I believe myself to be relatively centrist with conservative leaning individual ideals and liberal leaning social ideology. But conservatives would probably call me a liberal pussy anyway.

The Republican Party of today has become an obvious grift-a-thon set out to deregulate business in every unethical way. The tax cuts for the rich sicken me - that sweet sweet trickle down never fuckin works for the people. And the projection, hypocrisy, and lack of any moral compass anymore will ensure I never vote republican. 

I want to see tax dollars going to good use. Invest in education and health care and mental health and infrastructure. Set up future generations for success. I don’t fucking understand how we’ve allowed politics to be so blatantly toxic and parasitic to the American legislature and economy. 

So while I’m not out here shouting Harris from
the rooftops, she does have my vote so that we can squash trumps ass like a bug. I want better options. I want leaders. Real leaders who are actually passionate about putting the needs of the people first, changing bullshit in politics and in legislature, and setting our kids up for success. I don’t think that’s too much to ask.
The military aspect is a big deal to me. I have 2 nephews signing up. One took his oath but has to wait until he graduates. I thought about what Trump said about using the military on American citizens. And I wondered, would my nephews obey the order to kill Americans, or refuse illegal orders and possibly be jailed or worse? It's just such an insane scenario, I just can't believe we are at the brink like this.
I can’t think of many people less reflective of Christian values than the current GOP candidate.
Props to you for voting with your conscience
If you enjoy freedom and liberty and you’re against authoritarianism, you are a liberal. You may be a conservative, but sounds like you’re also a liberal. 

The antithesis of conservative is progressive. America was founded as a liberal nation - read any of our founding fathers, they say it verbatim. Now ask why the term liberal has been perverted into some “awful” thing…why do terms like “libtard” exist? It’s to dilute what America is truly about and usher in authoritarianism.
My endless frustration with this fascist agenda is that so many people confuse being patriotic with supporting the flag. That’s called nationalism. Being patriotic is supporting your troops. Who are there to support you.
I've had preferences in other elections, this is the first time I am actively voting AGAINST someone. 

This is the first time I've ever thought about prepping guns and making sure there is food for a bit in the house....

....an election.
Yeah.  The Detroit stuff really made me angry.
Thank you.
Right on👍🏼
I heard what evangelicals said about Clinton in the 90s. Now, I watch them embrace a far more flawed individual because of the R beside his name. It's weird. It's hypocritical. It's disingenuous. And because this candidate is so unhinged, it's dangerous. The "Christians" voting for Trump are "straining at gnats and swallowing camels."
One day you will learn Christianity and political conservatism are one and the same.  They both need to force your behavior to conform to their worldview to validate their backward thinking.  

I specifically said politically and not values.  As most of my liberal views are rooted in my conservative values.  

Like small government.  By that I mean there should only be law around an action that causes physical or financial harm to another.  Gay marriage ain't one of those things.  So I support it.    
  
I believe in a free market and by that I mean an even playing field.  When someone can dominate a market just based on capital and not the quality of their good or service you no longer have a free market.  You have returned to Oligarchy.  Something Adam Smith specifically warned against without a strong federal authority that is funded enough to fight "rentiers and manipulators" which is precisely what our economy has become.  
  
I believe hard work should be rewarded so I support unions.  Labor is also a market force that can and should be withheld to get a better deal for access to it.   
  
So basically I am a raging leftist (American) simply because I live by my conservative values instead of weaponizing them to enact retribution on people who don't conform to my social wishes.

Remember, Trump is not a republican, except in name. I never left the Republican Party. It left me.
That conservative parties are the "good economy" party is the most pervasive and poisonous lie that has been maintained throughout the world. Each election people are presented this false dichotomy of "progressive social reform, or financial wellbeing."


A vote for left wing parties is a vote for BOTH.
> Growing up in the 70s and 80s, I believed that the republicans were the fiscally responsible party

In the past 50 years, under all Republican presidents the net job growth was 1 million jobs.

Under all Democratic presidents, net job growth was 50 million jobs.
Pretty much how it is now. That's not to say that Democrats don't have a lot of work to do on putting up a better pool of candidates. They most certainly do. Like 8 years ago they honestly thought we would prefer Hillary over Burnie. But I digress. The Democrat party is far from perfect. Oftentimes they're just as much corporate shells as the Republicans. BUT....... Trump and maga are completely different beasts. They don't care anymore. It doesn't matter who has to be hurt so long as it's not them. I keep thinking about that bridge in, Baltimore I want to say I could be wrong. When that tanker hit the bridge. In the old days both parties would come together to fix a crisis because a major port town getting disrupted would hurt everybody. But now the goal is to disrupt and make sure nothing gets done to spite the other side. We need to get back to functional and quite frankly boring politics.
Welcome aboard, it's a big tent!  I grew up in a republican household, it took me until 2008 to come to my senses.
As a life long democrat who proudly voted for Obama during my first election, I have always felt this way. Democrats give a shit about giving kids lunches. Republicans would rather burn their money than give it to the people that need it most. I have yet to be convinced of anything else. Every single thing I learned about Regan just made me think he sucks. Regannomics didn’t do shit. He closed mental hospitals and homeless shelters. The disaster that was the war on drugs. And basically to boil down the last 16 years, it’s been: democrats want to give you healthcare and and easy ways to have it. The republicans think everything is communism and would rather let you die of cancer. That is all to say: I’m very glad you realized that Vice President Kamala Harris actually gives a fuck about you. 


*edit sorry I’m not from MI guess this came up on my feed and I clicked it without reading the thing lol
Funny thing is, Republicans have added more to the national debt and created far less economic growth and far fewer jobs than democrats in the past 50 years. By actual data, Democrats are the more fiscally Conservative Party.
I’m 33 and this is my view too, and I’m sure the view of a large percentage of Americans. All I can ever remember is democrats being sensible and republicans pushing against positive change. It doesn’t even make sense until you realize someone is paying them to say it.

And now they can’t win elections because their ideas suck, but they still want to win, so fascism.
I skew liberal personally, but I have absolutely no problem with anyone going conservative. 

But Trump is not really a Republican, he is a threat to democracy who calls himself a Republican.

Anyone who votes for him is either crazy, uninformed, stupid, or waiting to cash in on the tax breaks he will give exclusively to the Billionaires.
I grew up hearing republicans were the fiscally responsible party from my republican family. They worshipped Reagan, another celebrity cult of personality. Then, with only the most cursory of investigation, it became apparent that tax cuts don’t pay for themselves, and that is reflected in deficits under republicans. Reagan absolutely nuked the national budget, and every republican since has carried on the tradition.
As a lifelong democrat I think there are definitely times we could use more pragmatism, but compared to crazy train I agree with your general assessment.
I just stumbled across this thread, but you literally just described me, except growing up in the 80s and 90s. Then Bush and Iraq happened, and I started to see the Republican party different, yet I voted for Trump in 2016 because I can’t stand the Clintons, let’s be clear I still can’t stand the Clintons. But after 2016 so much changed in my life, and the vote for Trump in 2016 was more of a reflection of who I was at that time. 2020 I voted third-party, and I’m voting Democrat I think probably for the first time ever for president. Because of a lot of reasons you said.
A couple of days ago I saw a car with 5ish stickers that were trump stickers or variations of “go democrat, go broke”

…it was an early 2000’s Toyota hatchback with big dents all over.
Hello. I have a fond affection for godless transgender socialists. I’m a pastor, but I believe in your right to live your life how you see fit, not according my convictions about Christian orthodoxy.  I also think a little bit of socialism goes a long way, and we could certainly use some when it comes to healthcare, the power grid, and a few other things.
> I'd rather squabble with you over tax reform than fight with fucking neo-nazis over basic human rights.

This.
People forget that years ago, the GOP had a progressive wing and the Dems had a conservative wing and considerable overlap between the two parties.

We called these people “Americans”
Hey, if this brings us all closer together, it may have been worth it.  We don’t need to agree about everything.  We do need to care about each other.
Honestly, even if I disagree with some of the more conservative policies, if a little compromise gets us better unity and less division, I will take it
Yes, this! "I'd rather squabble with *you* over tax reform than fight with *fucking neo-nazis* over basic human rights."
I'm an angry leftist. Not the crunchy marxist type but I've got some big feelings about rich folk. I say we bring the disenfranchised Republicans in. We've got a chance to make some actual change with them. Shunning them is doing nobody any good.
It was Palin.  I have grown to see the error of my ways, but i think I would have voted McCain if not for her.  And I do believe she was the official entrance of bat sh!t crazy to the republican party.
I’m a liberal democrat through and through but you could RESPECT the hell out of John McCain. He was an honorable human. A good man. You would not have to stop being friends with people for voting for John McCain. You just cant equate him with a MAGA republican.
Hey, me too! I was a John McCain Republican in 2008 as well.
Am a progressive Democrat, and I would not have been mad or scared if he had won. Sad yes, mad and scared, no. He feels like the kind of guy who would have actually listened to the American people.
I wasn’t quite old enough to vote in 2008. If I had, I would’ve voted for John McCain. By 2012, however, I voted for Obama. I’ve voted blue ever since, but I’m a registered Independent.
I second that.
I Also voted for McCain.
And while I don't believe everything Harris says/supports. I am aware that Trump has been bat shit crazy from the beginning.
He's not an idiot, but he's has an obvious agenda and has always had. Trump first, everyone else last.
Vice President Dick Cheney (R) - “In our nation’s 248-year history, **there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump**, He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him. **He can never be trusted with power again**.”

Hard to say most Republicans would when all of them support the guy who won’t.
And if he wins, SCROTUS has given him a reason not to obey it. Imagining Trump with total immunity is terrifying, considering how petty he is
The difference for me is I probably could have voted for McCain if I didn’t love Obama so much. I’m a lifelong Democrat but I respect him immensely and it’s disgusting the things that were said about him by Trump
One could only hope. I feel he will never actually be totally held responsible for his actions 
Until we find a way to handle Fox News, this country will continue to have serious problems. It may not be Trump who assumes power, but it will be a MAGA Republican.
There’s no coming back for the Republican party, at least not in the next 4-8 years. MAGA republicans are still in high positions of power and until they’re all gone they’re still a disease to the party. I fear that the only lesson they’re going to learn from this is to keep their project 2029 playbook a lot more hidden.
*My message to conservatives is this: You only need vote for her once, and he’s gone. After that, reclaim your goddamn party.*

J. D. Vance.
Kamala Harris has spoken about him positively many times too. I [love this clip](https://youtu.be/ysav3IiLRYU?si=a9TGZITxnpZePgwM) where she talks about how he saved The Affordable Care Act.
I was really hoping maga would start into it's own party. 

I have nothing against Republicans, but maga are just pure shit.

The left and right both have their whackos but holy hell maga had their Messiah and they'll do anything for him. Republicans only vote for him because he had the R next to his name and they've learned to hate Dems. I disagree with how Biden has managed things but holy shit Trump is fucking terrifying.
Hi! I just want to say that transgender treatment for minors is very rare and always minimal (hormone blockers that is all). I have two friends who have been through it. Both refused treatment to their kids until they were older but let them dress how they wanted and be called what they wanted. It is a very personal issue and very hard for families. I just wish people could understand it is not a political issue it is very private and serious.
I was thinking this same thing. I won’t be surprised if the voting turn out reports have higher numbers this election. It’s genuinely kind of scary.
My dad has threatened to disown me in the past year if I voted democrat… I voted today for Kamala.

We don’t bring up politics. Over the last few months I’ve seen positive changes. Small such as he can see how the millennials and beyond are going to college and graduating saddled with debt and low paying jobs. He grew up in the work hard and it pays off! There I was shocked…

Today we talked about abortion. Without yelling. A small point that really got thru to him was this. 

First off: any loss in medicine is considered an abortion. Miscarriage is an abortion.

Take away viable healthy babies in utero. Regardless if women wants or not, throw it away in this argument.

Babies with non survivable genetic or horrendous defects are being born. Or living (IMO) a terrible life that will bankrupt a family. Maternal and infant deaths increasing. 

Side note: America already had a huge problem with higher than other first world countries maternal mother deaths. Now it’s worse.

Docs are too scared to help bc they risk their license. Docs are moving out of states to be able to treat pts. Maternal wards are shutting down all over bc of this. He didn’t believe me and I easily found proof.

Now… think about all the women who want to have babies and those babies need prenatal care and to be born. Now these moms have to drive much much further for access to care to take care of their baby.

If the mother experiences a medical emergency that fast care could save the baby… it may no longer be possible bc of these laws.

These laws don’t only affect women who want to abort for whatever reason but it affects women who desperately want their baby!!!!

Sorry for the rant, but it may help others!
We can go back to arguing because we’ll be allowed to. Trump has already said what he wants to do to those who don’t agree with him (aka “the enemy within”).
Well said
🩷🙏
Fascists always pick targets to rally their supporters against.
I think it's less about the transgender people and more about the "other" factor. It used to be gays, but that's not nearly so scary anymore. People realized gay folks weren't breaking in the window, snatching people up- trying to rape em- so the GOP had to move on down the line to another marginalized group americans were less familiar with. Transgender folks fit the bill- their different, strange, they want you to use different pronouns than Jesus used, they're corrupting the helpless children with positivity and afformation- etc.
The fact that they're running anti-trans ads during NFL football games is actually sickening Nazi bullshit and they have to lose.
I was thinking about this situation yesterday. Ask the average American to list the issues they care about and you'll hear things like the economy, crime, healthcare, schools. Trans people don't make the list. But this is the hill they're going to die on?
Thank you.
My grandmother never voted because she would have canceled out her husband's (GOP) vote. I am happy any time I see someone voting for themselves or in spite of if they might balance someone else out.
There's a lot of video out there about you being able to do what you want when you get to the ballot box. Thanks for canceling him out. We all appreciate it.
I’m glad your parents came around. I’ve tried with my dad, reminding him of how during my second pregnancy and second miscarriage, that I had to have a dnc. If I hadn’t been able to, what would’ve happened? And he has 2 18yo granddaughters and a 10yo granddaughter…what if they were to need help and not be able to get it? His response “it’s legal in Michigan” 😞 not if he wins and imposes a national ban.
Yep. Same. 100% against crazy.
Removed per rule 2: Foul, rude, or disrespectful language will not be tolerated. This includes any type of name-calling, disparaging remarks against other users, and/or escalating a discussion into an argument.
I am staunchly Democrat, and I am not particularly happy with what happened to Meijer. We need to encourage more Republicans towards sanity and to put country before party, and he was primaried so Dems could have an easier opponent to win his district.
Instant ban, lol.
I'm a Canadian but if all Republican candidates were like McCain, the world would be a better place. I still remember him reassuring a frightened Republican voter that Obama would destroy the country and he talked her down and spoke positively about Obama event hough they had different political ideas. No way Trump would do that. Or most politicians.. for that matter.  Much respect McCain!
I'm in  Colorado so no idea why I get Georgia and Wisconsin also. Glad to see people making choices based on the candidate, not the party.
There's definitely been some astroturfing in city subs within swing states, for sure.  Difference being it's coming from US-based volunteers related to any number of Democratic Party-leaning PACs.  This in comparison to the Russian-fueled disinformation honeypot known as /r/walkaway.

Not just that, but we've seen so many real-life examples of prominent Republicans or those in Trump's former cabinet (well, at least those not in prison) coming out and supporting Harris to an unprecedented degree.
No hate like Christian love 😇
Just made it very clear to my parents that I struggle to respect them as a whole because they support Trump. As life long Christians. I spelled out in no uncertain terms that I am just dumbfounded as to how they can reconcile putting a man like that in power who is the exact opposite of every moral and Christian value they claim to hold. Christians often struggle with the instruction to love everyone and strive to be Christians like, but some of us are truly trying and calling out the crap along the way.
Christianity is just some concept they use to feel entitled to control others, they don’t care for its actual substance in the least. They could just as well pretend to worship something else.
Additionally, keeping people poor makes them much easier to manipulate and control because they are too worried about making ends meet to fight back against injustices. When we have a large, prosperous middle class people begin to rage against the machine (1960s/70s war protests, ERA, etc…).
Trump aligns himself to the money. This time he's largely running to avoid prison.
I agree.  When the Republican party endorsed Trump I changed my registration to Democrat.
Also, remember, we are Americans first.

It is easy for me to say because I am party agnostic, but we seem to lose sight of this. We are Americans first.
Trump's extremism is not Republican.... It's alt-right nationalism and Nazism.
Pretty much every accusation Trump makes is a confession. It would be comical if he wasn’t so dangerous. Every RHINO is a better Republican than Trump will ever be. Trump and Russia have infiltrated the Republican Party to the core.
I wish this message was spoken more often. Trump is a Republican as much as he is a Democrat. He is only interested in himself and his political party is MAGA. I don’t really refer to Republicans as Republicans or Conservatives anymore because I realize that Trump has transformed the Republican Party into his own personal army who will do his bidding no matter how insane and nonsensical he gets. We all need to vote as Americans to fight off a very real threat to our democracy and our core values when it comes to how our nation functions. I think we are all patriots. I think we all want what’s best for our families, friends and neighbors but we may disagree on exactly what that is. However, right now all of our families, friends and neighbors are being threatened in various ways by a man that will stop at nothing to gain power and keep it. I wish I was saying this to be dramatic but it’s the truth. We need to get past this so we can go back to our good ol political system where one person wins and the other loses but everyone respects our democracy by shaking hands and coming back to vote again in 4 years. That is the American way. That is what’s right. That is what we should all be voting to preserve. This isn’t Democrats vs Republicans. It’s America vs. DJT. I sincerely hope reason and decency prevails. Good luck to all of us.
TBH they left sanity sometime around 1980.
Trump has received the Republican nomination by a wide margin for 3 consecutive presidential elections.  Name any other candidate in history who can claim that.  Go on...name them!

It's ludicrous to claim that he's "not a Republican".  He _defines_ what it means to be Republican.  He didn't _steal_ the Republican party away from "real" Republicans; he showed us who they truly were all along.
No truer words.
I hope you're open to the idea that he's actually as Republican as Nixon and Reagan, and that perhaps the stories we're told about the good Republicans are wrong. Giuliani was always like this. Bob Dole died a Trumper and was indeed probably always like this. Etc.

It's all been a clever narrative to consolidate corporate power via an unholy alliance with fundamentalist Christians and white supremacists.
Screw the Republican Party of old. Preach about morals, let progressives win by making abortion the top issue, spend trillions starting forever wars. Good F’ing riddance.
While I’m sorry it feels like that - he is a Republican. He is, in fact, the most prominent one in 40 years. He’s by far the most popular. If this isn’t the pinnacle of the party I’ve seen evolving down this path since the 80s… well, I don’t know what else to tell ya. 

Perhaps you’re not a Republican anymore, they seem to have shifted the definition a bit right recently.
I used to think that, but the Republican Party followed Trump. They decided it was practical to align with him to preserve their electoral power. Perhaps it was. But nobody can convince me that this isn’t who they are as a party. They either share Trump’s values or have no values… and as I type that, it may be the same thing.
Eh, it's closer to the a distillation of the republican party. Trump is VERY Reagan, just a little more open with his racism.
I miss my conservatives. I’m a tree hugging socialist liberal but someone has to be sensible with the money.
TFG is the true RINO v legacy Republicans.
Purely put of curiosity, what about the republican party left you? I'm 3rd party, but seems to me the Dems are picking up the old neo-cons. Is that what left you?
This.
The part that blows my mind is the amount of irate violent people there are in this country. Want to get my vote? Don't pander to the audience that can't spell their name or shoot me in the face because I am a woman with short hair.

This whole thing looks like a set up for martial law and an economic collapse
The Key Bridge in Baltimore. Named after Francis Scott Key, who wrote our national anthem while witnessing a battle take place over those very waters. So yes, it would be an appropriate place for people to come together and remember we are all Americans.
I, too grew up with conservative (Republican) parents. In politics, like religion, we tend to follow the examples of our parents. Not that I'm proud of it, but I voted for Nixon in 1968. I used to debate with my best friend, until I voted for Clinton, then Gore, then Obama and have never voted Repubican since DJT ran.

Trump has copied much from Reagan, including maga and tax cuts. But few people remember that after Reagan tax cuts in 1981, Reagan was smart enough to see the damage these cuts would do to the national debts that there were tax changes in '82, '83, '84. '86, '87, as well as 1990 and 1993. All of these changes effectivley negated the 1981 tax reductuction.

But will Trump ever do the same? He either doesn't understand how tariffs work or he just lies to his suppoters. I argued with a co-worker in 2015/2016 that electing Trump would be the worst thing that could happen to our country.  I HATE BEING RIGHT.
Thank you! As a bisexual black woman who was raised on the good book: God gave us his only son so that would appreciate sacrifice. I truly believe that to love others is to give when you have more than you need. 

Luke 6:38
“Give to other people and God will give to you. He will give to you even more than you gave”.
Some aspects of socialism could be confused as being neighborly. We shouldn't shy away from being a good neighbor because  it overlaps with a buzzword we don't like.
I wish more pastors were like this. I’d probably have stayed with religion if it wasn’t for the fear and hate lately from my local Catholic church, that and trying to force their beliefs on others.
Hi! Not necessarily a goddless heathen over here, I was raised Lutheran (WELS, to be exact). However, I've come to believe everyone was given pieces of the puzzle, but our disadvantage comes from thinking we have the whole picture in our pocket. It always felt arrogant to believe that any group/kingdom/country was the "chosen people". There are threads that connect many faiths and mythos, many creation stories put sound at the center. And so many religions claim that their deity(s) is our father or mother, and that we are the children. I no longer believe this is figurative or metaphorical; how an artist dotes upon artwork. In relation to God or the Gods, we are the next generation of whatever He/She/It/They are.

It's nice to see open-minded people within the church. Thank you.
But you DO believe in Christian orthodoxy. It’s great and all to try to let people be and pretty harmless when it’s just you, but on a societal scale it’s really quite dangerous for some people who are just trying to live in the body they’ve found themselves in to not be accepted and marked as “other”.

Saying you’ll let people pick for themselves is still a judgement on them and an indirect propping up of you and quite like when someone says “I’m sorry to be offensive” when they know they’re going to be offensive. You know your beliefs aren’t ok with them.

I was raised Christian and am honestly an angry atheist now, so I don’t want to debate if you should be religious, but please don’t pretend Christianity can accept individual beliefs and expressions when practiced communally and, if your instincts are to be ok with someone enough to let them be and your beliefs are against that, give some thought to if your beliefs are worth it.
Definitely that.  That girl politics.
Exactly, we can't afford to turn away potential allies.
I do agree. She's the turning point... after her, the republican party has never been the same. They've become something I cannot get behind, and haven't been able to for a long time. I am honestly terrified for what's coming, but hopefully we persevere.
I would say she was preceded by Newt Gingrich in that, but she was a big ball of crazy.
Heck, I vote Dem and strongly considered McCain as Obama just didn't have a resume I felt was ready for President. But I just could not get around Palin. And Obama pleasantly surprised me.
This. I supported McCain in the primary on 2000 and would have voted for him in 2008 except for palin. With older candidates, I must consider the vp choice also.
Palin was the proto-Trump.  She demonstrated that insults and mean-spiritedness resonated with the Republican base far more than traits like competence,  experience, expertise, character etc. that we used to judge candidates on.

John McCain was someone who I had tremendous respect for, although I did not agree with him politically on most things.  His worst decision as a politician, IMO, was picking Palin.  to be his running mate.
The crazy started with Gingrich in the 90s, but you're right, Palin took it to a whole new level of weird.
> And I do believe she was the official entrance of bat sh!t crazy to the republican party.

Ah, but are you forgetting that frothy mixture of lube and fecal matter?
She was the reason I drifted away from the party, or at least what she represented.
I agree.  Honestly I was torn between Obama and McCain.  Which, looking back, was a wonderful, brief period.  Where I could see the country being run competently in either candidate’s hands.

But then he chose Palin.
If anybody ever “deserved” to be president it was McCain. And then he chose her. Omg.
Do you remember McCain's concession speech? The one where the McCain I wanted to run was back (and not the Republican tool he was in the campaign)?

A co-worker at the time pointed out to me Palin's behavior at the speech. It seemed like she was told "you will stand there and shut your damn mouth."
Just an incredible incredible fuck up on his part.
I think he saw which way the wind was blowing and was ahead of the curve with picking her. Not in a good way, but in a “I’m going to need this kind of appeal to the utterly batshit faction.”
They're not even in the same league. John McCain was the last of his kind. He would not like what has become of politics. He called people out for speaking poorly of his opponent. Today, they relish in it. It's scary.
Not that I regret Obama, but I feel that if McCain had selected *anybody* but Sarah fucking Palin, he would have done FAR better. She's where I parted ways with the party.
I didn't agree with many of his views but he was a decent man and a good person. I had so much respect for him when he confronted someone at a debate when they said that Obama was an "Arab" in a very non-complimentary way.
I lean right on a lot of things but I've hated most of the republican pres candidates in my lifetime. McCain is the only one I liked and respected but I wanted youth at that time so I went with Obama.
I haven't updated my registration since 1998, but it's time. My views no longer align with the republican party.
I never thought I would see the day where I would have a sliver of respect for Dick Fucking Cheney but here we are.  Cheney represented what used to be the worst about the Republican Party (everyone else can go fuck them selves so long as I got mine).   But that party has sunk to such new abyssal depths that even he is horrified.  

Conservatives should listen to him.  It seems that many self-described "conservatives" turned out (as I suspected all along) to be crypto-fascists.  But some actually truly believed in their stated philosophy and are willing to put country before party.  Even though I still disagree with them, they are true patriots.
But it’s not all. Several have broken rank. And that is telling in and of itself.
That is not true, I know in a few states there are some very large republicans for Harris groups, they are supporter her more because she is not Trump. Country before Party.
Correct, rotten the whole way down. Tacit support is still support.
A definitive Trump loss accompanied by Democrats reclaiming the House, and losing one or two prominent senators (ie: possibly Cruz and/or Hawley) could at least send the message that people are tired of their bullshit. Anything less than that and they'll probably continue trying to play Russian Roulette with the Constitution.
I've always thought this as well. I've told many people I'm shocked they haven't established the White Nationalist Party by now. I truly 100% in my heart thought it was going to happen.
Very well put. I have no problem with real Republicans but these Nazis have to go
Hello! Thank you for sharing your experience.
You’re too quick! I love that line.

I don't know why people keep saying this? Republicans have never really been fiscally conservative with the federal budget. This is a common misconception that has been debunked by economists for quite a while now.

[Relevant graph: deficit as a percentage of GDP by presidency](https://www.iedm.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figure1note032021_en.jpg)

Breakdown:

Reagan increased the deficit to ~5% until the end of his second term. 
HW Bush raised the deficit back to ~5%. 
Clinton gradually brought to a ~2% surplus by the end of his term. 
Bush cut taxes and brought deficit back up to ~5% before gradually balancing until the end of his term. 
Obama entered his term during a financial meltdown, increased deficit 10%, the economy recovered, many uninsured were provided access to health insurance, and he ended his second term at ~3% deficit. 
Trump brought us back to a 5% deficit until the pandemic.

She was the symptom of the turning point. It's a lot of the 24/7 talk radio conspiracy theories that brought us the tea party which morphed it to Maga.  

I really believe that these radio and TV personalities have recognized they can stay relevant and make money repeatedly making false claims and keeping their followers angry and scared.  Tucker is prime example.  Even though I disagreed with him, he was level headed back in the day   But now he is just a snake oil salesmen like trump. Unfortunately I think the same crap will continue even if trump loses.  GOP needs to reclaim their party and kick out the crazies.
I felt bad not voting for Candace Miller. If you have not left the party at this point, I have to question your fitness for any office.
The turning point was Nixon allying himself with Strom Thurmond. The influence was small, at first, but it silently spread until, like all cancers, the exponential growth started reflecting in exponentially more acute symptoms. Anti-choice, anti-civil rights, anti-education stances can all trace back to that. Without that, you don't get Fox News, the Moral Majority, Heritage Foundation, Newt's stonewalling, or Donald Fucking Trump.
It was the TEA Party that unlocked the looney bin
McCain is probably the only Republican I have ever had any respect for. His actions in Vietnam were insanely honourable and he acted with the same degree of honour and integrity throughout his whole life.
Ohh Santorum. God, I love Dan Savage.
Santorum takes the cake
It’s funny you say that because it’s pretty much the same for me. I think Palin was a rude awakening. Also, I started college around that time so I got out of my bubble and that probably also contributed to making me more liberal.
Same here. I voted for Bush Jr in 2000 (sorry everyone), Kerry in 2004 because I hated that we were lied to about Iraq and WMDs. I probably would have voted for McCain in 2008 if not for Palin. Voted for Obama twice, grudgingly voted for Hilary and Biden. Happily voted for Harris-Walz. 

I don’t see myself ever voting Republican again, but I do hope that Republicans get their shit together and stop nominating fascist fucks like Trump. We need a healthy two-party system and I am frankly irate that I have lost ten years of my life in a moderate state of panic in election run ups.
It was two things: the disastrous Palin pick and the weird choice to announce he was “suspending” his campaign in late September 2008 to go deal with the economic crisis. Both decisions felt like political theater and I think that really did him a huge disservice.
#1 reason I stopped even considering McCain.
I’m assuming you meant “christo-fascists”?
And they have all been forced out of office. While they were in office, they still went along with his agenda. Liz Cheney, for example. Look up how often she voted in line with Trump’s agenda. Same is true for any of them. Republicans have always been shit people. Trump just made them less ashamed to be open about it.
Yes,  "Several".  Not most, not many, but a depressingly small number.
True he really wants to throw everyone in jail, but also this is him assuming he can remove laws in place that would stop this. I also think the end goal is take over the courts. If you own the judges then it’s clear some of them will remain loyal which is so gross.
Thank you, Adjective-Noun-Number
Yeah, I agree. There's a lot of background, including the Tea Party. Palin really did normalize being a whack job in politics, though.
The turning point was, "all this stuff we've believed for decades and tried to do we can just say it out loud." The Republican party has been this for decades. Reagan and Nixon were mostly just more tactful. 

Trump is the natural end point of conservatism because that's what it is.
This was me, too. I would’ve voted for McCain if I’d been old enough to vote (just barely missed it). By 2012 I’d been in college for 3 years.
I think it was a third thing too: McCain did some untimely crowing about what a deregulator he was, at the exact moment that heavy deregulation cratered the economy in 2008.
I agree with both of those reasons for being turned off about voting for McCain in 2008. I remember that before the 2008 election I was undecided between McCain and Obama. But the tipping point for me was the day in September when McCain, during an interview, said that the US economy was still solid, and right after that statement the collapse of Lehman Brothers was announced. That gave me the impression that as a senator McCain was out of touch with what was happening in the country. Have voted democrat at the national level ever since.
What a mistake that was.
Hey! I resemble that remark!
This election is so wasteful 
This is one single days haul from the mail. I've been receiving this many mailers daily for nearly a month, and I'm sure it won't stop until the election ends. What a waste... how many dollars and resources have been spent on this garbage just for me to toss it when I walk in the door!?
BROOOO. i am tired of getting this everyday and the text, i blocked the numbers every time they text
I legitimately wish there was a way to opt-out from political mailers...or advertising mailers in general. In the last 10yrs, I've maybe used two coupons from those val-packs
I average 6 a day for the last month+. I have blocked at least 40 numbers from texting me in the last 2 months. And I ALMOST bought YouTube premium to avoid the stupid ads.

None of those are going to sway anyone. And it’s all an annoying waste.
As a mail carrier, I am counting the days until my trays are not filled to the brim with this crap.
Every day. What a disgusting waste of resources.
Yes it is! Millions/billions of dollars are wasted on the election that could have been used to improve the world, and also they are creating a ton of unnecessary physical waste to boot!
Recycle, recycle, recycle
I might be more happy to see political adds in my mailbox if I could wipe my butt with them.
I think this all needs to be wildly revamped. 

I voted the moment my ballot came in the mail on the 6th and haven't received Harris stuff ever since, but, I'm still getting a ton of Trump stuff and Trump's fake Harris stuff. 

It should be illegal to send political mailers other than a generic reminder to vote and all the candidates contribute to the one official mailer that gets sent to each area with their candidates and a quick blurb of what they think is the most important thing to know about them. That's it. A line or two each. The reminder to vote mailer goes out once a week only to those who haven't voted yet. It only gets mailed starting 6 weeks from the election. Otherwise you have to just use online/radio/tv and so on.
Candidates, PACs, and Special Interest Groups are wasting money on this shit

they are wasting money on the Staff that insist on this shit

they are wasting money on the Consultants that advise this shit

Think about that next time you send money to a Political Campaign.
You know, if these things were actually useful they wouldn't be so bad. Like say instead of basically an ad you get a letter from each candidate going over every policy, every change they want to make, and everything they believe in and support. Something that tells you exactly what they are about and why they're running for that particular position. That would be something I'd keep and read over. But nope! Just an ad like every other piece of junk mail I get.
That's what curbside recycling is for.
I use these to scrape up pet messes.
On a positive note, I would rather have a wasteful election than not have an election at all.
I have never been influenced by one of these for elections. I think they only work for those who don't get information any other way or for candidates without a large media presence.
I think it’s wasteful too but also I think of it this way…
There are lots of places where “campaigning” isn’t a thing. The winner is a foregone conclusion, and no one is trying to “win” your vote.

The price we pay for “choice”, the price we pay for being a swing state, is that lots of people are trying to break through the noise and, well, it’s a tough thing to break through so they do it through radio, tv, streaming, texting and yes, paper mail.
Every day. Straight to the recycling bin. You should see the number of unsolicited text messages and phone calls I get.....  

There should be a class action suit to make blowing up people's phones illegal.
I’m so sick of it, do people actually read that crap?
It's insane. I'm in Macomb county and I get 5-6 of these a day. Plus, door knockers leaving more in my front door. 

Please, I already voted. 

*leave me alone*
I feel that way every time I get my mail regardless of election cycles.

Anderson, please stop trying to get me to buy new windows every week. I don’t own the apartment complex ffs.
I get a ton of Michigan political mailers and I moved to Florida in 2017
Get rid of Citizens United!!!
My bf works for the post office and he’s sick of the political mail. He said it’s All it was yesterday.
As a mailman, I'm making a lot of ot for this crap. 64 hours a week for the last three weeks...
I voted absentee a couple weeks ago. All that is wasted money on me. 
Don't toss them! Collect them and use them for a collage!
My co-worker is from Mexico, he’s been getting them in Spanish. He’s been here over 30 years and speaks English so I wonder if they just assume by his name
We burn em. Toss em on the pile while walking in. 
I said the same as I was getting my mail yesterday. 

Instead of dropping all this trash in my mailbox, maybe figure out how to lower or eliminate my DTE bill and then I'll vote for you
Yup. All this money never goes to local communities. Just big businesses
For real… Who actually pulls this shit out of the box and says “oh damn, that changed my mind” 

So much wasted paper, ink, energy, etc… ugh.
Thanks to citizens United, rich people are able to donate practically unlimited funds to waste on this garbage 
To date, not one person has changed there vote based on mail flyers.  Not sure why they keep coming.
Mailman here. Believe me, I have not enjoyed all the extra work that I don’t get paid for because my route is based on evaluation. I’ve worked three hours for free this week.

Edit to add that all of these political mailers are third class mail that pay next to nothing to have them being delivered yet we give them even more special treatment than first class mail. Every single day every single piece must be delivered and we even have to make second trips if we have missed any at the office it is absolutely uncalled for.
We had 14 in our mail today. 14. We voted 2 weeks ago. It angers me so much. Such a waste of resources.
The boomers will die off and places will stop doing this
What ya do is save them….and when you get a self addressed stamped envelope, send it all to that place. I always do that with my junk mail.
Same goes for conservation non-profits sending 1/2 a forest in one envelope. I have 5 lifetime supply of return address labels.
This is what my dad does with those flyers. 

[Useless flyers](https://imgur.com/a/vfDhwEq)
Times are tough for the print industry, this put meals on tables. Just toss ‘em.
They all are. 

I've read other countries have laws restricting election season to 6 weeks of campaigning on free public tv

Damn that sounds good
In Michigan, my mail lady gives me the propaganda and it goes right in to the trash.
I tried to burn it and it doesn’t event burn well as a starter, makes fun colors though
More money to help keep the USPS in business. Silver linings.
I moved from Michigan to New Mexico 14 years ago and I actually got a handwritten postcard mailed to me last week from some political candidate in Michigan thanking me for voting. I think they are just looking for ways to spend money at this point
I'd pay 20$ to be able to opt out of all political mailers if it'd be better for the environment than just sending them to get recycled.
Hey, all that needless printing and PR spending is propping up our GDP.
I have put a metric ton of these, it seems, into my recycle bin without so much as glancing at them. 

And the text messages are so ridiculous. "You are the last data point we need to complete our pre-election research." Do you really think I'm *that* stupid? Throw in the sensationalized headings like "We are in tears," "Trump is crying right now," and the other nonsense and it's pretty easy to come to a conclusion that neither major party thinks any of us have a firing synapse in our heads.
How much money is the media making on this election. It seems almost every TV ad is political and the mail is nothing but a stack of political fliers which go directly in the trash.

IMO, the media is making bank on this election by continually fueling the fire of division
I've gotten the same junk mail, too. Every day, my mailbox is full. Is there a way to not get election mail sent over???
Unsolicited junk mail in general is wasteful.
Starting this with an "I'm from Maine" but. I've noticed this too. ALL from GOP candidates. Brainworm Bob also snuck some political ads into fortune cookies
voTe EArlY aNd THe CaLLs will SToP
Could feed a lot of hungry people with all the money wasted on stupid campaigning that nobody wants in the first place
Or profitable, depending on how you look at it.
They send us 2 of everything. We've never not been married in this house, ffs. get your shit together.
Folks complaining need to realize it is about getting out the votes and sometimes name recognition 

There are a number of low information voters who walk into the vote booth knowing almost nothing about the candidates or issues and will check a name they recognize 

But for the rest- the candidates are doing this to get people TO vote.  That's why the mailings, the door knocking and literature drops  , text messages and phone calls

We could have pushed for public financing of elections and banned private funding but when SCOTUS legalized corporations to help fund campaigns and super pac free rein this is the result
Meanwhile, in Texas

“Best I can do is voter suppression”
True, but it's absolutely nothing compared to the ways humans waste resources. Just think about one single military battle, compared to a warehouse full of paper.
Coming from an employee at a print/finishing shop, all this election mail has kept a lot of people working these last couple months so I’m not upset about it
Right like who actually reads these?
None of them even make it into my house. Mailbox right to the recycling bin
Imagine being a mailman!
All mine got recycled
Do you have a wood fireplace
It's every single election. I'm fairly confident election season single handedly keeps the USPS in business
For the mental health of the nation limits on length of campaign season should be established.  Shorten it up save money save our mental health
The hundred text messages I get a day is driving me nuts! I'm making Dr's appts, paying bills online, taking my kids trick or treating, I don't have time to drop everything and talk on the phone for a half hour......or just sit and say, "hello, hello" until I'm ready to throw my phone across the room because no one is on the other line. I voted the other way on one person just because of all the junk mail. Lol
Living in a swing state be like
Remember an election in Finland where instead of flyers they shared tissue packets, fresh fruit, snack bars etc and the candidates’ “flyer” was a sticker on the product.

Clever because 1. You will interact with that product (eat, use, drink etc.) which increases engagement with the information on the sticker. 2. They were convenient and aren’t just paper you toss away or roll in your bag forever 3. Less wasteful in producing more trash, instead of a small sticker was put on something that was already partially going to go to the trash.
Every election is wasteful.  And no one in history has changed their vote based on a name or slogan on a sign or flyer.  Or anyone that has changed their mind because of a yard sign on a strangers lawn shouldn't be allowed to vote because they lack the ability to make sound decisions and should be placed in the care of mental healthcare professionals.
[deleted]
60% plus of my mail is trashed unopened. Businesses are paying to send garbage to my door that I then pay to haul away. It’s horribly wasteful.
Never has anyone been politically persuaded by a mailer
Michigander. I've had Trump supporters come to my door asking who I'm voting for, only to spew derogatory remarks about America and it's people and how Trump will fix everything and make me rich. I get hateful, fear mongering flyers every day. I've gotten TWO Harris promotions, but I literally get something about Trump or "you're going to pay more of you don't vote for x" or gun violence stuff or "you should hate immigrants" in the mail or text messages every single day. And that's just me! Imagine the money and resources wasted.

I've never had this happen before, in terms of the spam and aggressive supporters and such. Make America Hate Again.
Anybody else getting these political texts at midnight? Or 5 AM?

There’s gotta be a way to stop this shit!
USPS carrier here…it’s worse than you can even imagine hahaha
I so wish everyone would just agree on publicly funded elections already. Each candidate has limited resources and has to use it wisely, not billionaire-funded campaign flyers and rampant wasting of grassroots campaign money collected on these goddamn swing state flyers and tv ads.
Just recycle it
*profitable.
It’s been crazy this year
It is. The printing companies must be doing well though.
Wonder what the environmental impact of these are. Not only making them all, but if every mailbox in the state averages 3 per day. How much extra weight is each USPS vehicle carrying and how much extra fuel are they using.
Right nobody reads those not even the under payed letter carrier that delivers them through rain,sleet, and snow.
My apartment complex keeps a garbage can right next to the neighborhood mailbox wall.  It's completely full of these things.
Are you kidding? I’m getting enough free kindling for bonfires to last all winter!
This is my first time living in a swing state during a major election. It's . . . different.
It makes good kindling
I saved most of what came to my house to burn tonight. Seems fitting
god i’ve blocked so many numbers and all of these have gone in our fire pit
Welcome to living in a swing state 😉
I'm collecting all of them, so I can see how many are for which candidate/party. I should count them up soon and do an analysis.

From what I'm seeing in Owosso, we're getting blanketed with insane mailings from conservative PACs, mostly. 

Most "attack ad" mailings I'm seeing are against Dem, Curtis Hertel. 

How's the distribution where other people are?
I got election mail from someone I can’t even vote for because they’re running for county commissioner in a different county.

Said county doesn’t even touch mine, and I’m in the heart of Kalamazoo so I have no idea how you’re that bad at campaigning.
At least this is all going through the Postal Service! Lol
My personal gripe with these is that I live in an apartment and have a tiny mailbox. Yesterday I had so many of these that the carrier left half my mail on top of the box. In that stack that was left out in the open was a replacement credit card that anyone could have grabbed.
Very single day for the past month I have received a trump propaganda card, and a Mike Rodgers one every few days
I'm sitting outside on my 2nd story patio yesterday and a man and woman walk up and knock on my door. I get up and walk over to the other side and look down to my door and ask them if I can help them. They ask if I'm registered and if I plan on voting. I see the material they're carrying and it's for the ticket that I plan on voting for. I don't like answering these questions regardless of party affiliation and I just wanted them to go away. So I told them it was all good, I planned on voting for the candidate they were pimping and the stack of flyers they wanted to give me wasn't necessary. I don't see how those things make any difference at all, at least to me, but they thanked me and before they walk off the lady leans down and slips the stack half under my door mat and then walks away. It's just wasteful.
I get that garbage too! Ugg Where can I report hate mail? Some weirdo is stalking me and puts flyers in my mailbox everyday.
If you vote early, you’ll be removed from mailing lists and lit drops.
This is exactly why I don’t donate money any more
Recycle
  The amount of money spend campaigning is just gross to me. Flying around from state to state, multiple states in a day? 

 I work full time and have had to wait hours in line at the food bank to feed my family of three.
Right! Also leaving stuff that I have to throw away/ gets blown into my yard. Can’t wait for this to be done with.
The political violence and aggression has really spiked during this election as well. There’s not even debates based on facts, just name calling the candidates without any reasonable explanation. “If ________ wins, it’ll be the end of our country.” But why? And I hear it from both sides.
My Dad lives in Ireland, I was telling him the amount of paper campaign stuff we get every day is crazy, I got 5 things yesterday, 4 more coming today
A couple of print companies made BANK though...
Agree. They all go right into the recycle
For real! How many fucking trees were killed to make all these stupid fliers? Can I sue on behalf of the trees? (/s)
On the bright side my puppy learned how to carry in the mail with all this daily junk.
They go straight from my mailbox to my recycle bin.
I think the establishment is afraid that we may all start thinking for ourselves and see that everything both sides do, is a sham. The left wing and right wing are still part of the same bird...
I have this thought like twice a week. I don’t even look at them just throw them out. Like don’t make me throw your trash away.
I was shredding a certain flyer but it can't handle that much bs.
In addition to my wife and I, we also have 3 college kids at home, so a total of 5 voting age people at one address. Every day our mailbox has 20+ political flyers. They don't even make it into the house, they all just get dropped into the burn barrel on the way back form the mailbox.
I’m gonna make some collages I think
I covered my entire kitchen table with all of the half page color ads I got. All but one were Kamala ads.
It has been a common occurrence at our house too. My poor mail carrier is sorting mail for more hours, and working late because of the sheer volume of these that have to be sent out. 

Its wasteful and unnecessary. Tuesday I had 11. 11 of these in my mailbox. 90% of the people receiving these are not undecided and the mailing will not make any difference. 

Also, more of us get our info online. I have to hope these go the way of the dinosaur in another 10 years or so as the boomers that refuse technology pass away. 

I can't believe nobody has came forward and said "rather than the mass junk mailings we took that budget and donated it to *insert local food bank*"

Because I feel like that is a far better use of funds.
My union has sent me a mailer at minimum of every other day for the last 6 weeks, and I am getting *beyond* irritated with it. I don't care if private campaign orgs want to waste their money, but goddammit quit spending my dues on this shit.
My running tally is 216. Only started keeping count in September. This is without the non partisan “vote, where you can vote, register to vote” ones added in. 

138 for Harris, 78 for Trump.
If you want to put them to use they make pretty decent firestarters.
There should be a QR code you scan after voting that gets rid of all the advertisements. A way to say "I've already cast my vote, please stop bombarding my socials and mailbox with ads!"
My recycling is full of them.
If it was pertinent useful and truthful information I wouldn't have an issue with it. 
At the end of it all I don't think I found a single thing in a flyer that was not misleading from either side.
I'm all honesty. This stuff is the reason postage is still as cheap as it is.
Yeh I got 10 ballots and papers like that in just one day.
The disinformation of the ads do affect people as you see youtubers go interview people on the street.  They recite the lies the ads say.
Wait till you hear what they spend your taxes on!
I was thinking the same thing. Not just how this money could be better spent, but the trees required! And the glossy colors. So costly.

And still asking for more money. For more pamphlets? TV spots (been muting these for six weeks now)?
Election season is annoying.  Constant commercials about it during sporting events.  Constant mailers.  Constant spam calls/texts.  Constant spamming on Reddit.  I can't imagine THAT many people actually change their mind about who to vote for based off any of this.
Various people in my neighborhood just throw them everywhere, my whole neighborhood is littered with these. My neighbor specifically throws ALL of them on the ground outside his mailbox. It's a mailbox pod in someone else's yard. Someone ultimately has to pick them up!(i have a totally disgruntled angry at the world retired neighbor, it sucks being next to him!)
I heard an ad for a bar in Kalamazoo that gives you a certain percent off for each one of these you toss in the shredder.  The day for the event is after the election.  I was just passing through, so I didn't catch the details.  Either way, it seems like a great way to recycle them.
Wait until you hear about car ownership and air travel 😜
I've been saving all the Kamala ones. Some memorabilia from the first female president would be kinda nice to have.
Does anyone make their voting decision based on glossy mailers?  If they do, they don't deserve to vote.
Our whole species is wasteful.
Yes it has been
 I have been keeping them. I have almost 200 and 135 of them are Democrat. This is for the month of October only.
Good fire starting material
Love how these doesn’t even really act as good fire starters either. If you are going to try and pander to me can you at least give me a good fire starter?
The non stop flyers. I have no trespassing signs on my property, and now a new no solicitors signpost right at the end of the driveway.

Political dipshits keep ignoring it. Well, actually, just the Republicans, for some reason. You think they would be interested in private property rights.
Please can it be over?
If a political flyer or ad decides how your going to vote you should lose the ability to vote.
They all are on so many spectrums
100% agree
No kidding love the ones coming from the green leaning candidates!!!
And someone is financially sponsoring it
I agree. And I’m getting so annoyed by all the election texts I get as well. They don’t even have the right name in them.
Maybe candidates should measure and report their carbon footprint?
\[cries in college promotional materials\]
You brought them _inside_?!
Package them and mail them back to the campaign.  See how they like it.
Direct mail and door handouts are a traditional means of promoting political positions. I have seen that my whole life.

Printers need the work. I know, I am a lithographer myself. Like coal miners we are a dying breed. We are always happy to see work come in.

Also, wood for paper is actually a crop, grown in managed forests. It is a renewable and usually recyclable.

We keep hearing about fundraisers for various candidates and the numbers raised can sometimes seem to be quite astonishing, we also get pestered for donations repeatedly. This is the kind of thing that money goes towards, this and radio and television (and buying off pundits and influencers).

To the recipient it can be terribly annoying. I get that. I hate it too, I hardly read any of it anymore ... straight into the recycle bin.
I was sent a survey which would’ve paid me $1 for every piece of political mail I received. Kicking myself in the ass now because I’d have a few hundo by now.
I just remind myself that they're paying the post office to deliver this stuff, so it helps them at least.
Every election seems to be wasteful. Oh, you mean the mailings! Sorry.
Print houses are the winners of this election.
It really is! Just ridiculous how many of those I get each day!
All kindling for a nice bonfire
The peak of hypocrisy. Let's spend millions of dollars to get you elected while you run on issues such as homelessness, hunger, and Healthcare. And by the way, if you do get elected you will suddenly be a millionaire.
If it makes you feel any better, many of the groups handing those out are recycling the ones that are left over. It’s not great though.
We need to revoke franking privilege, at least for mass campaigns like these. If these politicians actually had to pay USPS to send these we'd get less than half of these. It'll never happen because it only benefits the people who'd make the decision but it is what we need to help this problem.
have a fireplace? they make great firestarter..
All elections are like this.
I'm a letter carrier, thought I'd share my experience. First of all, we are all working overtime. Delivering this stuff adds so much work to our day. Hey, extra cash in our checks is nice, even though the work is annoying.

Second, we have to deliver them. Every one of these ads must be treated like they are the most important letter ever. Can't/didn't deliver one of these and bring it back to the Post Office at the end of your day? You better have a reason because management WILL be on your ass about it.
I was just saying this to my husband. They're preaching to the choir. I wish there was a way for campaigns to find out who they don't really need to send literature to.
I've received an insane amount of mail and text. My household has 5 voters (3 young adults) and we get probably 2-3x that per day.  I also live in a neighborhood where candidates constantly come to our door. It will be nice when the election is over.
Yes! I was just talking about this with my Mom. I bet about 98% of those things go straight into the trash without anyone ever looking at them. Use the money for all that high res glossy cardstock to do something useful.
Same thing here in Colorado.
Paid adds for elections that should be based on merit… not what our forefathers had in mind me thinks. (You’re doing it wrong, palm face.)
If you think this is bad, lets start talking about coupons.
I want to get paid for receiving political bullshit
Also, who the fuck are these people 😭😭😭😂 that’s what I ask myself before I shred them
Capitalism is wasteful
I don’t even bring them in the house anymore.  I don’t read them, just swing by the recycling bin and toss them in on my way in.  Such a waste.
I probably printed some of that, I'm sorry. If it makes you feel any better we really fuckin hate it too.
I throw them in recycle bin.
I am not in Michigan but I chimed in to agree because I don’t live in a swing state but still get them.
I got a campaign ad text while reading this comment sections lmao
In 2020, we gathered all the election stuff from the mail and recycled it to make little fire starter disks for camping. We made so many we had to give some away.
I been stacking all of the ones we receive to ask them how the green movement has been going when the election is finished. It seems they forgot about the environment
America needs to take a leaf out of the UKs book. Election gets announced then its all done in 6 weeks.   I don't know how you all cope with it going on for years and years , it's wearying even as a foreigner I can't imagine what it's like over there.
It's better than text messages. They just go into my big recycling bin, and I only check the mailbox once a week or so anyway. I get a lot of texts for work, so I have to check them promptly, and the junk ones just break my concentration.
I just threw everything in your hand away
We get the same here in Georgia.  Pounds of paper go directly from the mailbox to the recycle bin.
Junk mail in general is a huge problem, unfortunately it's the only thing keeping the postal service running. 62% of all mail is junk mail.
I looked it up. If we as a nation took all the money from political campaigning and instead added it to the education budget it would be a 30% increase in the budget. Something like 18 billion dollars we spend on campaigning… ya know instead of fixing actual problems
You know this stops when you go to vote
The people manufacturing those don’t think so. But it is def a waste of paper
So I was told if you go ahead and vote, the mailings, calls, and texting will stop.  Supposedly they have all this high tech data collection to stop it?  Not true for you?  After I voted it stopped pretty much.  LMK what your experience is. TY
Next election I’m mailing them all back in one big envelope
I throw them out every day….without even looking at them. Total waste of resources.
I use them to line the bottom of our bird cage, and it's a game to us to see whose head he poops on. Next election season, y'all might post up on a buy nothing group and see if anyone wants yours to use for that, if you're willing to save some up.
Got to find some way to light that $16B in campaign spending on fire.
What's really wasteful is that 80% of that is garbage spewed by PACs and not the candidate.
22 in the mail yesterday, and everyone in the home has already voted!
In every way imaginable
I think they all are wasteful.
Unfortunately it’s still the most cost effective advertising method and studies show they work and can move the needle a few percentage points. Trust me, we hate building them and stuffing them. But if our side stops and the other side doesn’t we’re not going to remain competitive.
I hate that I don't live in a swing state because my vote for POTUS is meaningless. The state is going for Trump. But at least I get spared all the advertising.
Every day I check the mail here in CO, 3-6 new ads get tossed in the bin.
This is the proof that NO politician really cares about the environment.
I have a special trashcan just for mine. They don't even make it in the house.
This is why I'll never donate to any campaign. All they do is spend it on stupid shit like this
They all are. Think of how much better money could be spent on programs and things they say they’ll do but never happens.
It’s been crazy this election cycle with the mail flyers. We use them to light our woodstove!
In many many ways….
Maybe it worked on boomers but I’ve never even looked at a flyer I get in the mail, and I don’t think they’re effective at sending information or changing opinions these days. It’s entirely a waste of paper and ink to me.
My dad says that after the election he's gonna make a tree with all the mailers hes got and put it in his front yard.
Fiat games. Can't wait for people to wake up.
lol. You think it’s wasteful now, just wait until the winner is declared 🤣

Regardless the outcome, the ensuing nonsense will be unimaginable.
I'm registered as non party affiliated. The amount of junk mail about politicians that I have been receiving in the past few months is astronomical. The amount of political text messages I get daily is insane (thank God my new cellphone has this new feature I can just block and report this nonsense, but the list I have block is miles long). I subscribed to YouTube Premium during the last election when I got fed up with the commercials, and I still subscribe to enjoy content without the damn commercials. I'm staying out of town this week for work, and I tried to watch TV at the hotel, I counted 12 political ads back to back in between the show I intended to watch. I turned the TV off and just watched YouTube on my phone. Can't wait for this to be over!
If congress allowed the Post Office to raise rates on bulk mail, we wouldn’t have this problem.
I have 4 registered voters in my household, none of us are registered to the republican party, and yet both parties lately, more so the Republicans, have put nearly 6-8 diffrent fliers saturated with fear porn and largely bias/partly-untrue statements its an average of 28 flyers per mail delivery every day, at this time of the year. They arnt even considering the valuable real-estate this consumes for a mail carrier. 

That takes up space for medical supplies and other needs headed south and our wants and needs headed to rual areas. It wastes the postal services time, and serves no real enticement for me as a voter to want to pick them because I consider these factors. (Not that their Trump endorcement would have done them any favors alone)
Sure is, I've gotten tons of these flyers even after I voted early! I just shred the address and throw the other half in the trash.
Fuck direct mail advertising in general. Over half of the mail I get goes straight in the trash.
I just don’t get it. A text message, a mail in flyer, or an attack add has never changed my political views. Why do we put ourselves through this every 4 years? How much do the candidates spend? Probably enough to do some actual good around the country lol
I receive nothing but Harris mailers. 

It's obnoxious.
Just wasting trees with their gross lies and manipulation
Yes!!!!!!   Hate this part with a PASSION!!!!   None get read, all get put in trash!!!!
Funding for the USPS! If it weren't for junk mail, we may not still have the postal service. Otherwise, yes wasteful..
Not as wasteful as phone books.
Yeah, well have you checked out r/fucklawns ?
Unfortunately, it’s the same thing in Ohio 🙄

Such a waste of time/ money / resources
I live in a Blue non-swing state, but used to live in Georgia. The amount of election spam my wife and I get for both our state and from Georgia is ridiculous.
I’m getting so many texts and leaflets I want to be like I’M VOTING FOR HARRIS ONE ELECTION DAY, CAN YALL STOP HOUNDING ME ABOUT IT
They all are
Yes!   We can’t help fix the homeless problem but they can waste money on this crap.    Who do they think changes their vote over a mailer?
Don't worry, cronies are getting paid. This is Black Friday for partisan print shops
Maybe we should vote to change that, see if it actually changes anything.
The people that win get to be in charge of literally billions of dollars. A few pieces of paper are nothing in the grand scheme.
This is what happens when you select an affiliation and make political donations.
Your mail carrier hates it even more
I keep looking for a way to upcycle them into something useful
![gif](giphy|FaJnsNeceNlFq7kFx5|downsized)
I was just thinking about this. What happens at these companies after the election? Do they lay people off and downsize? Also, what happens when all the advertising on radio/tv dries up? It has to be a drastic drop from one day to another. I have so many questions
Not if you own a fire pit. That crap is great for starting fires. 🔥
Junk mail is keeping our USPS in business!
The only upside is that I have a microcut shredder and now have tons of colorful confetti for New Year’s Eve.
Imagine if they used the money they waste on these mailers to solve actual problems...... 🤔🤔🤔
Great fire starters for my wood stove.
Every day I'm getting crap like this in the mail.
As a Canadian that lives close to the border, is inundated with US news, works with team members who are in tbe USA, and I keep track of political news around the world, why is your election cycle 2+ years long?

It's 2024, not the early 1800s, when candidates had to stump around the country on the back of a railroad coach!

In Canada, when an election is called, the election day has to be within 54 days.

We don't spend years and many millions and millions of dollars endlessly spouting their virtues and why we should pick them. 

It's like going to Costco, get in, get out, quit fucking about!

Get on with governing ready.
We need legislation to end this nonsense. I’m seeing in comments that even mail carriers are sick of this, and for some reason that never crossed my mind. What can we actually do to stop this? Anyone want to try to form a plan? I went the route of trying to tell each one to quit, only to realize they’re coming from dozens and dozens of places…
Snail mail in general is wasteful. Yes, there are still legitimate, necessary cases (rural and other areas which may not have modern infrastructure, explicitly requested physical goods, etc) but in general, I honestly think any and all kinds of junk mail like this shit should be illegal and severely punished.
I get an average of 3-5 a day in Oakland Co. The ones about menthols are hilarious though. Is anyone really deciding their vote on a threat to menthol cigarettes?
I get 12 a week. From SISTERS competing for the same local office. They are fucking ruthless. One sister posted pictures of her sisters DUI arrest while the other one posted her sister crying when her husband left her for another woman. 

I throw them out in the mailroom but I'll try and find them to share photos... It's a disaster but I'm always eager to see more family dirt.
You have interesting priorities.

  
This will decide your future, but a few leaflets bothers you more?
Just fyi, if you have early voting available in your area I would suggest voting as soon as possible. They buy voter rolls every other day and widdle the list down by eliminating people who have already voted. So if you early vote you will stop getting mailers and texts because they don't waste money sending out materials and texts to people who have already voted.
Another reason for hating politics
Try being the one delivering all that shit and then going home to more
Swing state problems
From the mailbox to the recycling bucket.
This election is funding the USPS* lol
If only there were adblock for life
Compost
I keep receiving ads for candidates in Wisconsin.

I live in Minnesota.
This is why I get so frustrated at the constant barrage of texts and emails asking for money only for them to use my donations…to pay to send flyers back to me.
Printers. Delivery people. Binderies. Paper suppliers. Ink Suppliers. Printer repair guys and others all have jobs because of what you are holding. And it is happening nationwide. The economy is the best it has has ever been. Corporations are raking in record profits. These are the “Good Years” enjoy them while they last.
Clearly the government...as in all the candidates don't understand the best use of funds. 
It's astonishing the amount of money that is raised and used in these campaigns to run for office in FREE world. 
We could come up with infinite possibilities for all those funds. Imagine what our economy could accomplish if we (to include the politicians) actually spent the money in useful ways to help better our nation. 
It doesn't matter what side, team you're on.  We are SUPPOSED to be ONE Nation! Let's get back to that. 
Let's raise that kind of money for our homeless, to repair our metal health crisis, which we are suffering from.
Bad as that is try voting so that you at least have a government, couple of places you can go with no adds, Russia
Most of these are from Republicans who don't mind wasting money and resources
Yeah, I’ve gotten some for me, My mom, and my brothers for the past month or two it’s been obnoxious
That’s absolutely true.
It is here too in Pa. We get that many about every other day.
I get a handful like this every single day and it all goes directly into the recycle bin. I feel sorry for the mailman who has to sort this shit and deliver it to every single home.
Hey, junk mail put a roof over our heads and food on the table for many years.  Think of it as a jobs program.
Those handouts are a complete waste for the people that are gonna just fill in one bubble and vote party instead of individual.

It’s way too much stuff to memorize. (this person is good for this and that person is bad for that)
This election? Every single election is a waste I got 12 flyers from the same candidate in one week
The trash can beside my neighborhood mailboxes overflow with this shit.  It's a waste of perfectly good trees.
I’m on the Wyoming/Grandville border and I had 11 of them in my box yesterday. 11!
It creates jobs!
Sometimes I wish I had a fireplace just so I could use all the waste paper I receive as firestarters.
Increase the postage costs of all political mailers by 500%.
Thank your mail carrier.  One of the most difficult times of this year (besides Christmas) is political season.  They get bundles of "full coverage" political mail and are forced to deliver. 

Even if a bundle comes in late on November 5th, they'll be sent back it to deliver.
Free kindling
I just treat it the same way as any other advert. The more ads I see for something, the less likely chance I am to buy that product
They use that thicccc paper too. What a waste
I seriously thought of putting a small trash can by our mailbox with a note for all political crap here
Pro tip;  Whenever you vote almost all political ads will soon stop.  I voted on the second early day.

I guess OP hasn’t voted yet?
Imagine how great the world would be if we took all the money spent in politics and just spent it on the actual problems they are claiming to want to solve.

Like instead of spending billions on ads asking me to vote for you so you cannot spend billions of my tax dollars just spend your own money to fix the problem and leave me out of it.
On the plus side, republicans are finally funding the post office some.
Agree
1.6B reported so far, but likely to more than double once all FEC reporting is completed. That money has to go somewhere, but can’t pay directly for votes so… I’d rather have an even share of the likely 5+ billion, about $14.89 per citizen
This country needs election finance reforms and a time restriction on when you can start campaigning.
still getting them after i voted too 😐
They go straight from my mailbox into my recycling bin. I don’t even read them.
![gif](giphy|Yao9rHOMX4uD81V3Lb)

My thoughts on politics, period.
No. It’s the most important election that I can remember in decades.
It’s possible that the trees that are being killed to print all of the material for the election is a wasteful use of paper
Straight to my burn barrel.
The clutter of democracy
It's the American way, Baby!
It’s ok. We can use them for fire fuel during the upcoming troubled times.
Something I plan to start doing is saving all my paper waste, wait til the end of the year and have a little bonfire. Not necessarily celebrating the new year but as a therapeutic way to move forward and just try to keep moving. 

And all this election paper waste will be reflective of that year.
i voted for a different state assembly elect out of spite of having to see signs for the incumbent 

state assembly means nothing so i can protest vote
Paper can be recycled at least. It's the annoying, lying, accusatory PAC TV ads that can't be thrown away.
Same, I feel like I've blocked 500 numbers by now! It's been absolutely insane!
[deleted]
I delete n report as spam!🤣🤣
They use a system which assigns a random number when you call, nobody is using their personal phones. Blocking the number doesn’t do anything.
And some of them are fake from the other side
Google messaging app has saved me in this department. Auto blocks all the spam and the more you report the better detection it is for everyone using it. I've been getting like 20 a day and maybe 1 or 2 slip through every few days
The texts are going to drive me insane
I live abroad but I use roaming, the amount of texts I wake up to every day is insane. The more I block, the more texts I get.
But that's not waste except for the millivolts. The paper waste is the problem. I already voted and still get tons oh this crap. 

Post Office could easily end junk mail and millions of tons of waste.
Every damn Ad too! Like bro i go to sleep with ptsd knowing Alissa Slotkin’s name.
“Report Junk.”

Every text. Every time.
Couldn't agree more. I use them as fire starters, but honestly I have so many saved up that I've just been walking straight from the mailbox to the recycling bin.
You CAN opt-out of val paks. I did that and tried to with as much other junk as I could since all my bills and what not are all e-delivery or autopay.  Val-pak opt out: [https://www.valpak.com/remove-address](https://www.valpak.com/remove-address) Also, opt out of prescreened credit offers: [https://www.optoutprescreen.com/](https://www.optoutprescreen.com/) Both were the bulk of my junk mail until i did that.
Val-Paks were valuable as scrap note paper when they were printed single side only. 

(Insert 'member berries here)
Vote as early as possible, it cuts down on almost all mailers, calls, and door knocks. Within a week or two, the campaigns know your vote is locked in and submitted, so you're a waste of resources to reach out to.
There is.

For credit cards

And don't forget your cell phone


www.donotcall.gov


DMAChoice and DoNotCall will eliminate direct mail and call/txt both political and non-political.


Assuming they follow the law that is
I’m not voting differently because of the ads, but I definitely think less of many candidates. Especially the texts asking for money while mentioning how hard it is to make ends meet. I’m not giving you money just so you can buy more ads to pester me with.
>And I ALMOST bought YouTube premium to avoid the stupid ads.


I use Firefox and installed the UBlock Origin extension, and it seems to work for all the youtube ads so far.
Just think of the number of people who have upgraded to the commercial free plans and realize it's all part of the plan. You tube and other companies are making so much money from all of it.
> None of those are going to sway anyone

It's not about swaying votes usually, most of elections are about getting your voters to the polls or getting your opponents voters to stay home

Also the damage to the planet from a trump win far outweighs these mailers
Unblock origin and Revanced
Don't give YT your money...

Use a browser that accepts uBlock Origin.

I haven't seen an ad on YT in a few years.

E: Spelling
You know it's bad when you think of paying for YouTube premium
Especially this last week, ads from the rbg super pac are unhinged and cringe to listen.
It really is insane. I've had the same number for almost 2 decades. The amount of numbers I have blocked from political byllshit alone from all the past elections is concerning. 

Plus, the number was originally attached to my ultra Maga dad's account when I was in high school so that's not helping me.
I keep seeing an old man saying Kamala is using tax payer funds for illegal immigrants in prison to have a sex change operation.  Their ads are just buzzwords.  It’s wild. 


I have a huge stack of mail almost every single one of them are republican.  It’s getting to be too much
Speak for yourself. After throwing away 3,000 pieces of mail, the 3,001st piece really made me rethink everything
I swear I thought it was just me getting that about of them. 2-6 a day now for the past month, 95% pro Trump. Every time I open Informed Delivery, it's just more of them.
Imagine NOT living in a swing state.  I've never seen a presidential rally, speech, and maybe 1 or 2 ads in the year. They NEVER come here. They never ask what we need. They never even think about us or try to win our votes directly.
YouTube premium is so worth it tbh you should go for it. I haven’t heard an add for months and it’s amazing. It comes with YouTube music too.
I bought an Onn streaming device and sideloaded SmartTube. No more ads on my TV when watching YouTube. I guess Google still wins in the end because it runs AndroidTV, but at least it's not a subscription.
they say if you vote early they'll stop.   vote twice. 
that asshatt Brandon Williams put a sign in my yard without permission. I'll vote twice against him. sucks to suck Brandon Williams
And none of them swayed anyone's vote one inch.
YouTube premium got me. I couldn’t take it anymore.
You know it’s bad when you actually seriously consider buying YouTube Premium
Ublock origin on Firefox kills all your YouTube ads, regardless of what candidate you're voting for.
Google got me, paid for premium and it has been a blissful experience opposed to… non premium.
I don’t even glance at them. They go straight into the trash based on size alone.
YouTube premium is amazing and it should be purchased (especially if you're a student since it's $8 a month)
YouTube Premium is the one single streaming service that’s worth paying for to avoid ads since I use it quite often to hop aroma videos, watch and listen to music videos, etc.
Believe it or not, the mailers and the ads do work. They do sway people. They sway the people who are not like you and me and don’t ever think about politics or voting or anything. There’s no way for campaigns to know who is who so they send them to everyone.
I work downtown. Having 4-6 pieces of political for every stop makes me crave the sweet release of death.
My brother is a carrier and he said the political mail is killing him.
Bless your heart. They’re so hard to deliver too because they stick together and they’re so heavy. Anddd you have to stop at literally every house.
Thank the supreme court's citizens united decision.
Our mail carriers told us they’ve been hitting overtime because they have to deliver so many of these. I guess it’s good business for USPS but it’s so wasteful.
We mail carriers hate it just as much as our customers. Takes so much extra time and effort to deliver all this crap and I literally watch people take it from me and walk it to the garbage can. 

Such a waste of time money energy resources and trees
The signs, the conventions, the travel, all the people’s work and resources to make the money to give away as donations, all up in smoke every couple years
It's why I refuse to donate to *any* candidate.  You want me to piss away my hard earned money to get you a job, meanwhile funding all sorts of advertising I actively despise?  No thanks!
It's kinda loony toons how candidates at nearly every level of office complain about how expensive campaigning has become, when they're the ones paying to postage actual waste (that we won't even look at) to us.
This is why many countries limit campaigning to specific, short periods and only using public funding. It greatly reduces chances of corporations and oligarchs buying elections.
Most of the ads being mailed out are non-recyclable.
Or also good fire starters :)
Recycle is the last chance effort. As a humanity the first step is reduce, what we physically can’t reduce we should try to reuse (either as its original form or for something different). Then if neither of those are possible we should recycle. Everything connected to a campaign is just wasteful and shouldn’t exist, part of the issue is there’s a minimum amount these parties HAVE to spend.
R E D U C E
The only one stopping you is you
The in my area R’s seem to be working off outdated lists with paid canvassers.

 MDPs lists are being updated daily to knock off early voters.
I like your blanket ban idea on spam mail. I'm a MI Japan expat, and Japan just had elections last week, we got zero mail, and the active campaign season was only a month or two- I doubt the US could ever get that short, but the length of Harris' campaign, say 3\~4 months, plus a quick primary seems more than enough.
[deleted]
I going to keep it real, I often wonder if "small dollar donations" matter in the long run, because it appears the politicians only heed what the "large dollar donators" say to them.
One of the wonderful side effects of corporations being people and money being speech.
THIS!
Presidential Brewing will give you 1% off a beer for each of these you bring in on Election Day.
My apartment complex doesn’t do recycling
Unless your garbage company is complete trash like mine is, and has been occasionally picking up the recycling with the same truck as the garbage.
Same
[deleted]
This is irrelevant to the post. Ads like these aren't a requirement for functional democracies, it is just a way for people to make money and contribute to destruction of the climate. No use of having an election if the earth isn't habitable.
I hear you, but I'm in a county that went 70% for Trump. There is no point sending me 10 Trump mailers a day when I already voted. The only reason I can think of for it is to intentionally bog down the mail service to try to impede the mailing of absentee ballots. The county I'm in is going to go for Trump again. There is no reason for me to get 10 mailers a day.
I got 12 texts and 1 call yesterday, Blocked them all and moved on, but damn, it's like ... I already voted FFS, leave me alone.
boomers
I heard my mailman complaining to either someone on a headset or just outburst that he was sick of all the stupid ads. It made me kinda giggle.
My collage making days are long gone... they're kindling now
I cut out the candidate's pictures from them and hid them in my parents house as a prank everytime I visited this month
I donated once to ducks unlimited and arbor day foundation. Now I get multiple letters per day from non profits asking for money. I got a massive one today where veterans of foreign wars sent me some shitty pens, Christmas cards, and a check for $2.50. I just want it to stop.
LOL, we do the same thing! https://imgur.com/gallery/kids-were-having-fun-with-political-ads-we-get-mail-pdcJvZh
That does not take away from the fact that this is so wasteful.
Your not wrong but I do wish they'd use different materials because a lot of these are no recyclables and none of them are biodegradable.
Hadn't considered it from this perspective...
Same keeps getting said of the coal industry. We dont need to make things for the sole purpose of employment
Also gotta believe this helps USPS
Glossy paper has clay filler in it to:

1. Reduce costs. Pulp is more expensive than clay so clay is added as a filler so the paper uses less pulp.
2. Brighten the raw paper. The clay has a static brightness so you need less bleach to brighten the pulp.
3. Helps with polishing the paper.

Glossy paper can be made of up to 40% clay and clay doesn't burn. The funny colours were likely due to the inks, though.
Right. They go from mailbox down on the street into the garage garbage can w/other unopened spam. Never make it inside.
At this point, I almost welcome back the scammers and telemarketers.

......almost
I haven’t blocked any. They use a different number every time. And it’s just a text…
The calls are insane; I don’t recall getting a fraction of these calls in past elections.
I love how they all end with “STOP to end” and I could reply stop, but instead I say something nasty and occasionally they will say “you have unsubscribed” and it always gives me a kick.
My brother just voted for Trump so...+1 fuckbag unfortunately 
I do the same, does that eventually help at al?
thank you!! i just started doing that.
The colors those things make in fires makes me wonder about the chemicals I’m burning off though. Wish they just wouldn’t send them at all
I park my recycle bin next to the mailbox right now.  Straight out of one and into the other.
Here's the thing - I opted out of ValPak, but my mail carrier doesn't care to read the actual address on the 20+ ValPak's he's stuffing into the shared mail boxes.....so I still frequently end up with my neighbor's copy!

The John James ad about how the US “used to have a border” shows you how far these campaigns have devolved. It’s an obvious scare tactic. That and really anything about sex changes for inmates or illegals. 

I’m a West Point grad too. And I voted for him in the last election. But all this braindead fear-mongering made me lose every bit of respect I had for the man.
I just assume any politically affiliated texts are bots or scams and ignore/delete all of them. The sheer number of them, though, are ridiculous
Funnily enough I am voting differently because of the ads, but not the way the ad sender had hoped. For the school district where I'm at, admittedly, I did very basic research for somethings, but probably not as much as I should have. And this one lady was listed as "school board member" and the opponent was "marine biologist and mother" and I'm like, well, I figure the person who is on the school board already knows better?

  
I had already filled my ballot out but hadn't sent it yet, and then one day a page comes in for the school board lady, and my god. She had an extremely obviously photoshopped picture of herself looking professional, with a picture of her opponent, which was a screenshot from a tiktok video I guess, but with a grainy filter applied to it to make her look bad and unflattering. And then in it, went over all the things the school board lady was and what the marine biologist wasn't. Also went on about how the school board lady supports essentially outing kids sexuality to their parents and not giving them any privacy, that shes a republican, and so on. 

  
And so I was like, ok, time to do some research on this lady, and turns out, she is apparently one of the dirtiest, conniving pieces of shit I've seen. 

  
Needless to say, she paid some sort of money to essentially lose a vote which was infinitely funny to me. Had she kept her stupid mouth shut, or rather, not been some dirty politician type, I would have voted for her, so thank god she did put that out, lol.

  
Granted its only my one vote, and the area I'm in is, predominately republican leaning, so it probably gained her more than it lost, but its like, I really hope this lady looses, when I wasn't super invested before.
WE'RE AT 49% IN MICHIGAN! IF YOU COULD SEND US JUST $40 WE COULD WIN!

I get these all the freaking time. I voted for the candidate in question here but my experience with this party is that I made a one-time donation to Pete Buttigieg and Act Blue \*swears\* they don't sell my info but damnit, since then I've been deluged. 

(no, I don't hold Pete responsible but I've never donated via Act Blue again.)
However, I would be open to paying ActBlue’s fees *and* tipping you an additional $5 to REMOVE ME FROM YOUR MAILING LISTS

But candidates aren’t allowed to coordinate with PACs so they couldn’t remove me from all the mailing lists.  Phhooey/
Both president candidates have big corporations / the richest man on the planet backing them. They don’t need my $5 🤣
I've been using UBlock Origin for years. Couldn't use the web without it.
This is the way
Sponsorblock and dearrow are also free and fun.
I’m sure that’s part of it. YouTube probably welcomed all the dark money to push the ads too. So they’re just living the dream by double dipping in it all.
Oh man, the other day I used my wife's computer for the first time in a long while and it was like "what is this unuseable hellscape?"


She insisted that it was fine, I rebutted that I could fix it for the foreseeable future within the span of one add, and did that.
What browser you use?
Opera GX 
works as well still mostly
YT Premium family plan is where it is at. Find friends or family and split up to 6 ways. Get youtube without adds and Youtube Music for everyday use.
I truly don't get the hate for youtube premium.

There are costs to running the platform. I like the content, and I'm happy to pay a reasonable price for it. 

There are far shittier services that cost way more and have less content.
I always get downvoted to hell on Reddit when I say that I actually like YT premium lol  

"Why no Vanced or uBlock?"  

Because I'm a lazy mfer
Huh, I didn't know they had a student discount. If I used Youtube more ofted, I would totally utilize that.
Plus it comes with YT Music., saved $12 dropping Spotify.  It's the only service stay subbed to year around 
Hang in there lol
Can confirm this guy is a mail carrier
I feel so bad for my mail carrier. Addressed to me, addressed to wife, addressed to both, addressed to household, addressed to current residents, addressed to voter, addressed to me or wife.... literally like 5 per day, usually multiple copies of the same thing
I used to consider doing it years ago, but now I definitely wouldn’t, especially to any state or federal/national campaign. The political game at that level is so dirty and I doubt anyone gets/stays there cleanly anymore. My money is much better donated to *reputable* causes/organizations.
Especially when 99% of the time what they are sending out tells you NOTHING about their platform, beliefs, or potential policies. It’s usually just their name, some endorsements that mean 💩 to me, a slogan, a posed picture, and possibly/probably some slander against their opponent.
Why/how?? I've been throwing all mine in the recycle bin
Ah, sheesh.  And all this time I thought I was doing a good thing for the universe by tossing my handful of mail ads right in the recycle bin.
Nah these are covered in plastic so they don't get wet when people shove them in your door cracks.
The length of Harris's campaign was so refreshing compared with past elections.
I only ever got a couple Harris ones. I just get buckets of Trump stuff. You almost wonder if he's sending so many to sabotage mailed ballots and slow the process. Just overwhelming the system intentionally because he knows more of his opponents voters use vote by mail.
or keep it local where your small donation might carry more weight.
Basically free beer in any swing state
Well, now I'm officially selling these for 1/2 the cost of a Presidential Brewing beer!!! 😆

Edit: Ah, initially it was a beer per... looks like I'll have to go back to burning them
So if I bring in all the ones I've gotten, they'll pay me to drink?
The city I live in totally shut down its recycling program.
I don’t read a single one. Straight into recycling.
I work in marketing, and last we checked the response rate for these is something like 2%-4%. It's an absolute waste of time, effort, and resources. Someone made a comment about this employing folks, but it's the same stuff that ends up making everything that comes in packaging cost more.
I like to read the GOP mailers and follow their sources to see what they’re twisting. 

My very favorite was “DEMOCRAT ATTORNEY GENERAL ACCUSES DEMOCRAT MICHIGAN HOUSE OF CORRUPTION”, citing a paywalled article. 

Bypassing the paywall, they weren’t lying. 

Democratic AG Dana Nessel accused specific Republicans in the Democratic-majority house of embezzlement and other crimes.
99% of these are just wasteful and useless, but I am actually very glad that I received one in particular,  because it broke down the beliefs of some of the state Supreme Court justice candidates, whom I knew nothing about previously, and helped me to actually make an informed decision. Mind you, that was one out of dozens or possibly hundreds
The 10 seconds it takes me to rip the right wing ones into pieces does give me a tiny bit of stress relief and I'll take whatever I can get these days lol
I do wish once you voted they would take you off the mailing lists. And…I’m told they do but my mailbox begs to differ.
I think it would be a good GOTV campaign. “Hey if you vote early , you won’t get any more mail / texts / calls!”
They can’t all be that gullible

There are also other people in this world who actually read these and rely on them for information. This website skews so young and terminally online that it forgets how many voters are older, rural, and not online 100% of their day.

I try not to judge what people decide to do with their bodies, but I do think those issues are the least of the problems our country is facing.

Not that one, the one calling carel marlinga "pedo protector"
Comments like this are so bizarre - of course YouTube accepts ad money, that’s incredibly public, and of course they benefit from subscribers who buy premium to avoid ads. That’s their entire business model.

You come up with this conspiracy that they’re welcoming “dark money”, and then get upset about it. It’s not that deep, they’re a business that runs on ads and subscribers.
Firefox
The hate comes from people that don’t think you should be paying for it. I had a guy in another thread comment to “please stop giving them money” and do it “this way”, then told me what programs and whatnot to use.

I’m not comfortable with that. I’m not that savvy with tech and it’s much more reasonable for me to pay for a measly *two* months of premium. 

He got upset with me when I said I wasn’t going to do that, as if his way was the *only* way. No, his way works *for him*. And paying for 2 months only, works for me. 

I have no idea why it matters so much to them, but it does.
I also watch youtube on my tv, and while I could setup a pie hole, youtube tv is actually reasonably priced for how much I use it.
[deleted]
> "Why no Vanced or uBlock?" 

It also really isn't an option when watching on a TV, which is where I personally watch YT 95% of the time.
I think it's the gloss print. They would have to use just card stock for it to be recyclable. 

Perfectly doable but it wouldn't look as nice and it would be less rain resistant
Its okay they pull it out at the recycling center, so you're actually a job creator by doing that.
Which we deserve for the bombardment of political nonsense
I read them as I walk to the recycle bin. I've gotten laughs out of them for sure lol "who the fuck would be swayed by these?"
2-4% would make a huge difference in this election. I hope that isn't the case, but i have a feeling it will.  Even 1% could be enough.

Thing is, the right wing latching on to that reinforces that Nessel puts state and country over party and affiliation.  It's actually a notch in her belt that she doesn't play politics.

Basically, they're advertising for her and don't realize it's not the gotcha moment they think it is.
That was one of the 3 I saved for my roommate. I saved the vote411 card and local issue ones, also.
Of course not "all" of them, but a disproportionate amount compared to your average person
which is why there are STILL undecided voters somehow.

  
Because this is where they get 100% of their "information"
The point is blocking them doesn't do anything but waste your time
Upvoted for mitch.
We could take all the shit they've sent us in the mail and stack it all up to create an entire southern border wall. We'll get the north done next cycle.
I think it’d be really cool if everyone that wanted to transition could, actually
Hell yeah
Trump and his minions are obviously trying to scare old, white evangelical Christians. I just can’t wrap my head around how people like my mom and dad would believe these lies. The thing about attacking a strawman in politics is that you have to make your fallacies believable. Maybe living in a facebook echo chamber has really caused these scared old people to think that their grandkids are going to be forced into a sex change. 

My God, people need to take in a variety of news sources, not just Fox News and Glenn Beck.
You are correct that's a much bigger problem.
I’m honestly not that phased by the straightforward attack ads. My brain filters those out. 

The ones that fucked me up were the ads calling Kamala and Doug proud Israel supporters. Those were funded by right-wing PACs and are meant to suppress Muslim votes here in SE Michigan. The underhandedness of those ads makes me really fear mass psychological manipulation.
Not sure why you’re all butthurt. Get help 😂🤡
I'm guessing you're using an app on your TV, but if you or anyone else is using a firetv, SmartTube is your friend.
PiHole wont help with Youtube ads anyway, they are served from the same domain as normal Youtube content.
Same. I don't have any streaming services and YouTube is the only thing I watch, so it's absolutely worth it for me.
Correct. any "waterproof" paper is ineligible for recycling due to the waterproofing contaminates. ~~Those same contaminates prevent them from biodegrading as well. So they're effectively one of the worst trash out there.~~ Sorry, they Slow the biodegrading process greatly.
Actually, there is a de-inking process. the paper is pulped and the slurry can be cleaned. Paper recycling is a big business and the infrastructure to do this is already in place.
A lot of the 'glossy' paper is still recyclable. Some are coated in plastic, but the majority are coated in a fine clay or ceramic to make the paper shine (and also cost less than the plastic coating). Source: I work in print.
Gloss print can be recycled as long as the gloss is not a lamination and in most cases it isn't because that is costly. You just don't want to be burning it or putting that in your garden or compost it.
Let me clarify... that's marketing campaigns encouraging folks to buy something. I'm not entirely confident it translates to these. 2% would be big, but at what cost!? They both talk about reducing costs for Americans... this is not the way to achieve it.
Never going to happen unless Citizen's United is overturned and we move to publicly funded elections.
You’d think it might pierce the cognitive dissonance, but I posit it won’t.

Me too, these claims just show how ignorant and uninformed people are on how gender affirming care works though. It took my wife 3 years to get her surgery and they wouldn't even begin the extremely long and painful pre surgery process until she had lived as a woman for a full year.
Exactly. We've fallen backwards with this discourse and it's exhausting. Worse off, fighting disinformation is like trying to put out wild fires.
I'm assuming they're thinking like a UV gloss varnish, which is also recyclable. Source: little brother's school of can't hack it and worked at print shop
Flint PD won't take guns I find in the Flint River... It's concerning
(For context, I live over 2 hours away from Flint)

So I travel around the state of Michigan, cleaning out the waterways with a hobby called "Magnet Fishing" and I try to collect scrap steel and find some cool historic items, but I do stumble upon firearms from time to time, usually they are so old I can keep them, nut sometimes I find more recent drops in the rivers, so I have to hand it over to PD, I usually don't have an issue... until I started magnet fishing in Flint, MI. I don't call PD if I find like an old, rust coated revolver or rifle/shotgun. I will turn over more recent finds or something that could be salvageable for evidence (found 2 confirmed homicide weapons, potentially a third one recently that Lansing PD was looking for) 

The firearms in the pictures below were the ones I found that I tried to turn over to Flint PD. I even tried through going to their police station, they rejected any firearm I've tried to turn in... I do end up finding ways to turn them over to my local police station, but I definitely don't wanna happened to be pulled over with stuff like that in the car and try to explain to an officer that I found them in a river then potentially get arrested anyways...

The PX4 Storm and Hi point had no paper trail, so PD surprisingly let me keep those, I am waiting to hear back about the revolver. No details on the other one. 
Maybe worth talking to the state police in this situation.
The state police station is right over on Corunna rd, about a mile west of I-75, probably 10 minutes from the river. Might be worth a shot (no pun intended)
Might want to try a higher agency?
That’s insane. I’ve heard of so many magnet fishing finds to be linked to crimes, you’d think they would. Or even just proper disposal of a firearm.
It's amazing that they wouldn't be interested in taking those guns considering every single one, especially the hi point, has zero reason to end up in a river unless it was used in a homicide.
The ATF would also be interested in these firearms.  Flint most likely has an ATF task force that focuses on connecting firearms and shell casings between incidents.  


As for chain of custody,  I would suggest recording video while fishing, if you do not do so already.  You can easily explain where the firearms came from when pulled over.  When you do find a firearm involved in a murder, hopefully the video satisfies the defense, so you don't have to drive across the state to testify in court too.
To clarify, I do call non-emergency for Flint, an officer never shows up, I've seen officers just drive by us and keep going. I'm not too irritated by that, they could be busy, but it is annoying when we go to the station and they don't want to take them.
As someone who lives down the Flint River I just wanna say thank you for helping in cleaning it up. Even if it's just a hobby or you don't mean anything noble by it, in the end it really adds up.
Cops not wanting to do work? You don’t say.
313-202-3400

Try this number for the Michigan office of the ATF. I’m sure they’d be more helpful in this matter. 

The three people you should try to contact at the office are James Deir, Jessie Summers, or Keith Krolczyk. They are the managing agents and can point an agent toward this particular case.
I'd ask the Troopers or the Sheriff.

Things found in the river might honestly be not part of their jurisdiction, but they should still at least attempt to refer you to the relevant office.
Firearm issues are with MSP
Second State police or perhaps the county Sheriff's Dept
Just adding more lead to the water.
I work as a medic in Flint. Flint PD and Genesee County Sheriffs Dept are not who I would trust to get anything done remotely productive with that. Take that to MSP.
It's expensive to reopen cold cases. It takes a fair amount of work to determine if it's been used in any crimes or shootings. So it's easier to just do nothing. Frustrating.
Sounds like it's time to go to the press.
Try selling them to gunshops or private individuals. I'm sure they'll take notice then.
Not that this is an excuse, but you would be amazed how expensive and complicated disposing of firearms is for a police department. There are a lot of regulations surrounding what departments can do with seized/surrendered firearms. Certain parts of the gun have to be destroyed completely, the gun can't just go in the trash.
Genessee County Sheriff’s office. Ask for Chris Swanson the GCSO Undersheriff. He is a legitimate awesome guy that gives a shit about the community. 

Seriously, here’s Chris in action. 

https://youtu.be/UlPvWAyRVgE?si=wLQpQyxVaibhRds_
If you’re finding that many guns in the river, it sounds like Flint PD needs to hire someone to do magnet fishing. Maybe if people got caught the violent crime wouldn’t be so high …
While traveling with these firearms, you might want to invest in a lock box and keep it in the trunk. At least they wouldn't be just willy nilly in your vehicle. The video of you collecting them is great, too. Having them in a box for travel gives you a chance to explain.
>but I definitely don't wanna happened to be pulled over with stuff like that in the car and try to explain to an officer that I found them in a river then potentially get arrested anyways

That's why I recommend putting all the guns on a fish stringer so the cops know how you got them /s
Of course there’s a hi point lol
There's gotta be a joke about lead in the water here somewhere.
Damn px4 storm is a cool gun
A friend of mine used to work as an emt in flint.  He said the police would not even come out when they had people blackout drunk trying to drive vehicles.  They would say call the county.  The county would say call the city.
You can't expect the police to actually do investigative work when tickets need to be written
No cylinder and barrel means that’s 100% got a body on it lmao
Fuck those cops should be disciplined. You committed no crime until they instructed you to leave the station with weapons they know to not be yours.
Do you have the tiktok account? Not that police like to do their jobs ever but I'm always baffled they bellyache like you told them to clean their room whenever they have to come out and let you drop evidence right in their hands
i saw three people doing this in Montague at the bike path bridge over the white river last weekend. was that you?
I dont want them either. Neat though.
Have you tried the DNR?
Maybe they tossed the hi-point because they got it as a gift, and upon opening the gift they saw it was a hi-point & discarded it.
They don’t want their old guns back. Why do you think they threw them in the river in the first place…
You just become familiar with sheriff departments if you are traveling.  They might be more apt to help than local pds.  Having a point of contact in the MSP that would give you names of local troopers would be cool too.
I wonder if the FBI or ATF might care
After months of pushback, Michigan State Police announced Tuesday March 9, 2021 that they are changing how they dispose of guns collected in buyback programs. the guns were technically not destroyed to standards set by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the company police contracted with was actually breaking down the weapons and selling the parts.
Flint officials say they were unaware gun parts from buybacks were not destroyed.
Flint and other communities in the state can dispose of such weapons through arrangements with Michigan State Police.
Someone is seeing this post and sweating bullets
This seems like the kind of thing a good newspaper would like to know.
Michigan FFL here. If flint PD won’t take them and you don’t want to drive them around I’d contact Michigan State Police as they’re ultimately in charge of firearms in Michigan.
They don't want to do work.
Folks don't seem to have considered the possibly that the cops don't want them because it's too much trouble to throw them in the river again.
I would contact the local news on this- maybe if they run the story that will build pressure for them to answer to this.
when i heard there was lead in the water i wasn’t expecting that
Flint PD only has like 5 or 6 cops currently. One of them is a close friend of mine. They are completely overwhelmed up there. it’s very sad.
Supreme Court said the police don’t have to protect the public only property so I’m not surprised they have no interest in the public well being or safety
Are you the guy with the magnet fishing You Tube channel? If so, it's great. I have no suggestions, just hope you get resolution
Well, to be fair, in Flint, lead belongs in the water. I'm surprised they didn't make you throw it back in.
They must have some skeletons in that river huh?
or even the feds
After they say no, have you ever tried just sitting them on the counter and walking out. I am curious what they would do. Force you to take them with you?
That's kinda bad they won't take them. Even ignoring the high possibility of being a homicide weapon, with our pistol registry it's not like you can just hang on to them either.

What would you even put down for the seller if you tried to turn in the paperwork? "found in a river" lol.
Flint PD doesn’t do anything in my experience  😂😅
Someone is not using the correct bait.
Try MSP.
Flint PD hardly has the budget to keep officers on payroll, they wont do anything that requires extra work. Take it to the Sheriff's office in Genesee, Swanson is a fantastic Sheriff.
Try contacting the prosecuting attorneys office. Tell them your experience. They may or may not be interested.  There's always the risk that a found gun proves someone innocent, which may be the reason that the cops don't want them. Remember,  there's zero incentive for law enforcement to be honest, as their careers are based on convictions.
Is that you I’ve been seeing mag fishing off the dort Highway bridge?
As a flint citizen this is concerning lmao
It's real concerning that Flint doesn't care about these, especially since that PX4 doesn't look like it's been down there all that long.
They won’t take them because then they would actually have to do some work and see if they were used in a crime. 
If they won’t take them, then what do you do with them?
So commit crimes in flint. Throw gun in river. Fish it out myself and then never worry about evidence?
Flint has like 8 police officers for the entire city. Notoriously understaffed. You call them to handle something, and they will be there like 36 hours later. They don't want your paperwork lol
PX4 Beretta, Smith & Wesson looks like an easy nine, or shield, parts of a wheel gun looks like Smith & Wesson again, And then the last one is a cheap piece of shit that somebody probably shot somebody with and then toss it in the river. Also known as a high point at a low point
The Storm might be salvageable.
If the serial number is intact you can send the Hi Point in for warranty and get a new one
Send photos to the sheriff on Ig. He’s pretty active online.
Guess you’ll have to save them for the next gun buy back then sell them to them
Flint PD, doing their best to ignore crimes.
Hey HiPoints have a lifetime warranty. Try sending it in for warranty work 🤣
If you ever find a marlin 22 or Remington 308 in the river lmk…. Mine got stolen in Davison at Williams gunsight and 90% sure the security guard was in on it
Sheriff's department
Ahh so you made this post so that if you get pulled over with your illegal murder weapon collection you have an alibi. Very smart move 😍



Get him, boys!
Just wait until the next guns for boats promotion!

😂😂😂
Probably them chucking them into the river
Give them to the homeless, they need protection too
All i'm hearing is free guns. Sweet.
Something sketchy went on with that hipoint, can’t see why else someone would remove the grips
FBI will take it
I feel like when you have magnet fishing gear and a solid record of turning in weapons you find, you'll be ok if you get pulled over.....unless you're a hit man and thay was your master plan all along
They might have to do work
They don't want open cases
Cool, free pistols
...Free gun
Make sure you document every refusal to investigate a potential piece of evidence. Forward to higher level state and federal agencies. Flint PD looking mighty suspicious.
Usually pistol registration is done with the county sheriffs office. I don’t think MSP even has access to all of the inter-county documentation from the local municipalities. Best to start with the sherif. I’m not even sure if county pistol records are posted on a statewide system. I found that most counties don’t talk to each other, or if they do it’s on paper. For evidence sake.

I also wanted to add that different branches of law enforcement handle different things. MSP is traffic, investigation, pacification state wide. Vs your local PD. Sheriffs enforce law, serve warrants, work at court, etc. it’s a lot of paperwork, all to be available if the police ever do need it.
Good place to toss your murder weapons
Nobody wants to work anymore
Flint PD is so overwhelmed and understaffed. Not to say that it’s right, but it’s a systemic issue.
Ahh the px4 always loved those
So they want to solve crimes or not? 
Even if they don’t have a killer they will have a weapon which could link em to more crimes. That could lead to a killer. 

Not even collecting evidence is shameful.
Lazy local cops don't want the paperwork. Call the ATF and FBI and let them know.

On another note, ypu could wait for the gun buybacks, no questions asked, and make them take them then lol. You'll even get paid!
Dang that Beretta px4 storm is quite the find.. those were quite a unique design
State or Federal cops?
You don’t dump guns for no reason
Definitely take them to the County Sheriff’s Office, Fifth St (not ave) and Saginaw
Bro you're pulling from their dump spot
If the police aren't interested in helping, your local media will love to do a story on them not being interested in helping.
Dude you’ve got a murder weapon collection
[removed]
Definitely bodies on those guns.
Try the Michigan State Bureau of Investigation or the FBI.
ah yes, a hipoint, a gun you buy solely for killing someone and getting rid of it
The department is probably concerned about you returning evidence that may incriminate their officers.
Not only is the government not coming to take your guns, they wont even let you give them guns.
Maybe the police ARE the paper trail?
I thought this was a picture of Fallout 4 gameplay for a sec.
In Flint you get your choice of low velocity lead poisoning or high velocity lead poisoning...
Well, you did say it was Flint so…
What? Do you want them to do their job or something? How silly.
They will warranty that HighPoint.
Probably cause the police were the ones that ditched the guns 😂.
Those are sacrificial anodes as part of their new corrosion control treatment plan s/
A gun buy back would be a great place to get some spending cash from these
They don't take them because you're giving them work to do.
So this is where the lead in the water comes from.
Well yeah, that means they’d have to work instead of sitting on their ass collecting OT.
I can't give you advice, but I think you have a cool hobby and applaud you for trying to do the right thing.  Well done.
That's because they dumped these guns there.
Wait. Michigan police being lazy and ineffective 🤔
Police are generally not concerned with making the country a safer place. They're fraternal brotherhood lobbies for longer sentences for nonviolent offenders.
But then they might have to do some police work.
They probably threw some they used on extra judicial killings
They don’t want their evidence (against them) back
That beretta nova looks new and probably stolen.
 "2 confirmed homicide weapons" - AWESOME! Thanks! I am sure that the loved ones of the homicide victims will be very appreciative if your efforts lead to a conviction!

Apparently it’s hard to *not* find guns laying around in Flint. Reminds me of this story: https://www.theoaklandpress.com/2004/04/12/children-find-guns-during-egg-hunt/
FREE RIO!!!
That revolver has been broken down in such a way that it *must * have been used in a crime.
I’m from the streets of flint and I’m telling you now, them guns been used in crimess
Why would they? It’s not like criminals would dispose of evidence by throwing it in a river.
So you're saying I need to get a magnet and go fishing. Got it.
People toss these guns because they know they can just easily get another one

Because we manufacturer wayyyy too many guns in this country

Because we can't recognize that guns are a problem, and then they're used for murders and tossed in rivers.
[deleted]
Imagine the work it would create if that gun was actually involved in a crime, will nobody think of the police.
My guess they probably just don’t want to work, that’s pretty common with police.
you're getting FREE GUNS and you're trying *to turn them in*?
Probably because the are thousands..
Really ?
Of course they don’t, then they’d have to do actual work in tracing what murder was commuted by said gun.

Sounds aggravating, no thanks.
What reason do they give?
I'll give you $50 for the Beretta
You should probably just throw them back, thats my suggestion as a resident of Flint.
free guns can’t beat that.
Flint Michigan's a long way from Hollywood
Can I have that .40? It looks fixable.
I will buy them
Those are cop drop guns?
I thought it was mandatory that they did for investigation purposes
So the city of Flint had a gun buyback program a few months ago to get guns off the streets (or water ways, lol) but won't take the guns you found in for free? 

Hopefully you can find a law enforcement agency to take those off your hands as I personally wouldn't want to be around any firearms found in a river. No telling how many bodies are connected with them. 

And even something as innocuous as magnet fishing and finding throw away guns could be a headache for you.
I’ve actually encountered something similar before.

We once hooked into a shotgun in the river. Brought it to the local police and they wouldn’t take it. Like WTF!?
Probably trying protect themselves. Few of those Probably from shitty cops
Maybe the ATF is another good agency to contact?
OP just throw them away, if you are concerned you can disassemble them further but those guns don’t look very functional.
Flint probably just doesn't have any budget for storage and shipping and testing these. 

The city has hemorrhaged money, and you're better off having a larger agency with overlapping jurisdiction take it
Why does that PX4 look so... Off?
That looks like a glock, should be able to clean it up and take it to the range!
That's a little surprising, but what would the police be able to do with them other than destroy them? They won't have useful DNA or fingerprints, so no way to link them to someone. Even if they could still fire and be used for ballistics, again, there's no way to connect them with a criminal. That's why they get thrown in the river.
Give them to MSP. Maybe they will check them out after they get done running over suspects to kill them.
Welp. That's fucked up.
I’d sit in flints parking lot and call the ATF and tell them flint police are refusing to take them. I bet an agent would be over to take them right away.
A lot of cities are like that….
Unsolved murder in the area looking for the weapon?? Anyone? Anyone?
Take them it to the press, tell them the police refuse to do anything with them, not even look at them. I'm sure they will suddenly pretend to care when a possible news article is made.
I heard about issues with lead in the water, but this is ridiculous.
Take it to the media! Show em phone call records etc of you attempting to have police dispose properly. It’ll grab airwaves.
The Beretta looks pretty salvageable if you don't mind owning a murder weapon, free pistol
Would calling 911, or state police non emergency line be enough to start a paper trail in case of getting pulled over? Or at least your past turn ins should keep you safe. Always a gamble if a cop wants an outlet tho..
Email the mayor.
They won’t, but I will
One of them is more like a handle now
You can send them as junk i can take them of your hands
If I had to guess; they probably aren’t as useful to solving crimes as you might expect.  The barrels are probably damaged enough by being underwater they can be used to match bullets.  Same with extractor marks.  Unlikely to find dna or prints.  Can’t prove who put it there so even tying back to ownership won’t help much.
Might be a fun local news story too
Leave them on the sidewalk outside the police department. Just don't get seen doing it.
There’s really no easy way to link a gun to a past crime.  Likely the rifling in the barrels is too corroded to match with a bullet, if they even have a bullet associated with a crime to begin with.  Then how do you figure out who was using the gun?  I can guarantee that the serial numbers are all scratched off or they’re stolen to begin with.  Just a bunch of dead ends
Maybe it is because they are Hi-Points
Of course they won’t, Flint Pd is completely useless
Flint Town on Netflix was the most wild police documentary I’ve ever seen. Three days to respond to violent crimes?!
I’ll take that PX4 compact off ya. Send it to my FFL if it’s not hot lol.
Interesting, that a "no paper trail gun" would be a keeper. You would think that would raise eyebrows. But, I guess, because it can't be refired for ballistics testing, it has no evidently value, a ghost gun.
That poor px4….
I'm doubting if that gun is operable anymore
I'll take that s&w if you want to sell
Google who on the East side of the state is doing a gun-buyback.
what about ATF?
Put them all together and craft a functional one 👍
Guns are notorious for ending up in rivers under extremely unsuspicious circumstances, so it would probably be a waste of time to take them.
Put them up on Craigslist/FB Marketplace...

> Do you want a second chance to destroy the evidence? $150/pound.
Oh that’s where we put all of our secret murder weapons.  Bout to be one added to the pile
Free guns... and you are trying to give them away? This wouldn't fly in Florida lol
Flint did a gun buy back a couple months ago. You could have made them pay you for those guns
That Hi Point 100 had bodies on it !
That PX 4 could be a recent dump. Nice gun too. You got some murder boys up there. Setting up a game camera could catch them. Could also get you killed, so could just being there. Be cautious
Save them all up until Detroit does another gun buyback.  They typically offer $100/handgun and $200/long gun.

I mean to be fair not surprising that a government entity in Flint I'd failing to do their job.
Sweet!  Free guns!
Could solve or help in an open unsolved crime… piss off the locals and contact the FBI.
Incompetent police in america? No way.
They let you keep possibly-operational, functional, and UNREGISTERED firearms?  

News at 10 tonight: Flint PD officers found to be guilty of selling stolen guns from evidence locker, refuse gun returns so as to not have them linked back to them
Is it because of the high concentration of lead?
That hi point was 100% used in a murder. A cheap ass gun dumped in the river.
Your best bet would probably be the ATF if the local PDs aren’t interested.
I'll take them
Save them for the gun buybacks.
Contact the FBI . That high point is definitely on FIRE. 
That Beretta should clean up nicely.
Honestly, that PX4 looks like it's in pretty good condition. A deep clean and some new oil and you probably got yourself a new murder weapon.
Lead contamination
Sounds like free guns to me
Did I hear free px4
Start a YT channel about fishing for guns and restoring them. 🤷🏽‍♂️
Gear adrift is a gift
Watch season 2 of The Wire and you’ll understand why.
I found a pistol in its case at the end of my driveway under some leaves in the gutter. 

Flint police came and got it from me.
Clean the hi point up and send it to hi point they will give you a brand new one.
They’d rather assault everyday citizens and pretend to know the law they’re supposed to enforce than do real police work
To be fair, I also wouldn’t take a Hi Point or a PX4 Storm if you tried to give them to me.
Sounds like Flint to me!
Are you YouTube? Because I’ve seen someone in Michigan doing this on YouTube. If it’s you can you remind me of your channel.
Haven't you seen all the videos of people finding weapons even bomb's and the local PD gets pissy when you give concern.
How does chain of custody work with something like this?
Make an art installation of the guns you find. Maybe after you get a dozen.. or 50.. or 100, it will catch their attention.
Tell the Feds
Maybe try a state bureau of investigation?
I feel like there’s only a couple of reasons guns end up in rivers
FBI might
Pigs are worried they might have to do a bit of work, what a surprise
Well...it's been in the water. So there's that.
Can that first S&W sidearm be restored to full and safe operating condition?
Prolly guns they planted on their local cons 
#Fuck12
im sure your pissing somebody off.... Cold cases
Because then they have to do actual work and they don’t want that smoke.
All I’m hearing is free guns in the river
I’ll gladly take them!
that px4 mini looks in pretty good shape...snappy little devil that appears to be 40 cal holy shit
We had a shotgun that was my FILs. We didn’t want it, and didn’t want the hassle of selling it. I asked the police for where to dispose of it safely, they basically told me to kick rocks.
Neither one of them will?
I'm surprised you could get a magnet to stick to a hi-point....
That .40 is freeeeesh
Someone needs to be matching that up like ASAP
[deleted]
I'll buy ut
I wouldnt want the hipoint either
That Beretta is FRESH. Like just a couple of days.
Dude I want a free px4. Wtf.
who the fuck in their right minds would throw a px4 storm into a river
I wouldn’t want to touch the water in Flint either
even the police know how contaminated that water is !!!!
The PX4 looks savable… 🤷‍♂️
I own that first gun, so strange to see a Beretta come from a river.
Magnet fishing seems crazy cool
Honest to god… document EVERYTHING. Take these to state police. And if nothing happens with ANY of MI’s other departments?

Blast it on the news. Take all your evidence to the press and ask to remain anonymous. If the cops won’t help you, let the whole state know that their taxes aren’t being used to protect and serve anything. As long as you’re a “concerned citizen,” and everything you say is truthful and provable, you’ll be legally protected. 

**not legal advice, definitely look into that and make an informed decision before enacting my random Reddit comment, but it might be worth a shot.
That poor px4 :(
Probably their weapons
This is a true crime podcast waiting to happen.
Call the FBI
Flint PD won’t even answer the phone.
That would make extra work!
What was the reason given by them? I have never had any issue like this. They always have been great to work with when I find stuff going magnet fishing.
I'll buy it
It's work for them...
How many people do y’all think these guns have killed?
The first one is in good enough shape the serial number should still be in tact
That first one doesn’t look too old…
include quicksand party noxious wine historical toothbrush tan plough telephone

 *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*
That first one is still pretty fresh
Yeah, this is Michigan. There are still 2 other agencies who can handle this. I'd honestly start with the Genessee County sheriff's department and then the MSP. In my experience the sheriff's dept is usually more "invested" in local stuff than MSP who can literally just be transferred in from anywhere.
I was thinking this as well as perhaps the Genesee County sheriff might be interested.
Definitely something to take to the MSP.
This, 100%
Seconded.
[deleted]
If they do gun buybacks, just clean them up a bit and bring em in then and they’ll pay you for them
I went to the one kinda by Flint Central High school, I've tried a few different stations in the area. I'd have to see if I tried that one already.

Appreciate it
MiB?
Exactly, I've found 2 that were confirmed to be used in homicides. I've had no issues with any other police department. Only issues with Flint PD. Hell Flint PD will harass me while I'm magnet fishing (not all officers, but many) and they'll tell us that "magnet fishing is illegal" or some obvious bs. Makes me think some cops might be the ones who confiscate guns when they pull someone over then throw it off a bridge.
That's exactly why they don't want them, it's more work. They have to actually do their jobs and fill out a couple forms.
Police do not want to do their jobs. They just like to harass people and give them tickets.
Firearm disposal is a pain for law enforcement. Most of them are paying a third party to do it. And that third party is generally breaking down the firearm, cutting up the serialized component (the actual legal firearm) and selling off the rest of the parts.
Right? I read this and thought, 'Flint PD doesn't want to...solve crimes?'
Yeah that hi point and then the Smith& Wesson snub nose cut in half I am worried about, however, the High Point came back with no paper trail. The PX4 storm I did get back from my local police station surprisingly enough. I thought it was for sure stolen.
Then they couldnt blame the low rate of solved murders on the community.
I brought them to my local station. I don't like traveling across the state with them though while traveling back home. Also from my understanding, the best way to turn in a firearm in Flint is to hand it over to a park ranger officer. I'm not sure if they have an ATF task force or not. I'd imagine with all the gun violence in Flint
As long as you lose them in a boating accident it’s ATF approved. Nothing to see, move along, etc.
That makes no sense.

In a city like Flint I would think the police would want as many leads as possible to (potential) firearm crimes and would appreciate a good citizen's input.
No problem, there is so much metal in the Flint river. It's always a blast when I make the trip there, cops are kinda jerks when they stop by, but met some cool cops in the area too. I've been mostly fishing around the bad part of Flint, like around Dort highway all the way to downtown. Found 13 firearms in Flint in 5 trips. Technically 16, but 3 of those fell off my magnet and couldn't find them again 😭. I did get to keep some super cool stuff I found at least.

 I found an 1800s railroad lamp, a 3 pound cannonball, a few BB guns (don't count those under guns) a motorcycle, and some cool pocket knives. I did get to keep a few of the firearms we found in Flint cuz they were pretty old. My favorite find in Flint gotta be that Px4 storm or parts to a MAT-49 submachine gun (got to keep the bolt assembly and barrel!)
In my experience cops are the laziest profession in existence.
A few officers I talked to that stopped by said they don't trust their own department 😂
The "science" behind ballistic testing is also dubious at best, even before the firearm has rusted over at the bottom of a river which would definitely alter the striation pattern. 


That kind of testing is only "exclusionary". You can't actually fire a bullet from a gun and then identify the firearm used like a fingerprint. 


A firearm found in a river has very little or no value at all to a homicide investigation/trial. 
Yet you can bet if they found you in possession of it after they wouldn't take it they'll throw you in jail.
I'm not old enough, that's one of the main concerns and kinda didn't want to include that in the post. I can own and buy rifles and shotguns, but not handguns yet.
[Flint Michigan has the one of the lowest homicide clearance rates in the country.](https://www.criminallegalnews.org/news/2018/feb/16/us-murder-clearance-rates-among-lowest-world/#:~:text=But%20official%20methods%20of%20reporting,murder%20clearance%20rate%20at%2017.5%25.)

It sounds like they aren’t super interested in getting those numbers up.
Yeah I wear a camera on my chest recording what I find. I usually just have the Firearms buried in a bucket underneath my rope and other random crap we find. I'll definitely have to get a lock box for sure, that's a good idea.
Yup always, found 3 Hi-Point C9 s 😂
Yep they won't come out for bodies either until like the next day. Found one over by Utah dam in Flint, nobody showed up, ended up calling state PD, Flint PD showed up the next day after state dealt with it. This was back in like march
Too much paperwork
The only ones I wanted was the px4 storm because I heard those are really nice. I was super lucky to get that one back from my local station. I found probably over 50 firearms by now so it's kinda just an inconvenience to find them at this point.
I am doing an interview with fox 17 later this week
There are a lot of Michigan magnet fishers in Michigan that do YouTube. I do YouTube, but I don't post much. I mostly post on tiktok and Facebook atm.
Found things worse than skeletons in the river there unfortunately...
I've called Flint PD. I want to say six times, Never had a flint officer show up. Had people call the cops on me and they show up within 15 minutes 🤣 

Guess they don't like Magnet Fishers...
The serial number on it indicates it was made in 2018 according to GRPD. They couldn't get much off the serial. Was able to claim it, it's inoperable right now, don't want it functional.
I bring them over to GRPD, near where I live. I can usually claim firearms from grpd since I do most of my magnet fishing in the Grand rapids area, I'm pretty sure most of the officers here know who I am by now. However, when I'm traveling hours away from Grand Rapids, I try to call non-emergency and hand it in.
The first two are 40s, I believe the revolver is 357 could be a 38 special, I believe it's a Smith& Wesson model 686 but I could be wrong, serial starts in "CFS" then the last one's a high point C9 :/. 
The M&P is a 40C, So I'm pretty sure it's a compact M&P like a 2.0 Shield
Needs new firing pin and it's good to go, but I don't want it functional
Yeah the serial number is perfectly visible and not damaged. I'm not sure how High Point warranty works exactly, especially since I'm under 21
I found a Marlin 30-30 in Lansing, but it looks like it's been in the river for a really long time.
Found 13 guns magnet fishing in Flint in 5 trips, hell I found a rifle just sitting on the river bank not even in the water. I also found a gun holster with a .45 in a parking lot of an abandoned school
Doesn't surprise me, got any spots to recommend 😂 

JK I am not really looking for guns, but would love to cross ~functional rifle~ off my bucket list, especially since it is technically legal to keep since nobody registers rifles
No one just throws a gun away unless they did something illegal with it...
The issue is I live on the west side of the state, not the east side. if I lived in the Detroit area I would totally just run my guns through Detroit, because I found guns in Detroit and never had issues with Detroit PD, Detroit PD is actually one of the better departments I've interacted with when it comes to turning in Firearms.
It's not "useable" evidence. They basically tell me they don't want the firearms. Yet they still have visible serial numbers, so at the very least they could run numbers to see if the firearm is stolen. I honestly doubt they'd get very good ballistics off the pistols. The main issue is that I'm under 21. Any firearms I keep are completely pointless to try to clean up, they are super old. I don't like having things that COULD be restored because as long as it isn't operable and is all rusted, technically it isn't considered a firearm until it's partially operable.
2 of the guns I just kinda splashed some water on them and they were completely functional, probably not safe to shoot.
I'm going to be on Fox 17 sometime this week about this actually!
All four of those guns actually have perfectly visible serial numbers. I mean a few of the guns you had to clean the mud off of it but you could read the numbers plain as day. I would have been fine with them just doing a serial search real quick. Not full out rejecting to take firearms
Took them the next day to arrive when I reported a body in Flint, state PD arrive within 20-30 minutes after I called them after calling Flint non emergency and then 911
Well, it's actually a lot more common than you would think. Especially with older guns. What they mean by paper trail is it just shows no history of an owner. They can still find where it was sent out to and where it was sold if they had the same system the ATF uses.
Yeah but I'm too young to just keep random pistols
I am the magnetizer on YouTube, but I don't do YouTube much, my original channel got demonetized due to the guns being found so had to make a new channel :(
Someone who stole it or shot someone???
They told me that it wasn't "usable evidence" 

That's bs cuz I found guns in worse condition and they ended up being linked to homicides.
The Genessee sheriff seems to be a good man. I was impressed with his handling of my cousin's abduction and murder.

Edit: thank you all for your sympathies. It was very hard for our large and close family. She was much older than me, and we were not close, but would always say hello and make small talk. Still, she was a mother, sister, wife, aunt, daughter, cousin, and in the end, victim of domestic violence. I am so thankful they never gave up looking for her, and that her children got closure. The sheriff department kept the case on everyone's mind until she was found. I believe their perseverance is the only reason Kelly was brought home.
I would trust a county agency before MSP honestly
Absolutely talk to the sheriff. IDK about your particular one, but most Ive met are from the area and actual care.
There's also the ATF if all else fails.
The ATF is always interested if local/state PD won’t respond. When I found a shotgun in the ditch by my in laws and the local PD and state didn’t respond I reached out to the ATF who came out the next day.
Will be right at Corunna Rd and Linden Rd. Look for the big radio tower coming from the building it’s brown and has a big blue stripe on the building as well. That’s the state police post and genesee county dispatch
maybe try walking in while waiving them around and see if that gets you any attention?
What exactly did all these police stations tell you to do with the gun then? They don’t care about you keeping it?
FiB
girl scouts
They probably just don't want extra work and there are protocols that they're supposed to follow for abandoned or discarded firearms.
Not surprised. Flint is a shit hole and Flint PD is useless from my one experience there. I was visiting a friend there and I went with him and his friends to a club. When we left a drunk ass motherfucker was talking shit for no reason. My friend's friend talked shit back. Next thing we know the drunk guy elbowed our rear windshield and shattered it lol. He got cut up pretty bad and honestly we were pissed so we gave him and his other drunk friends an ass whooping. Bouncers called the cops on both of us and we had no problem with that. We waited an hour and they didn't show up. So we just left lol.
> Only issues with Flint PD. Hell Flint PD will harass me while I'm magnet fishing (not all officers, but many) and they'll tell us that "magnet fishing is illegal" or some obvious bs.

strap a gopro to your cap

Wouldn't be surprised. I had winning bid on a valuable antique pistol from an online auction. Next day a tiny PD calls and tells the auction company the serial number trace revealed it was stolen and a cop came and got it. I called MSP with the SN and they had no record of it at all.
Some of those that work forces…..
How did you find out two were used in homicides? I have a hard time believing the cops would get back to the person turning it in to tell them that. Or did they contact you later because they wanted more info about how it was found? Do you do anything special to document the exact location in case something you find ends up being important to a case? 

It would be really cool to know one of your finds resulted in someone finally getting justice over an unsolved crime.
So when they try to tell you magnet fishing is illegal, what do you say in return? I know they are full of it. But it's also the Flint PD. They probably wouldn't think twice about holding you without charges for a few weeks just to teach you a lesson or take you out on the spot because they are bored.
If you're interested, there was a miniseries about them in 2018 called Flint Town. It's shocking on all accounts, but as someone who lived there during the time it was filmed, not at all surprising. The one bit of credence I will give them is that they are understaffed and overworked - it's no secret that Flint has more than its fair share of crime and pitifully low funding - but the PD does themselves absolutely no favors. 

Knowing that Covid only made things worse is really quite the tragedy for the residents. I'm glad I left when I did.
> Exactly, I've found 2 that were confirmed to be used in homicides.

Woah, how were you able to confirm? Did it lead anywhere? (If you don’t mind my asking)
Hey, you should get a state agency involved for your own safety. Maybe there's nothing other than laziness behind all this, but if there are more nefarious causes to their refusal to accept the firearms, you could ga e a target on your back. They know your car, they know where you live. News is another layer of protection.
I wouldn’t be surprised at all in all honesty. I once did exactly that to a bong I seized instead of going through the hassle of all the paperwork and process of what I was technically supposed to do. I just threw it out the window while driving over the bridge.
Too much paperwork, not enough physical aggression
It's so much easier pulling people over for traffic violations. That sounds like actual work.
Flint PD are less than worthless. I made the mistake of going to Flint for a concert once. Stopped to get something to eat and the friend I was with got robbed by a crackhead in the Burger King bathroom. Flint police just straight up told him they didnt care and weren't going to show up.
It's entirely plausible someone's paying them to \*not\* stick their noses into things. "Local businessmen" and such.
Probably useless in court unfortunately due to chain of evidence but it's weird they wouldn't at least want to take it see what can be done and dispose of it.
I went one step further and thought "Flint PD doesn't want to solve crimes (they committed.)"
As a flint native this sentence is hilarious because of course they don't, flint notoriously has one of the most corrupt police departments.
As a guy with experience of having a gun stolen and later recovered, apparently most departments don't try returning stolen firearms. 


According to the Deputy that called me, she was surprised I answered and was amazed I wanted it, coming in immediately. 


She said so many phone numbers change that most departments won't even try the listed number, at least if it's been a few years. 


With that said, no idea if they would give it to you or destroy it if they don't try to give it to the owner - mine was apparently recovered by a drug task force 3 years before they called and asked - had to clear appeals first. 
I actually have the ATF contact for the Flint area, at least from a few years back. If you want his contact info feel free to DM me! He was super helpful when I last worked with him, so may at least know who else to contact.
The thing is there is a really high violent crime rate in Flint, especially gun violence rates. So I can totally understand them not wanting to send an officer down for a call like that. However, if I'm bringing a firearm to the station they should take that, not tell me they don't want it. Especially since I'm under the age of 21...
More leads -> more crimes.
The Flint PD evidence room is probably overflowing, and they almost certainly have a massive backlog of evidence (that might take years or decades to process) and that's evidence that will likely be useful for a prosecution.

The odds that they'll be able to tie the magnet fishing guns to a crime *and* have it be useful for a prosecution are not great.  If you actually think about it, the PD not wanting to take junk that has no clear connection to a crime actually makes sense.
Flint has enough lead as it is.

Oh, LEADS.
1800s railroad lamp with the double threat of being great table decor and an amazing conversation starter!
I'm just here to say that this whole post and thread has been super interesting to read. I really hope you find a good agency that will lawfully process the found guns. There must be a procedure out there in a state statute or federal law that addresses this issue, because if it could help solve a homicide case, it seems like some agency out there would want to know. My friend had 8 guns that she took from her mentally unstable boyfriend. She wanted an agency to hold them or just take them because he was having manic episodes and talking about hurting people. Ottawa county wanted nothing to do with them and didn't even ask for further information. I know this is an entirely different situation, but with the amount of crimes and tragedies that are the result of guns in the hands of the wrong people,  it seems like law enforcement agencies would have policies in place to handle these situations.  Thanks for your efforts to do the right thing with these guns you find!
lol, There’s a nonzero chance that they threw it in there themselves
Because you're now a current case that could have to pay court fees, probation fees and many other fees.
You must be 18yo to purchase, possess, transport and carry a pistol in Michigan. 

You must be 21yo to purchase a pistol from an FFL dealer.
This is legit the number one reason.
that's the subcompact which doesn't have the rotating barrel that makes them light on recoil.

only the compact and the full-sized have that rotating barrel.

my subcompact in 9mm is snappy, and the first one I ever owned was in 40s&w like the one you fished and it was even worse on the recoil.

still, can't beat the price!

and yes....[i have 3 sizes of the same gun](https://imgur.com/gallery/beretta-px4-storm-family-full-size-compact-subcompact-tB5EDAq).  I like the PX4 Storms.
Perfect! Thanks for the reply.
I was trapped in a trap house for hours in flint the cops never did a thing- 8 or so years ago. I would reach out to state bois
I love watching the videos that people put out on the items they find, magnet fishing. It’s so cool!
[deleted]
I agree.  Would be nice for the rightful owners of the guns to get them back, assuming they were reported stolen.  Even if they are all messed up and corroded internally
Yeah, I haven’t heard that one. They are always cool with me. They are still supposed to take the weapon anyways if they can’t use it and disarm/dispose of it. I would take it in again and ask for the sergeant if they tell you no. They shouldn’t be telling you no.
I am so sorry.
Sorry to read that.
So sorry. I've lost a cousin (she had cancer) when she was just a baby. I know how it feels.
So glad she was brought home. My condolences.

My dad’s first cousin was kidnapped and murdered too.

Rest In Peace, Betty Lou.
holy fuck emotional whiplash. sorry for your loss my dude.
The counterpoint being that county sheriffs are elected partisan politicians (with no requirement of being successful or even experienced in law enforcement), and the way their departments are run typically highlights this fact. Whereas the MSP is not elected and is pretty far removed from the partisan politics of the governor they ultimately answer to, and that disconnection can be an asset in many situations. I don't think there's a one-size-fits-all blanket statement that applies to choosing between local police, county sheriff, or state police; each has their time/place in the viewpoint of a citizen trying to accomplish a goal, like OP.
Working ems, I always found the county mounties more down to earth.
Dar Leaf has entered the chat...
You know who runs the crime lab that the county sends their stuff to? It’s the Michigan State Police

Appreciate it. Next time I'm in Flint and we happen to find a firearm, I'll try over there!
“Calmer than you are”
Exactly.  They either take it or register it.
That's in Illinois
So acting as cops are expected to act: lazy and useless.
Then they should quit and find a different job
I wear a go pro when I'm out magnet fishing
Are the same that burn crosses….
Cuz I called the station and was told by unclaimed property. I got an incident number and I usually run the majority of my firearms through this station so I got the main unclaimed property guys personal number to get info on the stuff I turn in. 

Also I get police reports on every firearm I turn it specifying information on the firearm and stating I claimed the firearm (if I got to keep it) 

The ones I can't keep, I don't get any sort of paperwork.
I always wear a go pro so if they tried that, I'd get video evidence of the entire things and could press the issue. I educate the officer (nicely) about how magnet fishing is perfectly legal and no restrictions to the area, and we pick up after ourselves. If they decide to be a dick about it, I just ignore them and continue fishing and will pretend they don't exist, because at that point they are trying to cause a scene and get a reason to put me in a cruiser or something.
I don't have a lot of information on it myself. The only reason why I know that is because I got to know the main guy who runs the unclaimed property office and he was able to give me that information. I know the one person got sentenced last year after I turned that gun in a few years prior and then the one I found last year, I haven't really heard a whole lot. I'm pretty sure they just started trials on that case back in March after I found that pistol in December. I could be wrong on that. 

The first firearm I turned in that was linked to a homicide was a Beretta M9, which the guy used his own pistol (lived in Illinois) and he shot his wife and daughter, then fled up to Michigan and took the gun apart, I found the frame to the Beretta m9, police found the rest of the gun in a dumpster. The pistol frame was in maybe neat deep water, 15 feet out from shore at a park. The guy was caught in Rockford Michigan late 2021, remember exactly when. 

The second gun was an M&P I found right by a railroad bridge in Grand Rapids, They already had the guy in custody but He wasn't in trial yet. I don't know if it started yet at all. I haven't gotten too much information and I haven't seen anything on the news about it. I didn't even get really a whole lot of information on who he killed or anything. All I know is he got drunk and he shot somebody and then he got scared and ditched it.
Yeah wouldn't surprise me if a cop decided to throw A confiscated gun into the river
I mean, that’s not great, but the chances of someone being murdered with the bong probably aren’t too high.
You mean Netflix won't show up again to do a documentary if they're just doing paperwork?
And only those violations that let them hang out parked in the median or hassle poor folks into vehicle searches.
That’s fucked😂 how long ago was this? A friend of mine said only state police go into Pontiac anymore also.
Yeah I can usually claim a firearm from the station I usually bring the firearms I find after 60-90 days. It's usually around 6 months before I can pick them up (if they are paperweights). 

GRPD told me they usually don't return firearms but since the pieces I find usually aren't operable, just have visible numbers, they likely don't do any sort of ballistic matching. A few months ago I got a px4 storm I turned over to GRPD (found it in Flint) and I called GRPD like 6 weeks later and they said it was good to pick up and claim. I was honestly surprised. I guess it depends on the department.

I'm amazed I haven't found more guns reported stolen. Usually they just come back with no paper trail. Wonder if they can only run local and not national like the ATF.
> With that said, no idea if they would give it to you or destroy it if they don't try to give it to the owner

Lol! Destroy it?

You know why they don’t try very hard to return evidence right? Because they sell that shit at police auctions and make money. 

I’ve known multiple people who have had possessions wrongly confiscated, then when they are deemed to be lacking evidence and the case gets dismissed, those possessions are never returned and just go to making the department money. 

And they love to take electronics whenever possible. Laptops and hard drives. Even if what you were accused of has next to no chance of having evidence in digital form. It’s because they can sell them for a lot.

**TLDR: police departments make a lot of money from selling old evidence. So they take as many high cost possessions as they can, can almost never allow them to be returned to the owner.**
I'd appreciate it, It seems like every time I travel there we find at least two firearms, I don't mind finding the old ones because I get to keep those, It's the newer ones that I'm worried about.
*That's* what makes no sense and frankly comes off as lazy on the part of Flint PD.
You may be touching on the reason there is a high violent crime rate in Flint... I bet the cities with low crime rates respond to you quickly and curtiously?
I found 2 railroad lamps and a railroad lantern! The one I found in Flint the metal was just breaking apart in my hands so I took the metal off the glass and the glass is perfectly intact, not even a scratch!  

I'll message you a few photos, they are super cool
I bring most the firearms over to GRPD, I just get nervous driving across the state with random firearms with visible numbers and few of them still operable
It's a known fact in I believe it was Baltimore that some officers would throw guns they confiscate into dumpsters or keep the guns they confiscate so they don't have to do more paperwork 

It's extremely unlikely I found a gun that was thrown in by an officer, It's not impossible 😂
It's always about money.
I know I can open carry with a "registered pistol" but cannot buy a pistol from an FFL dealer, only from "private sales". I cannot possess, transport or carry a pistol with no registration or paper trail from my understanding. Please correct me if I'm wrong on any of that. None of those pistols I find belonged to me at any point until AFTER I got a police report stating I'm the new owner of said firearm.
Law enforcement in this country is such a fucking joke. A bunch of lazy pigs that won't think twice about magdumping a homeless man, but groans and moans about paperwork and expenses like a miserly office manager.
I would absolutely reach out to State PD, but the issue is State PD It cannot give you the chance to claim a firearm you found even if it comes back clean. Because there has been some guns that I absolutely wanted to keep that I found in the river, but I had to turn it in because it was relatively new. Like that PX4 Storm. I wanted to keep it so bad but I turned it in over to my local station and I was super lucky to get that back 6 weeks later because all they can do is run the serial number.
Magnet fishing in person is even cooler. I've met some amazing people while magnet fishing, including the people I used to watch back when magnet fishing was starting to gain traction on YouTube!
Exactly, some of those guns people lose it get stolen are memories, or extremely expensive pieces. I found a few very valuable guns. Well very valuable back when they worked 😂
Counties and municipalities often use state crime labs anyway. So if you pass it off to your county, they'll prob in turn give it to the state police to process it for ballistic, fingerprint, or touch DNA evidence. If you give it to the state they'll likely put it through the lab and then forward the case (if there even is one) to the relevant local authorities if it's not their prosecutorial purview.
Working as a deputy, I’ve seen equal motivation from both MSP and County law enforcement to take cases and make arrests. City law enforcement, not so much.
The genessee county sheriff isn't one of the insane ones, or at least he doesn't do it publicly.
also work EMS, some of the sheriff paramedics have quite an ego
How about the OCCK families as well
What did you do with the guns that you found?
"You need a toe? I can get you a toe..."
The Supreme Court has roundly rejected prior restraint
*Downtown Los Santos. I have an office near there /s
Ulvade wasnt that long ago.
Why would they do that when you can do nothing and still have power and a pension?
Drop the YouTube channel
You guy's, i feel so dumb. This is the first time the reasoning behind the lyrics made sense. 


Thank you
I'm on the other side of Michigan,  in the UP. What is the iron content like in the sand on that side of the state? I'll throw my magnet in the water here and mostly what I get is fine iron, basically magnetic sand. I find some cool stuff every now and again. Mostly fishing lures. Nothing like a gun though.
Wow, this is really interesting stuff. Thanks for sharing.
This was about 15 years ago. We were there to support a friend's band. We went to go get food for the guys in the band after thier set. We asked the guy working the door if we could leave and come back, they said yes. When we got back with the food they wouldntvlet us in. We offered to pay the cover again to get in. Door guy said he would talk to the manager. While he was gone another guy came up, grabbed us and started walking us out of the building. My friend wouldn't move and was asking what the hell was going on. As we are trying to figure out what this new guy was doing the manager came up and was like "I was going to let you in but if you are arguing with the bouncer you got to leave".

Nothing we could do so we left. I went around back to where the band was loading up to give them the food. When I was gone my friend was sitting on the curb smoking a cigarette waiting for me. The bouncer came up behind him and kicked him in the head and was like "I told you to leave, get the fuck off the property". Then started pushing him out into the street. When I came back my friend was bleeding from his head. I grabbed some shop towels from my car and we got the hell away from that shitty venue and shitty city and never looked back.
Pontiac no longer has its own police department. Oakland County Sheriff handles the city now.
My gun was stolen in Ypsilanti, Washtenaw County, and was recovered by "Metro Narcotics Enforcement Team". Got the case number and everything. She said it came up stolen so it was sent to MSP and she'd driven there that morning to grab it. 
there's always the chance their boat flipped or they lost their gun fishing.


people be dumb.
How old does a firearm have to be before you can just keep it?
Sent!
Yeah any newer gun you find is bound to be linked to some crime
Check out the docuseries "Flint Town" on Netflix. It's from 2018, but I'm sure it still resonates strongly. As others noted, OP should contact MSP when making finds in Flint.
Ionia has the fastest response time so far, the cop was there when I found a bazooka rocket 😂 

I've never had a flint officer show up when we call. Out of all the main cities I magnet fish, Lansing PD typically shows up the quickest, In 15-20 minutes. GRPD takes about half an hour, Detroit PD varies, but usually it takes them 30 minutes to an hour. Baltimore PD also shows up kind of quick. Took em 25ish minutes
Please do, that's cool as hell. Never really cared about this shit but I had a pair of kids and all of a sudden I know 20 different bird calls.
Michigan has a sales registry, not a handgun registry so only the purchase of a pistol is registered with limited exceptions. 

 MCL 28.422 requires you to acquire a LTP to possess/carry. It does not require any sales registration, only that you have had a LTP. 

Strangely enough, filling out a LTP for a pistol that you did not purchase(with limited exception) is a felony.
For ever under trained & overpaid. When you amount to nothing, fuck the locals over repeatedly👍
Definitely seems like a highly-variable YMMV thing from one place to the next. We have at least a few sheriffs who have proven themselves to be positive contributors. However, we also have Dar Leaf. Most of the others are somewhere in between. We've all seen the same be true for city police, and presumably the same is also true for state police.
You're 100% right; that one specific sheriff is a very cool guy and has been an impressive contributor to the county's communities in ways that are exceedingly rare for a cop. (He got a lot of state/regional media for his welcoming and humanistic response to the Black Lives Matter marches, which was not how many cop leaders responded.)

Unfortunately, the Genesee County Sheriff is also a rare exception in this state and country.
Crime
I'm picturing a GoT Iron Throne but with guns
There are ways, Dude. You don’t want to know.
WITH nail polish!
WAVING THE FUCKING GUN AROUND?
[Davey](https://youtu.be/TBbxlP6NXXs?si=T9dwVkgD-FM5gUy2)…?
That shit still pisses me off. They had their social media pages plastered with all the tacticool shit they were getting to 'fight crime' and play pretend soldier and then when the time came to actually, ya know, put all that 'training' and material to use they just...stood there. And did nothing. None of those people deserve to be officers anymore. They're clearly not a right fit.
That was more cowardice than laziness.
I don't really post on YouTube, but I have one, the magnetizer
I did a little bit of magnet fishing in the up as well and I didn't find a whole lot, there aren't many people up there. The population is scattered all over the place in the up
Out of curiosity what Venue? Was it the Machine Shop? I haven't been in years but they've had some shitty bouncers in the past.
Yeah over in that area they probably have a lot more guns going through the evidence room and not as many people in the evidence room and lab, so it's going to take longer for stuff to get booked compared to Grand Rapids. GRPD have quite a bit of stuff coming into their labs and everything but seems like they have more time and more resources because I get the guns that I find back pretty quick from GRPD. 

Still awesome you got it back. I still want to find a stolen gun or a gun someone lost from an accident and have it returned, I think it would be cool.
Yeah but who transports their gun in a sock cut up on a boat and accidentally loses it 🤣 

The guns would have came back stolen or reported missing unless they don't know how to report their serial 😆
It depends on what area you're in. What I've Been told by officers is any gun before 1976 I believe you could technically keep as any gun registered before 1976 were on paper record and there's a chance they can never get anything off of it. I know for a fact any guy that dates before 1898 you can keep. 

But in Michigan I've been told if we find a rifle shotgun or black powder firearm they won't want it unless it's super recently ditched. If the firearm has no visible serial nor is operable, they typically don't want it. However, all four of those guns that I included in the post are either operable or have visible numbers.
That's my philosophy, guns are too expensive to just decide to throw in a river. They are likely stolen and ditched or stolen and used.
I can relate to this. I have no interest in guns but this post is interesting because of the finds. I also follow some pretty nerdy sub reddits such as r\whatsthisbug.
Wait, why is that a felony?
I really hope he sees all of your kind comments. I worked a municipal public facing job and did really great work that went largely unrecognized. It made me so happy when a member of the community would speak lauditorily of me and my programs. I worked in animal control and sheltering. At the municipal level that is literal hell. But I got our live release rate of neonate animals up to more than 80%. Which is much higher that the national standard of 0%. Neonates are not legally obligated to be held in an animal control sense.
They didn't have that training. The Uvalde School PD chief was signing off on certs without actually making his officers attend the training. State mandated training, at times. Some officers hadn't been properly recertified in years, if ever at all. 

This is a central finding in both the Texas DPS report and the FBI report. They simply were not prepared or trained for this because of negligence. 

Also, not as relevant, but I had a Texan the other day deny that the shit happened and accused me of lying, saying that it actually happened in my state of MO. So I don't think shit gonna change
**FAKE NEWS!!!**

Texas police didn't just stand there in the parking lot and do nothing.  They arrested the parents who were trying to rush into the school to save their children while they were being brutally slaughtered.
Uvalde was a clusterfuck because nobody wanted to take charge of the situation so while they jerked themselves off for an hour, kids and teachers died.
Hell yeah
It sure was. I have been to 100s of shows over the last 25+ years and never had an experience that bad. I would understand if we were being belligerent or unreasonable, but we weren't drinking that night (had a long drive home) and tried to follow the rules the best we could.
All of Reddit: we lost our guns in a boating accident! 

You: ... can you pinpoint where, exactly? It's my time to shine! 

:D
> Yeah but who transports their gun in a sock cut up on a boat and accidentally loses it

Jesus, yea don't get any more obvious than that. That's like straight up out of The Godfather.
jeez, like you never heard of a glock in a sock
I hope you’re not firing these guns to deem them operable… not shitting on this whole operation but that seems ill-advised.
Training my ass.  An armed illiterate hillbilly probably would have stepped in faster than those clowns did.
That's kinda my point. They talked a big talk but when it came time to actually put their money where their mouth is they failed. Spectacularly. 

>I had a Texan the other day deny that the shit happened and accused me of lying

That wouldn't surprise me man. Conservative MO these days seem to be to just ignore any evidence to the contrary and tow that party line, logic, intelligence, or any sort of integrity be damned, those things are for Democrats.
You know they told themselves they didn’t need the stupid mandated training because they were such awesome badasses
Riiiightttt.. detained the parents who had more balls than they did.
They had no trouble cuffing the parents trying to get in save their kids though.
The machine shop 😭 absolute classic lmaooo I've heard they've gotten a lot better recently but not exactly the place I'd go to for a good show LOL flint crackheads are the worst man, sorry you had to experience the bad aspects of Flint
🤣
Nope, I prefer to keep them inoperable so they can be souvenirs. I only wanted to try and clean one of them up because I think it would be cool to carry a gun I found in the river that I was able to legally claim, but so far it's been risky to restore any of them to firing condition
No, it's because the chief is a bumbling idiot who shouldn't have even been a cop let alone in charge of a school district pd
The Satanic Temple congregations set up Yule Goat at Michigan Capitol
Last night members of The Satanic Temple-West
Michigan, Detroit, and Capitol Area Michigan
congregations set up the annual Yule Goat display at the Michigan Capitol.
The Yule Goat stands as a symbol of religious plurality and diversity. This is the fifth year The Satanic Temple Michigan Congregations have observed the holidays through the Yule Goat display. After which it will be taken and ceremoniously burned in a destruction ritual that centers around the concept of alleviating pain and suffering through ritualistic burning. 
The display can be found on display on the northeastern yard at the state capitol throughout the holiday season.
Y’all can stop reporting this thread - it’s not discriminatory & not breaking any rules, and it’s staying up.
As a Christian I am neither offended nor challenged by this.  Live and let live.
Festivus for the rest of us!
Saw this post and thought "that's Daddy Bones posting isn't it" yes, yes it is. ❤️
Maybe we should get in a race with Sweden to see who can build the biggest yule goat?
I would prefer a world where religious symbols aren't put on government property but if we're going to do it then stuff like this absolutely needs to be put up
665 comments before I made this one. I could not resist
Dope
Anyone else think this picture they chose to use is awful? I’m having a terrible time making out what any of it is
Just wanna say that the overall vibe check has been immaculate. Thank you everyone for the love and support. You guys are all amazing. Hail yourselves and I can't wait to share the future victories of the TST congregations of Michigan.  
Hail Michigan!  
Hail Satan!

Live footage at the Michigan Capitol.
Woo hoo! Shout out to my goat loving fellow Michiganders! 🐐🙌🏻
This comment section is full of people who haven’t done a minute of research on The Satanic Temple and what they stand far. 

Though I suppose that’s the point, from my understanding part of why the Satanic Temples brands itself as such is to prove how many people make judgements and assumptions based off of other’s beliefs without ever trying to understand 

The Satanic Temple isn’t about counter culture, it’s about acceptance and love, despite what they believe.
Christian rightwing: "That's sacrilege, we ought to pour gas on that satanic icon and light it on fire"

Satanic church: "Here's a match"
That's metal as fuck yet weirdly pretty. A+ 10/10 for the Mitten Satanists.
Ottawa County would like one of their own, please
Love this. 

I actually want to see & appreciate what ALL the organized religions do for the winter/new year.

These sculptures by the satanic temple are really to provoke the intolerance of others who would prefer to control you than let you be different
Merry Christmas! Happy Holidays! A great Yule! And hail Satan!
Crossing my fingers that some christian zealot burns it and TST thanks them for taking part in their satanic temple ceremony.
Anyone got instructions on how to build a Yule Goat? This would be a nice edition to my theme. I’ve still got my skull wreath up from Halloween (it’s a pastel goth wreath).
That's a baad photo.
Religion is so annoying..
As a Christian I just shrug and say "oh well." It's not hurting me. Freedom of religion means also *all* or *no* religion.
Nice
I support the Yule Goat anywhere else in public where other religions are allowed to set displays. (Ideally we wouldn't be putting religious anything anywhere public).
Funny enough, the Puritans [banned Christmas](https://www.history.com/news/when-massachusetts-banned-christmas) in the US and the UK for being too Pagan.
White Christian supremacists strike again
Religious freedom
You go guys! Mom's for Liverty were going to come but they couldn't get out of jail in time. Lmao
This is beautiful, I love displays of diverse celebrations. 

Out of curiosity, what is the difference between the Satanic observation of Yule and the Pagan one? I know Yule can be somewhat of a generic and even non-denominational term, but I'd love to know more details of how TST celebrates.
hope it fairs better than the iowa capitol one.
Wont be touched.
Looks rad, man. 🤘
I’m going to have to go see that!
Watch, someone will knock it down this statue/ display  who previously rallied against " war statues" being knocked down in southern states and religious freedom.
I wanna pet it
They are the real heroes here.
happy yule, may our state and all its inhabitants prosper ☺️
Who doesn't love a Yule Goat?!?
Damn that thing looks sick
Hail Satan
Beautiful
hell yeah, michigan keeps winning. proud that we can keep this going somewhere at least.
Detroit metro here. This shit is way cooler than Christian/Muslim/Jewish shit. I still don't give af because I have real hobbies, but rock on Satanists!

P.S. - maybe should have based your entire personality on something NOT based in religion. People don't understand and they just assume you're devil worshipers, you might even attract some freaks that also don't get it, but I digress. Anyway, rock on dudes!
tbh really pretty
Nice, good job folks! Just one small complaint, can we make it prettier next time? Just a little?
Saving this post for later because I know it'll be an interesting read.
Hell yeah 🤘
Yesssss
Happy Capricorn season
Tis a beautiful goat
If all religions were this way the world might be a safer place.
More like GOAT, amirite
As a not Christian, Idgaf.
It's... beautiful🥹 *(sniffle)*
Oh fuck yeah I'll have to bring him a little gift
So is there going to be an outdoor orgy after the burning of the Yule goat ritual ?
I hope this becomes a yearly tradition, like our own satanic version of the Gävle goat.
I love it. Hope it stays up
Amazing everyone, all the local atheist can at least celebrate this
Yule goat goes hard, I’d pay for a mini figurine or a stuffed animal of that thing
Neat!
Gotta own the MAGs
Religious freedom
If it ever drops a Yule Goat Log I will watch it on television.
Good
As a person whose beliefs align with TST, I think it’s beautiful. If other religious symbols are put up on land belonging to a state or city, all should have the right to representation.

I’d go to Lansing to see it if I could, but I don’t have a car or gas money.
hell yeah hail satan
I appreciate the inclusivity and diversity
Trans flag sighted :3 💖🏳️‍⚧️
Cool! Do it again.

(Saint Joseph MI)
Cool.
hail sithis
Burning the Julbock? Now that's a tradition I can get behind.
Hail Satan!
Awesome
And?  If you set up one religious symbol then they should allow them all.
Goodness. Where did they get petunias in December?
Amusing!
Very cool!
Love to see it
I live in MI. Have worked in the capitol. Our senator said something to the effect that while he does not support the satanic church, he welcomes their display.
I want to burn a yule log in their honor this Christmas, bravo
Yule Mule would have been better
Yule logs for everyone!

Everyone wants a log.
Magnificent
Based
The democrats support the Satanic Temple
so apparently if you want to be famous on fox news, go destroy this for jesus
[deleted]
It's beautiful
Gorgeous
All Hail YULE GOAT!

awesome!
💀
...is it Christmas Eve or Christmas morning when we set it on fire?
I think next time they need to hire security lol 😂 start a go fund me
LOL
I believe if you're a true Christian, you shouldn't even be celebrating Christmas with the tree etc.  There isnt even any evidence Jesus was born on Dec 25th.  Instead they're gonna focus on this yule goat and get all angry, even though their own holiday traditions are not biblical.


The Catholic church just took pagan holidays, and converted them into "Christian" ones.  You can even look into easter, and its roots tying to Ishtar the fertility goddess of Babylon, whose symbols were eggs and a bunny, hmm. Everything has been perverted in this world.

Too many people profess to be christion, but are wolves in sheep's clothing, turning people from Jesus.  It was foretold, so not surprising.

Jeremiah 101Hear what the LORD says to you, O house of Israel.2This is what the LORD says: "Do not learn the ways of the nations or be terrified by signs in the sky, though the nations are terrified by them.3For the customs of the peoples are worthless; they cut a tree out of the forest, and a craftsman shapes it with his chisel.4They adorn it with silver and gold; they fasten it with hammer and nails so it will not totter.
[removed]
Not offended, I just think it looks ugly convoluted mess haha
Oh dang, sorry I missed it this year!

Hail Satan!
I need to see that goat’s face. Please?
So brave, So edgy 🥴
As an atheist, I am offended by this.
So Michigan is satanic?
Jesus is Lord!  Trigger time!
As an atheist, what a stupid waste of time. But, nobody asked my opinion.

![gif](giphy|9Dk9qjfFf3mVpin1sK|downsized)
Cringe
It's annoying enough when the Christians steal all the pagan stuff, do the Satanists have to do it too?
Imagine unironically being a member of the satanic temple. I hope to never experience the sights and smells of dozens of fedoras and neckbeard body odor.
So glad I don't live in lansing
Oh look, it’s a bunch of losers desperately trying to be relevant.
The ST isn't a religion, doesn't claim to be so, and shouldn't be treated as such.

That said, gross and I hate it. It's like making the KKK a religion to justify burning crosses on state grounds to pwn the blacks. The fact people enjoy glorifying evil makes me not trust the people that are supposed to be my neighbors.
Satanist are just vindictive athiest that use anti christian imagery to elicit a respone like what happen iowa
I’m seeing a lot of unsafe material for burning but sure

Don’t forget to buy an EV to save the planet 🤦🏻‍♀️
The bible warns of false teachers many times.  It's pretty evident nowadays with the prosperity teachers, televangelists, mega churches.  They are not true christian, and worship mammon.  Christianity is supposed to be about a personal relationship with Jesus., and follow his teachings.  The Catholic Church is also a farce.  Praying to saints, Mary, etc, in addition to so much abuse.  That is not biblical, nor is confessing your sins in a little box.  They will get their just rewards when they leave this place.
Most modern "christians" go to churce once a week, but  don't reflect the teachings of the bible in their life.  I can see why so many people are turned off from these places.  Jesus warned that many would come in his name, false teachers.  My advice is to read the book for yourself, and pray for discernment in this crazy world.  In Revelation, seven churches were talked about, and only one of them, Ephesus, was doing things correctly.  God gave us all free will, and its up to each of us to either follow him or "do what thou wilt", as Aliester Crowley stated.

Galatians 1:6-9
I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel— not that there is another one, but there are some who trouble you and want to distort the gospel of Christ. But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed. As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, let him be accursed.

John 14:6
Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.

2 Timothy 4: 3-4
For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; and they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.
Gross
That's because you get it. Hail you.
We started america with the idea of freedom of religion being a big motivation.  People seem to have forgot that because many interpret it to be "freedom to be christian" and nothing more.
That’s the Holiday Spirit!
Man just imagine how the world would look like if everyone would just live and let live
You're smart. This is basically a trap. I say that as an atheist myself. They are trying to make a point on how so many Christians demand a level of respect that they refuse to give. It works every time but we want to live in a world full of Christian's like you. Those that don't feel they have a right to our souls. You are more than welcome to follow any religion that you want. I support you in that. It's the forcing it on others that give Christian it's a bad bad name 🤷‍♀️
That's probably because you actually follow Christ's teachings which basically boils down to

Treat EVERYONE with love and respect. No fucking exceptions.
Thank you. A real Christian on the internet.  👍
You're not offended by an inanimate object??
Congratulations on beginning your journey to secularism!
Certainly not challenged over here
You are not Christian. You only think you are.
Also keep your religion to yourself.
I've got a lot of problems with you. And you're going to hear allllll about it.
Shit!

Due to a glaring oversight on the part of the author, Chrismahanukwanzakah shall henceforth be known as Chrismahanukwanzak**us.**

Thank you for your consideration, and we now return you to your regular scheduled program, already in progress.
Giddy up
Tantrick Brewing has a Festivus celebration Saturday, see you there!
I am flattered.💜
Lmao! Love it. Would be a wonderful challenge. Except herding Satanists is like herding cats aka very hard to do and I don't think that's a battle we michiganders can win.
I think that’s the point. They put this up here as a way to say “look, if you’re going to put *that* one up, then we’re gonna put *this* one up.” The Satanic temple exists as a means of promoting the separation of church and state, and as a means of highlighting hypocrisy when people inevitably get mad about it.
So does the Satanic Temple.
Other side of the coin is when a municipality moves to ban ALL flags/symbols except for USA/State flags in a clear measure to simply ban gay pride/lgbtq flags (in the case of Hamtramck).
YEP!

And make sure your religious (likely Trumper) family members know it.

You want to mix YOUR religion with OUR state? Well, this is a democracy. No special treatment.
If we must have religious displays in the halls of government, this is the only acceptable way. 

I’d rather have a government totally free of religion, but it’s either accept all religions or just state that you want a theocracy.

Under the current rules, I openly welcome Christians to also put their display in the courthouse, while they also have their church with a nativity and the entire world decorates themselves for a Christian holiday. I’ll never touch a Christian display because it’s their religious freedom to have it and I’m not a theocratic shitheel.

Love it
I too make statues out of seaweed.
It looked like a Pinata to me at first
So, how does one participate in the observance of the yule goat burning? Now, this sounds like a Christmas tradition I can get behind.
I wish there was fire, it was cold as hell yesterday

We love our goats.
Um, phrasing folks.
Porque no los dos?
They're literally a troll church
Solve et Coagula  
As Above So Below  
We really like dualistic concepts.
We looked into doing a display on Ottawa County. Ran into issues with either guidelines we couldn't work with or areas just altogether not allowing displays.  
However, we are looking to share our Satansim with the residents of Ottawa County and any leads or info on how we can better achieve that is welcome.
Then you will also need this [https://youtu.be/89lq2TxKg68?si=vv4KiHhMtDvvnR62](https://youtu.be/89lq2TxKg68?si=vv4KiHhMtDvvnR62) to learn to pronounce 


Thor and his goats, Tanngrisnir (Gap-Tooth) and Tanngnjóstr (Tooth-Grinder). These two goats pulled Thor’s chariot and provided food every evening by being slaughtered only to rise again the following morning.
Happy Sol Invictus.  
May you celebrate health and prosperity.
Hail Satan!
Hail Satan! Hail thyself!
I understand that sentiment, but i really hope that doesn't happen.
The TST probably has a time and place scheduled for the apparent ritual sacrifice goat pyre thing (I am likely using gloriously wrong terms). On top of vandalism charges, and fire on capital grounds, and an assumed whole lot of legal headache, like it would be crushing to the folks that would actually be participating because that is their community thing they get to do once a year
In swedish, but from about halfway in it shows the full process of making one:
https://youtube.com/watch?v=aUthFTklIe0&feature=shared
We should make a religion that’s not annoying.
That's a good attitude and I appreciate you. May your Christmas be merry.
So the official observance of TST for the Solstice is Sol Invictus. But West Michigan began recognizing Yule before we made Sol Invictus official, and we just kept with the theme because we love it.  
Ultimately, we just view Yule as another solstice celebration and the Yule Goat fits because Satanism has an affinity for goats. The way we observe Yule will be similar to how pagans celebrate but without adherence to supernatural or mythical claims.
What happened there was actually pretty cool; that guy's blind rage totally backfired as he rocketed awareness of Satanic Temple's activities into the news cycle at a national level.
Iowa did fine. The damage caused was easily fixed. Our monuments are typically built to be repaired easily because we are prepared for vandalism. But I'm in contact with Iowa (since I'm on a regional committee and Iowa is in my region, I'm in good communication with what Iowa has been up to.) and they did fine. They rebuilt their statue and held a beautiful ritual to celebrate the success of their display. Hail Iowa!
[deleted]
The Satanic Church has been around a lot longer than the Confederacy too. Hell, that statue has only been there for about 4 years less than the existence of the Confederacy.
Sadly the artist who built the goat for the first several years passed away and we are having to teach ourselves how to build it through trial and error.  We did make progress, but...  Yeah, next year should be stronger, faster, prettier.
It's prettier in person, I promise.
There's a nice glitter to the paint, and the flowers on black look really nice go visit and see for yourself!  
But as my friend stated, the person who used to spearhead the creation of the goat is no longer with us, and we are learning and sharing this knowledge as we go.
To cold for outdoor orgies my friend.  
Most of us prefer our orgies in warmth.

We love and respect the trans community! I'm glad trans people are here:)
Hell yes! We are comprised of members of various gender identities, expressions, and sexualities. Trans folx have become victim of the new age "satanic panic" so naturally many migrate to our groups. We do various rituals to affirm people's own identities and have initiated fundraisers that benefit LGBTQIA friendly organizations. Gender non-conforming types are always safe with us.

That's exactly the point.

I spoke with our flower guy and he said Meijer.

Hail Satan
*please don't wreck our goat*
Nothing here has to do with Christians, get the fuck out of here and learn some basic dignity and respect.
I hope it is flammable since they plan to burn it after the holidays.
"Looks Flammable"   
I mean, as the description says, it's entire purpose is to be burned, so.. I'd certainly hope so.
I mean, Christians like to put a method of execution on display constantly...  Seems more edgy to me.
Triggered you enough to get you to comment. So it is not not edgy as the kids say.
Michigan is a State, where people of all faiths reside.
Trigger time?🤦‍♀️
My dude please stop looking for arguments, it's not healthy.
/r/whoosh
So you want all of your government to not have a separation of church and state? You want laws based on Christian beliefs?
Why
\*cough\* you're confusing The Satanic Temple with The Proud Boys.
I know, Christians are so sad.
Perhaps all religious decorations should be removed then so that no one needs to be uncomfortable.
“Stands as a symbol of religious plurality and diversity.” “…destruction ritual that centers around the concept of alleviating pain and suffering.”

So what part of this tradition is glorifying evil to you?
Sorry, how is the Satanic Temple like the KKK? I really want to hear your thought process on this.
You do know that the first amendment protects The Satanic Temple by also reinforcing the concept of freedom from religion as well, right? I don't see how the ideas of respecting your neighbors, accepting individuals for who they are, and loving all people is the same as being called a KKK member.
The satanic temple was basically created to piss off people like you and it's working. That's hilarious.

![gif](giphy|RG4IXFG1YmLOU)
Head in the sand over here thinks this is actually about Satan lol these people are willfully ignorant trying to tell everyone else they are the problem
Uh, Christians have been glorifying evil for around 2000 years.
I was hoping for a troll until I saw the subs this user is active in. A catholic. It all makes sense. 

Anyway, stay mad because the Satanic Temple exists to combat the religious tyranny yall want to impose on us.
It most certainly is, it’s just a nontheistic religion. And just as silly as any other religion.

Lol, you mad and it has literally zero effect on your life. Hilarious.

> The ST isn't a religion, doesn't claim to be so, and shouldn't be treated as such.

You're right! They're a bunch of constitutionalists pointing out the hypocrisy of a country that preaches separation of church and state and freedom of religion but then puts nativity scenes on their state capitols. Or incentivizes marriage with tax breaks when marriage WAS supposed to be a religious thing.
Glorifying evil?  What does the ST do that glorifies evil?  I mean, it’s not like they pray to the likeness of someone being tortured to death while nailed to a big wooden cross.
Waaaa, you believe in the wrong kind of magic… waaaa

~Maestro
You started off so strong, then got to the kkk... That's not remotely close, as the kkk is a vile group based on oppression, hatred, and murder.  The satanic temple uses the boogey man from other religions to point out the ridiculousness of it all and to get a rise out of the overly pious.  They don't, however, condone any hatred, oppression, or murder.  Quite the opposite.
You're projecting your Christian understanding onto Satanism. It exists to push back against the "Christian love" and infinite redemption that you believe. It exists to make you mad that Satanists are good people. You're mad because you don't understand.
Hahahahahahahahahhauahahaha I knew I could count on you or Yzerman to come here with your grinch powers
Yeah this goat skull is gross. They should have something more normal like a half-naked bloody dude being tortured or something.

It's only vindictive if you're a hypocrite, otherwise it's just cheeky.
Please, no one asked to be preached at here. What christians have decided to believe is not the reality/truth/fact that should have any implications on anyone else's lives.  You believe in christianity, that's your choice and your deal. Do not come here and try to tell the rest of us your beliefs are the actual way of the world. They are just your decisions and restrictions.

Yes, it’s much like a teenager going emo and complaining about how oppressed they are when they are asked not to wear makeup to their graduation
Even better, they’re not offended by a symbol.
I've lost my train of thought
Doesn't need to be satanists! Just anyone who wants to build a giant yule goat like the one in Gavle. :D
I'll say! I am a member of the temple, a member of the west MI TST FB group, still didn't know this was happening. Super sad to have missed it going up.
I thought you were herding Santas for a second and got lost.
it's 100% the point... satanists don't actually believe in satan... it's just a counter to highlight why you need the separation. Trying through the years to take stuff like this down because there needs to be that separation has not always worked, so by forcing the other side to put it before the courts, they're forced to make a proper ruling. Either it's all gotta go or you gotta deal with devil goat or whatever.
Tbh I absolutely prefer if the government sets up every winter holiday display.

When you have all different kinds it looks more like a representation of the community and citizens anyways.
It's also just for pointing out the hypocrisy of religious folks. They'll tell you that this yule goat is evil, satanic, and literally the end of the world for what it symbolizes because it "looks like evil/death" while they literally idolize one of the most brutal torture methods ever devised, crucifixion.
> “look, if you’re going to put that one up

Which one is *"that"* one?
Literally the only reason they put the displays up. The displays are protests against other displays that preceded them. They are never the first to put one up because they would prefer that no one did.
Fun theory I have about Hamtramck: I’m pretty sure that they were trying to stop all the middle eastern flags and the removal of the pride flags was an added bonus. they knew that most of the Muslims weren’t supportive of the LGBT community, soo they tricked em into thinking it was to get rid of the pride flags and killed two birds with one stone.
>I’d rather have a government totally free of religion

You mean like the one we're *supposed* to have?
Thank you!
So cold. Although, I think it was rightfully earned. A good winter evening to herald our erection.
mR. pIcKlEs! gOoD bOy!
No. They are a church that wants what's best for people. Read the 7 tenets of Satan at the very least before making assumptions.
All churches are troll churches. But TST is the only one who is honest about it, and trolls for responsible reasons.
How so
I'm sure Commissioner Joe Moss and the rest of the Ottawa Impact folks would love to hear about the important of religion in government from y'all.
If you make any headway r/Ottawacounty would love to hear about it.

Hail Gein!
This just reminds me of the irony that historically, Jewish people are pretty insular and keep their religion to themselves, which ended up with the communities they lived in or near having an easy scapegoat when things went wrong with crops or weather or plague or whatnot because there were these people over there keeping to themselves and doing their own thing, so it _must_ be _their_ fault that bad things are happening to everybody because _we just don't know what they're up to over there._

Tl;Dr - you might not want to make a religion that doesn't annoy people. They'll think you're up to something.
With cocaine and video games! (I don't care for black jack or hookers)
And yours as well.
That is awesome! Do you have any resources on how to properly celebrate Yule?
oh great! i saw theirs and thought it l9oked lovely and was mad it got wrecked im glad it was repaired. hail iowa indeed!
literally. might think its full of demons and evil to touch
As an FYI: there are two separate entities. 

The Satanic Temple and the Church of Satan. The Temple is the organization that is responsible for displays like this.
You're aware the Satanic Temple is really just Humanism cloaked in the guise of religion right? 

I. One should strive to act with compassion and empathy toward all creatures in accordance with reason.

II. The struggle for justice is an ongoing and necessary pursuit that should prevail over laws and institutions.

III. One’s body is inviolable, subject to one’s own will alone.

Five of your so called "Ten Commandments" are literally how to worship your god correctly. I'll stick with my seven. Happy holidays 🥳
No that would be you, otaku boy.

Huh. Nice color.
Remember your sins will be accounted for 🤡
How does my post lack dignity or respect?  Can i not express my opinions on the internet, if I don't like it? Why are you so butthurt?  Is this not a display by Lucien one eyed Greaves, to piss off the christians?  If Christians weren't displaying their stuff, the Satanic temple wouldn't even exist.
Maybe they'll plan on burning it in one night but it'll be so inflammable it'll take eight days to burn and we'll get a fun holiday crossover episode.
So edgy
I actually don't care either way. It's a non story. Ohhh look at the edge guys. So lame.
Everyone be sure to downvote me quickly. We wouldn’t want someone with sense talking about this nothing burger of a story. 👏
No, I'll never deprive anyone with good intentions their space in the public domain. The ST is, by its nature, a bad faith entity and deserves neither recognition or respect. It exists ONLY to sow division and anger between people.
They're not going to, that's the funny part.
The Satanic Temple venerates Satan through its namesake. It uses the moniker of the most evil entity in the Christian religion to deliberately and intentionally inspire anger and revulsion from that community. A KKK cult would likewise use evil entities to inspire anger and revulsion from the black community. The intention is to make people uncomfortable and to remove them from public spaces.

The ST wants religion removed from public spaces. The KKK wants black people removed from public spaces. The only difference is that some people support one kind of bigotry over another.
If your neighbor hung a picture of Jefferson Davis in front of his black neighbors house and said "I'm just venerating a visionary man, I don't hate blacks, I just love whiteness." You'd rightly call BS. They'd just be using the veneer of religion as a shield to be jerks to people they don't like.

That's what the ST is, a bunch of trolls using the ultimate evil of the Abrahamic religions to throw it in their face. You don't glorify Satan out of love for people, you do it out of hatred for people.
All the Christian men i work with are getting so mad about all the satanic temple things this year and it's cracking me up. I love it.
If your organization exists to incite anger, why would you be surprised when people get angry? Congrats, people now are even more divided and angry at each other, goal accomplished.
It's almost kind of pathetic  to want to annoy people ? I guess not in the eyes of you people though lol. Most people of faith I know never go out of their way to fuck with others that don't believe what they believe. Pretty lame tbh
>I was hoping for a troll until I saw the subs this user is active in. A catholic. It all makes sense.

So you're just going to be a bigot then? You're lucky I'm not any other religion or that kind of rhetoric would get you banned.
It is not. It's a troll group, it exists to spark anger and division and it accomplishes that. Religions exist to promote an ideal or a truth beyond the physical, the ST does not, and does not proport to. It is not divinely inspired and it is not extra physical. 

It is no more a religion than a rotary club.
>They're a bunch of constitutionalists pointing out the hypocrisy of a country that preaches separation of church and state and freedom of religion but then puts nativity scenes on their state capitols.

How does that violate separation of church and state? Is the state house forcing people to convert, is it subsidizing a church, is it denying funds to other church's? Or are anti-religious bigots just looking to spread their own misery around.

>Or incentivizes marriage with tax breaks when marriage WAS supposed to be a religious thing.

Or there's a cross cultural awareness that marriages tend to create more stable environments for raising and rearing children. Which is why official atheistic governments such as China still subsidize married couples despite having no religious affiliation.

The fact that atheists in the west conflate Christianity with a virtually universally recognized good that is monogamous marriage doesn't exactly dunk on Christians.
>What does the ST do that glorifies evil?

Named themselves after Satan?
>That's not remotely close, as the kkk is a vile group based on oppression, hatred, and murder.

So, like Satan...which the organization named itself after.

>They don't, however, condone any hatred, oppression, or murder.

Technically, the KKK doesn't either. They did something of a rebranding so that now they promote themselves as, more or less, a white people interest group. Naturally people see this and realize it's a bunch of BS.

Just as the ST doesn't 'state' that they hate Christians, it's kind of...in the name.
>It exists to push back against the "Christian love" and infinite redemption that you believe.

I mean...yeah. If you push back against love, that's hate. If you push back against redemption, that's trying to make someone irredeemable.

That's, definitionally, evil. Willing the bad of the other is evil.
>Eat shit you fucking christofascist.

If that's your choir, it's starting to look like I'm the reasonable one here.
Wow, you're unpleasant.
Lol, to think either side cares about the populace! Trump is a narcissist Kaballist,  and Joe is a creepy child sniffer who can't make complete sentences anymore.  Two wings of the same bird...divide and conquer.
Daily reminder that mentally unwell people like this exist everywhere and are capable of voting.

I didn’t say which holiday 🤷‍♂️
Damn. I'm sorry you missed it. I made multiple posts for the event page and shared to discord. Facebook is just brutal at burying anything important we are trying to share.
> satanists don't actually believe in satan

To be specific, members of the The Satanic Temple (those who are putting up these figures) do not Worship Satan. They are a non-thiest organization whose aim is to abuse the loopholes created by large scale religion to help out people, mostly those who have been abused due to large scale religion.

The Church of Satan is a legit religion that does worship Satan. Although ironically they prefer to stay out of politics and are known for not abusing religious loopholes, including paying taxes.

They are completely different and have no correlation to each other.
Don’t forget eating the flesh and drinking the blood of Christ. Talk about ghoulish
It’s also worth noting that Christ’s message is that he will return and end the world, judge everyone on their faith, kill all the unbelievers with fire, and reward his faithful with eternal life in his new kingdom. That’s all love and hugs for Christians, but it’s a threat of genocide to everyone else, and not very nice. The Satanic Temple, on the other hand, does not espouse any kind of death for anyone, regardless of religious affiliation. So who is evil, the ones promising death, or the ones being threatened with death?
*crucifixion
It’s not idolizing crucifixion. Being Christian doesn’t require you to be crucified it’s honoring the pain and suffering the man the religion is founded after. That’s like saying Jews idolize plagues because they celebrate sedar. It’s honoring the suffering of their ancestors and former religious leaders.
it’s not idolized. jesus christ was crucified just because people didn’t like him. it just so happens that’s how he died and we therefore have to talk about it. there is no idolizing it.
This is what reddit atheism does to your brain
I'm happy to enlighten them.

My sins are nothing compared to the churches
Also, if you want to have the balls to bring up religions not exciting well Christianity has stolen more rituals, rites, symbols, and beliefs from other religions then any other has even come close to. If it wasn't for hundreds of other faiths, and billions of stolen lives, Christianity wouldn't exist.
You're going to die sad and alone.
Problem is we sometimes make the fire too big and have to take the whole ritual a few steps back because we of course get a little excited with flammables.  
It tends to be in our nature.
Fun fact, inflammable just means it'll burn easier than a flammable
Yep. Can't be anti Christian without being edgy....
Ah yes, your voluntary response to a subject is a evidence that it didn't illicit a reaction from you, bullet proof.
Ah yes, your voluntary response and childish insults are very much proof that it is a nothing burger that will illicit no response from anyone. Breathtaking.
>The ST is, by its nature, a bad faith entity and deserves neither recognition or respect. 

As opposed to the Catholic church that spent decades hiding the sexual abuse of children and only stopped the practice of moving predator priests around, not because it was immoral, but because they got caught. That's not even touching on their older history, which is... well *slightly* blemished. 

I'm curious what the ST has done that is worse than your church. I mean, for the ST to be considered so irredeemable in comparison to Catholicism, they must have perpetrated some pretty heinous acts, right?

Right?
>The ST is, by its nature, a bad faith entity

Congratulations! You don't actually know what you're talking about
[removed]
Why not go pick up a hobby like a normal person? Why waste your own time trying to crusade on a tiny subreddit?
I think it exists more to expose the existing intolerance and hypocrisy of many religious folks, as well as the inappropriate nature of religious displays on public grounds.

The division and anger seem to be from the people taking the bait.
So christians taking away rights are acting in good faith?
TST exists to remind religious wackos that if they want to push their faith into public spaces, then they must be willing to endure other faiths being pushed into their face as well. The Satanists largely do a better job than Jesus ever could of teaching America Christians that they must act towards others as they would have others act towards them.
Mfs won't ever understand this lol. "Satanism is about the worship of yourself" head ass it's literally bad faith as you sad otherwise they wouldn't have taken the main evil entity from Christianity and made it into soemrhing lol
Whoa there, Stretch Armstrong.

First of all, free speech means you can name your thing whatever you like as long as it doesn't violate copyright laws. Ask Norma Jean.

Second, you're really doing a puff piece on the KKK here to ignore what they're actually about. How you described the KKK is like saying Hitler was an artist who didn't want Jewish people in public spaces. When's the last time the Satanic Temple lynched anyone, bombed a church, or terrorized someone in their home?

Third, the Satanic Temple explicitly does not want religion removed from public spaces. Them doing this sort of thing is putting religion is public spaces. Unless when you say "religion" you just mean "Christianity" and by "removed from public spaces" you just mean "not granted exclusive rights to be in public spaces over other religions, violating the establishment clause of the US Constitution."

There's no bigotry in arguing that the United States shouldn't favor any one religion over the others and that public spaces should be made available to practices of one faith if we're not going to include others.
So, how many Christians have the Satanic Temple people lynched? I assume there’s a pretty significant body count if they’re just like the KKK.
That is some serious mental gymnastics. You should join the Olympics.
>The ST wants **religion** removed from public spaces. The KKK wants black **people** removed from public spaces. The only difference is that some people support one kind of bigotry over another.

Satan isn't real though

And TST's tenets are significantly more moral than the 10 commandments
My dog! Someone turn on the lights cuz it seems to be pretty DIM in here!
These displays are for the sole purpose of pointing out your hypocrisy and showing the world what your lot is really all about. Control. That's it. That's all your religion is, a tool to control others for your own personal gain and satisfaction. 

Even now, you're trying to tell us what the Satanic Temple thinks and believes. Shut up, you don't get to control this story. This display either has nothing to do with you or it points out just how nasty and stupid your religion's views are. The more you talk, the more you discredit the thing you claim to be sacred.
Jefferson Davis advocated for enslavement and punishment of black folks. Not once did the devil/ Satan ever advocate for the killing of people, enslavement of others, striking your wife, plucking out eyeballs, etc; those were all advocated by your so-called ever-loving God
Didn’t take you long to compare christians in this country to slaves. Good work.
![gif](giphy|9MFsKQ8A6HCN2)
You know who incited anger? Jesus Christ. He espoused a philosophy that was unacceptable to the rulers and the state religion.

So they did a thing.

And you are still okay with government choosing what religions are good to go?

Maybe Catholics should start showing some tolerance towards others before they start expecting it back.
Sounds like you’re the only one being divisive and angry at people
Ask that same question to the fundamentalists
It doesn't exist to incite anger, it exists to make you think critically about why you believe what you believe and to help you recognize the impact that your beliefs and actions have on the whole of society.
No one is surprised, my dude. They’re laughing at how predictable and wrong you are. They exist to piss people like you off because you’re a bunch of hypocrites, and it’s working, and it’s glorious. Happy holidays!
You realize they're still an actual religion that protect people, right?

They're still here for a reason. 🙄
Bigotry comes from ignorance. 

I grew up catholic. Went to catholic school. Church every single Sunday for nearly 2 decades. I'll probably have to spend the next 2 in therapy for what I experienced in that community.  I'm far from ignorant about catholics. Lol.
Catholic priests rape kids and the church protects them. Quit with the holier than thou attitude.
religion: noun     re·​li·​gion | ri-ˈli-jən 

1: a personal set or institutionalized system of attitudes, beliefs, and practices

2a: the service and worship of God or the supernatural
2b: commitment or devotion to religious faith or observance

3: a cause, principle, or system of beliefs held to with ardor and faith

Straight from Merriam Webster. Words have meaning — you don’t get to decide that the literal first definition of a word doesn’t exist so you can push a personal narrative. I bet the movie Dogma pisses you off too, dork.
Then why the issue? I mean they’re not worshipping any other “god” before your own, go be proselytisic like a good Christian.
> How does that violate separation of church and state? Is the state house forcing people to convert, is it subsidizing a church, is it denying funds to other church's? Or are anti-religious bigots just looking to spread their own misery around.

Pot calling the kettle black. Calling anti-religious people bigots but then calling other religions invalid. Also don't think the Satanic Temple is doing your other claimed things. It's not forcing people to convert or subsidize a church or blah blah blah. It's just scaring you. I can hold you if you want?

> Or there's a cross cultural awareness that marriages tend to create more stable environments for raising and rearing children.

Tell me more about how it's only between a man and a woman. And how that's what the government should incentivize. 

> The fact that atheists in the west conflate Christianity with a virtually universally recognized good that is monogamous marriage doesn't exactly dunk on Christians.

Utah has entered the chat.
And who are you to say that satan is evil? Just because your religion says so? Well mine doesn't say that. your beliefs don't run the world dude.
The only one who sends people to eternal torture is your god
Satan was the bringer of light, if you think that’s evil, that’s your problem.
Satan is a religious construct they are using as a tool to point out problems that religion is bringing to our society.  The satanic temple does not engage in acts of violence or oppression, nor do they condone it.  The kkk can say they've rebranded all they want, they are still a racist organization whose sole purpose is to promote white people over all other people to the extreme detriment of those other people.

I think you can tell the difference between a group of people offending you by their choice of mascot versus another group of people engaging in literal oppression of large groups of humans.

Also, the satanic temple is anti religion, not anti christians.  They don't hate you, they don't oppress you, they don't harm you.  I'm sure any member of the organization would gladly wish you well if you ever interacted with them.
There's no hate like Christian love
The issue is that "christian love" is, by definition, hate.  Christianity (as well as all other religions) exists to segregate and separate people into groups and to divide humanity.  Only once religion is dead will the people of the world truly unite.  Once we recognize that we are all one people regardless of skin color, ethnicity, language, disability, etc., we will be in a much better place than when we are divided by religions.
Christianity does a lot to minimize what you guys call "sins". Why stop trespassing when it will be forgiven? Why stop any bad behavior? It's a serious part of the whole catholic pedo issue.

Also, it is evil to use the threat of hell. Hell is by definition the worst punishment possible and the only reason your ancient text has survived. It's absurdly unbelievable but is often accepted as fact by little children. Your god has all the attributes of an abusive partner.
Whatever helps you sleep at night fascist.
.....and you're a supposed Christian?  No wonder everyone's fleeing.
All evidence to the contrary thus far, but alright

this is a fair test that has worked across my time in the restaurant and construction industries. Do you think the the idea/image of Satan will make people want to do something more or less? For example, cannabis is "the devil's lettuce"  and was marketed very heavily as a "deterrent strategy" in propaganda and yet...how is that war on drugs going these days?
Dude I watched that speech all the way here in Montana. Well spoke
Hail Satan!
I admit, that I tried discord  and even have the TST group, but don't care for the app so that one appears to be on me. You are right though, FB buried stories on TST and the labor movement on my timeline real hard this year.
LaVeyan Satanists, i.e The Church of Satan, also do not believe in Satan. Luciferians believe in and worship Satan
wait, the actual Church of Satan pays taxes? wtf for
I, for one, welcome the story of Zombie Jesus
“Not very nice” lol love it and yes
Y'know I thought that's what it was but my phone autocorrected and I just went with it. Thanks I fixed it.
It’s fair play when people called the now-defaced statue in IA “dark” and “ominous” and “evil”, when it was literally candles, flowers, and a tinfoil goat head. 

In comparison, a flogged man pinned against a crucifixion gibbet proudly displayed over an altar where you eat and drink your deity’s flesh and blood isn’t a great look, if we’re talking about “dark displays.”
Mmm-hmm.


>Self-flagellation is the disciplinary and devotional practice of flogging oneself with whips or other instruments that inflict pain. In Christianity, self-flagellation is practiced in the context of the doctrine of the mortification of the flesh and is seen as a spiritual discipline.   

>It is often used as a form of penance and is intended to allow the flagellant to share in the sufferings of Jesus

When people kneel before something and pray to it, seems like it could be an idol.

Mary, the cross, the golden bull, Baal, Zeus.

Why is one of those things not like the others? Because it's your idol?
"It's not idolotry if we do it!"
Rings true for them to, between the British in the past and India now, they have always been treated like shit. Even though their faith is a belief that every religion is correct in its own ways, and that it's every person's responsibility to challenge evil.
I guess I don't know a lot about Sikhs culturally. Orthodox Jews tend to stick together in their own communities. Are Sikhs the same, or do they interact with the other people around them a lot more freely in their communities?
You wouldn't be so worked up if you weren't a Christian my man. Once again, have a happy holiday season!
jesus, dude. why? because they have different beliefs than you and pointed out factual truths about the christian rituals? I hope you're not a christian, your god would be disappointed to see you talking to someone like that.
I may die alone, but probably not sad.  I believe there is eternal life for those who believe in Jesus!  I guess if I were wrong, would just be an eternal void of nothingness.  We shall see I suppose.

thank man! Merry Christmas
>You don't actually know what you're talking about

So why, precisely, did the ST name itself after Satan if NOT to be a direct mockery of Christianity?

Frankly I'd have more respect if it were some Flying Spaghetti Monster / Pastafarian organization, at least then it's not a clear middle finger pointed straight at my religion.
I don't understand people that think they're Catholic, then proceed to ignore the progress the church is making. If there's one person who wouldn't be offended by this, it's the current pope. 

It's typically wack jobs who want to live by zero tenets of actual Catholic faith and feel that somehow rage against gay people or civil rights is their hill to die on. 

Kudos to the ST, they represent more ideals of Christ than do many churches.
>Edit: they are a r/catholicism effort poster so they’re nuts essentially

So you're just going to...be bigoted I guess?
There's never a bad time to remind people that Satan is not an aspirational figure. And any organization that venerates Satan should not be given consideration as good willed or acting in good faith.
>I think it exists more to expose the existing intolerance and hypocrisy of many religious folks

Who? When? And How?

Local Church asks to put up nativity display during Christmas. Muslims don't get pissed about it. Jews don't get pissed about it. But the ST thinks this is a golden opportunity to mock them with a 'counter' display. That is bad faith and it's not worthy of the respect we should afford to actual sincere religious beliefs.

Do I hate atheists? No. 

>The division and anger seem to be from the people taking the bait.

If you crap on the street in front of my house, and I get angry. Who's the jerk here?
Yeah, they sincerely believe that life is worth protecting and that life begins at conception. You can think they're wrong, but they're coming from a place of protecting defenseless people from an unprovoked and violent death.
It's 'could have', never 'could of'.

Rejoice, for you have been blessed by CouldWouldShouldBot!
Hello, it looks like you've made a mistake.

It's supposed to be could've, should've, would've (short for could have, would have, should have), never could of, would of, should of.

Or you misspelled something, I ain't checking everything.

Beep boop - yes, I am a bot, don't botcriminate me.
>TST exists to remind religious wackos that if they want to push their faith into public spaces, then they must be willing to endure other faiths being pushed into their face as well.

Neat, the ST isn't an actual faith. It exists to mock religion. As in a prior example, if someone started a "Jefferson Davis Cult" and work KKK hoods, we'd know they were just racists using religion to put burning crosses on public property. The ST is doing the same thing, using religion to mock Christianity on public property.

I've probably visited more temples to other faiths than you've ever seen. I admire other religions in many ways and enjoy discussing our differences respectfully. The ST is not a faith, and it is not capable of engaging in good faith discussion, it is a mockery and doesn't deserve public recognition or respect.
The government approved them. They're a religion, whether you like it or not.

The fact that you can't get past the symbol is on you.

Do you think that the New Jersey Devils are literal devils?
>Unless when you say "religion" you just mean "Christianity" and by "removed from public spaces" you just mean "not granted exclusive rights to be in public spaces over other religions, violating the establishment clause of the US Constitution."

I'd never begrudge a Hindu, a Muslim, a Jew, or any other real and honest religion a place in the public forum. The ST exists soley to spite the religious, that is why they named it the 'satanic' temple, out of spite. If your purpose is to agitate you are not worthy of respect or consideration.

A Muslim operates from the perspective of willing the good of others, their belief may run counter to mine, but we are coming from the same place in pursuing good. We don't exist merely to spite one another. The ST sets itself up using the namesake of the great evil of my religion, I have no need to entertain them, they do not will my good.
"Please don't enshrine one religion over others with the power of the government."

"White people are better than black people and we'll kill to back that up."

These two things are the same, right?
>These displays are for the sole purpose of pointing out your hypocrisy

What hypocrisy? I have no issue with the sincerely held religious beliefs of others. The ST named itself after Satan to troll, that's it. It doesn't deserve the respect I hold for Muslims, Jews, Hindus, and other religious adherents.
>He espoused a philosophy that was unacceptable to the rulers and the state religion.

Not quite.

>So they did a thing.

Oh, and there's our lack of reading. See, part of the whole injustice about the crucifixion's of Christ was that the Romans actually didn't find that he violated the law and refused to find him guilty of anything. The reason Jesus was crucified was because the Sanhedrin whipped a mob up into a frenzy. The roman leader Pontius Pilate gave the public the option to execute Barabbas or Jesus and the mob decided to allow a convicted murder to go free and make Jesus take his place.

>And you are still okay with government choosing what religions are good to go?

It already does. The government rejects tons of applications for religious exemptions every year. The fact the ST slipped into the official register just means, to me, that the rules need to be tightened up. It's a shame, but that's what happens when bad actors abuse the legal system.
>Maybe Catholics should start showing some tolerance towards others before they start expecting it back.

They do, perhaps try reading the actual catechism of Church beliefs before you start making uninformed assumptions.
I mean, the intent of the ST is to provoke division and anger.

If someone craps on the street in front of my house to piss me off and I get angry, whose the jerk?
>It doesn't exist to incite anger

One wouldn't name a group after Hitler and get surprised when it incites anger in Jews. One wouldn't name a group after Jefferson Davis and get surprised when it incites anger in black people. Why wouldn't a group named after Satan incite anger in Christians?
Because people do bad things. This isn't exactly news to anyone, least of all to myself and fellow Catholics. The fact that people are bigoted likewise isn't a surprise, people will cling to anything to justify their hatreds.
1. The ST is not an institution and does not claim to possess an orthodoxy beyond basic principles. Literally every organization has these.
2. The ST is officially and specifically non-theistic, they do not believe in the supernatural.
3. The ST does not have 'faith' faith would imply belief in something beyond material consideration. If we're going by 'ardor' then literally any advocacy group is considered a religion. Yet we recognize the difference between Habitat for Humanity office and a Shinto Temple. Because we're generally smart enough to recognize the difference between an organization with principles, and an actual religion.

Pfft, people can produce whatever movies they want. That's what entertainment is for. Religion is for sincere exploration of human purpose and the qualities of existence beyond material consideration. The ST is a mockery, that's why it's named so.

Frankly I'd be fine with a Pastafarian display, at least they're somewhat creative and I'm sure there's a few actual firm believers in the Flying Spaghetti Monster. The ST doesn't even have that.
>I mean they’re not worshipping any other “god” before your own, go be proselytisic like a good Christian.

Pfft, imagine me thinking I'm a good Christian. Or that being a Christian exempts me from being annoyed as a citizen that people are using the law to mock and abuse people.

Try having a good faith argument with someone and you'll get respect. Enter the public space specifically to be disrespectful and you'll get no respect, nor would you deserve any.
>Calling anti-religious people bigots but then calling other religions invalid.

Because the ST acknowledges that they're a non-theistic organization. They were organized primarily as a legal group, and when they failed to achieve their goals through court cases they filed themselves as a 'religion' to spoil public spaces.

>It's not forcing people to convert or subsidize a church or blah blah blah.

Dude, you don't even understand where the ST came from.

It was originally a group formed to oppose public funding for religious displays. They WON that case. Great, I'm actually cool with not having public funding going towards religious displays.

But then, many towns started opening up spaces where people could donate or volunteer displays as long as they cleaned it up and it didn't cost the taxpayers anything. This \*should\* be a win win. No public money for religious displays, and communities can voluntarily set up little displays during holidays.

The ST decided that it wasn't enough, and that they'd really prefer if there were no religious displays at all. So they would set up displays of disgusting anti-Christian imagery next to nativity scenes to spoil the public space, and make it so toxic that nobody wanted to be there.

>Tell me more about how it's only between a man and a woman. And how that's what the government should incentivize.

Sure. By all available metrics the single most reliable determinant of success (not in poverty, not engaged in criminality, psychologically fit, and physically healthy) for a person is whether or not their biological parents were married for the duration of their childhood. Divorce, same sex parents, and single parent households all show significant increases in poor outcomes for children. It makes sense that governments (including secular ones) would incentivize that kind of relationship.

>Utah has entered the chat.

As it turns out, polygamist relationships are often highly abusive. Probably why it's banned within virtually all Christianity (not really interested in debating whether Mormons are Christian or not).
Got em
Weird, cause "Let there be light" is kind of one of God's oft quoted lines.
>Christianity does a lot to minimize what you guys call "sins". Why stop trespassing when it will be forgiven? Why stop any bad behavior? It's a serious part of the whole catholic pedo issue.

This is the part where I usually direct people to the Catechism which actually explains all of this, in detail, with citations.

[Catholics are called to respect human life and the dignity of others. They are also allowed to defend their own lives and their own dignity using appropriate measures, up to, and including lethal force.](http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s2c2a5.htm)

Part of being Catholic is realizing that you are made in the image of God, so you should treat yourself well and protect yourself from harm when and where possible. Likewise, you should not do harm onto others when it can be avoided because you are harming a person made in the likeness of God.

> Also, it is evil to use the threat of hell. Hell is by definition the worst punishment possible and the only reason your ancient text has survived. It's absurdly unbelievable but is often accepted as fact by little children. Your god has all the attributes of an abusive partner.

Ugh, sorry but this is like the 9th time I've explained this in the thread. I, nor can any other mortal person, condemn anyone to hell. Hell is the willful separation of oneself from God. Because we have free will we \*choose\* hell for ourselves by either embracing sin or denying God's grace and forgiveness.

Only God knows what's going on in peoples minds/hearts, nobody else has any knowledge of who goes to hell. We know that it's difficult, and that following Christ and his Church makes the path easier, but we don't have a thetan testing device to determine whether you're going to hell or not. It's not how Christianity works.

If you kill someone, that's a sin. If you sincerely repent and seek to attone for that sin, and accept Christ's forgiveness you may get into heaven despite your sins. Likewise, if you murder someone and say "no God, I was in the right to murder that person, they deserved it" then you have separated yourself from God, or even if you repent but you say "yes God, what I did was wrong, but not even you can forgive me for what I've done". That's what hell is, separation from God.

God is our Father and he wants us to come home, but we have to leave all of our petty baggage behind. We're supposed to love and not lust, we're supposed to seek justice and not wrath. And we need to accept that we fall short, seek forgiveness, and accept forgiveness.

It is childish to use hell as an idle threat, it is likewise childish to not understand what hell actually is when you have the resources available to you to learn.
An actual image or a cartoon/ purposefully made to be non offensive version? Both are representative of evil however society has strayed extremely far for traditional beliefs. As for the war on drugs I don’t think, focusing specifically on weed isnt very fair comparison it’s still a sin however personally I prefer people smoke instead of go on opioids it’s not even a for fight.
Thank you!💜
Because it's the right thing to do.
What do you think walked out of that tomb?
Yes the practice that is mainly Catholic in use and is generally discouraged by the church. Very select sects practice it an overwhelming majority of Christian’s don’t.
This is a really bad example. It’s only practiced by fringe sects.
>When people kneel before something and pray to it, ***seems*** like it could be an idol.

And? It's not. You know it's not, I know it's not. Some random person who knows nothing of christianity might think that. Then they can be corrected. And if they aren't or refused to be, who cares?

Someone being wrong doesn't change reality.

>Mary, the cross, the golden bull, Baal, Zeus.

>Why is one of those things not like the others?

None of these things are anything like the other things except in the most bare threads of connections. This is like saying a grain of rice and jupiter are similar because they are both things. 

>Because it's your idol?

The cross is no one's idol. Jesus Christ is the idol, and the cross is a symbol for Jesus Christ.
we aren’t kneeling for the cross, we’re kneeling for jesus

I know what you mean, man! I saw some dude yesterday with a freaking Voldemort shirt on!  Voldemort!  You shouldn't even say the dudes name, and this guy straight up had a shirt on praising him!
Go reread this thread, go reread about the Satanic Temples tenets and stated goals. You either don't understand what you're reading or you're being willfully ignorant because they used the name of the Christian boogeyman.

Satanists don't believe actual Satan exists, folks who do believe there is a real Satan are called Christians.

And as somebody who was raised catholic it makes me wonder how anybody can continue to support that corrupt and evil organization
Is this the snowflake behavior you people like to talk about all the time?
Your religion has given the middle finger to the rest of the world for a thousand years, I think they'll be fine getting one back now and then.
[removed]
The Crusades, Manifest destiny, a long spanning history of persecution against jews... Yeah your religion has definitely never pointed the middle finger towards others religions
>at least then it's not a clear middle finger pointed straight at my religion.

Even if they WERE founded as a religion with the sole purpose of being contrarian to Christianity, that would be irrelevant.  They're still allowed to do so by the Constitution.
[removed]
The Catholic Church is infinitely more evil than the idea of satan. I say this as someone born and raised in the Catholic Church.
Maybe do something about all the fucking pedophiles in your church first, then you can go ahead and bitch that a goat made of sticks hurts your fee-fees.
Wait who's the bigot?? Wake up... You still believe in fairy tales.

Given that, according to the Bible, God has:

* Murdered children.

* Genocided basically the entire world (Noah’s Ark), to include almost all people and animals.

* Released plagues to cause famine, then killed the firstborn of ever family in Egypt.

* Killed a man for not having sex with his sister-in-law and not having more babies.

* Gave authority for a human being (Samson) to mass murder.

* Job.


Notice the trend of God in the Bible? Seems to like killing things, particularly babies and children. It’s almost like you don’t even know your own book you so venerate.

Also please don’t get me started on Catholics in particular. With how that sect of Christianity has a propensity to rape and murder children and somehow have it covered by the church. And you people make excuses for it.
Satan isn't real, and TST is just ensuring that religions are treated equally by the state.
Cringe. Pick up knitting or something
It is bad faith in your opinion.

Their golden opportunity is to once again demonstrate that there should be no place for religious displays on public property.

And you and your ilk take the bait every year, being pissy about a religious display, because it's not a religious display you think should qualify.

Because be tolerant unless it's something you may not agree with, right?
fetus' aren't 'people'
Ok, so you approve of protecting women (defenseless) from a fetus that is killing her body, right?
Your god doesn’t even believe life begins at conception. Maybe you should try reading that book you seem so keen on.
>doesn't deserve

It's always wild when Christians start trying to dictate what other religions do or do not deserve.

I'd love to know who made you the arbiter.
While you can have your own personal beliefs about what a real and honest religion is, the US government can not. And that's exactly what this is about. _You_ don't have to agree with anyone else's religion, and _you_ don't have to practice it, but the government can't tell them not to practice it unless it infringes on someone else's rights.

As soon as the government gets into the business of telling people which religions are real and honest, it opens the door for somebody to say that any religion isn't real and honest and have the government start restricting it. That's exactly what the establishment clause is for. Preventing the government from picking and choosing which religions are valid.

Your personal religious beliefs do not supersede US law, and you really don't want to live in a country where they do.
All your statements show is just how ignorant you are of what the Satanic Temple actually stands for. You're just prejudiced, reactionary, and making yourself look small and prickly. 

For what? Over a symbolic goat? 

Dude. Get real problems, ffs. I'm begging you.
[removed]
Disinterest in semantics doesn't equal lack of reading.

 Unfortunately, years of Catholic and Christian schools left me over-educated in something I really had no interest in other than socio-political aspects.

I think that you fundamentally don't understand that it's not abuse of the legal system for a religion to be recognized, just because you disagree with it.
I’m very informed about the Catholic Church my friend. I was raised in the cult and fully drank the juice for years. 

Some people just actually grow up and realize they’ve been lied to their entire lives.
The intent of ST is not what you say it is, but I’m not going to waste my time trying to explain that to you if you’ve already convinced yourself otherwise
Well the issue is, of the three beings mentioned, Satan, Hitler and Jefferson Davis, only two of the three actually exist(ed.) So you being upset that they're named after Satan (which according to the bible only literally means "adversary" not evil anything) is akin to someone being mad if there was a group named after Voldemort or Nurse Ratched.  

Your inability to separate factual evil from fictional, is worrisome.
It’s not bigotry when you hate an organization for legitimate reasons. 

Catholic priests rape kids, the church protects them, that’s a fact. Anyone who supports an evil organization like that deserves to burn in hell.
The cognitive dissonance is off the charts here 🤣 I never thought I’d hear someone say they give more credence to a fake meme religion built on satire about intelligent design than a federally recognized tax exempt faith branch. I hope for societies sake you never reproduce.

Again, you can add all the qualifiers you want but you don’t get to decide what words mean. By it’s very definition The Satanic Temple is a religion and nothing you can do or say will change that. Go shout at some more clouds, old man.
You’re gonna have to explain how this goat thing or “church” is mocking and abusing people.
> Sure.

More anti-religious bigotry.
Irrelevant.  More than one non-existent being can use the word “light.”
Evil is very much a subjective view, Satan is only painted as evil by the preacher. Satan has never committed rape or genocide in the Bible. Committed treason against God for sure, but God's money collectors are the ones saying it is a bad thing that he did it.
Your speech made it down here to boring Kansas as well
Erm, is your speech available online?

To be fair
Some random person who knows anything about Christianity would know idolizing Jesus is idolatry.
So, it's only an idol if not Jesus?

Or is it okay because you're praying to a symbol that actually means something else to you?

So, kind of like the Satanic Temple. They have a symbol, but it means something different to them.
You’re right, missed that, it’s actually Eostre not Ishtar
I'm homeless and naked right now.
Removed. See rule #4 in the [r/Michigan subreddit rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Michigan/wiki/index#wiki_rules).
>Yeah you people are nuts

So that's a yes on the bigotry then. Neat.
>Their golden opportunity is to once again demonstrate that there should be no place for religious displays on public property.

Why?

If someone donates a display, and donates their own time to set it up, and the community is happy with it. What is it about that scenario that makes a TS member think "I really should go in an spoil this".

>And you and your ilk take the bait every year, being pissy about a religious display, because it's not a religious display you think should qualify.

Because the TS isn't a religion. You'll notice that nobody gives a rip what they do in Hamtramck...other than the TS ironically. I wouldn't go into Dearborn and bug Muslims during their holy periods. People who do are jerks.

>Because be tolerant unless it's something you may not agree with, right?

"I came here to cause trouble and provoke people, and to insult you specifically, I demand your respect."
You're free to believe that, and be wrong about it.

That doesn't change the fact that Christians are acting in good faith by trying to protect those they view as defenseless. The idea that they want to take away rights is somewhat nonsense, you generally don't have the right to murder people. So if you believe the unborn are people, then you don't believe they should be murdered. It's really not that hard to grasp.
>Ok, so you approve of protecting women (defenseless) from a fetus that is killing her body, right?

I mean, if you'd like to read up on the principle of double effect, be my guest. But I don't think you're actually interested in the answer here.
>Your god doesn’t even believe life begins at conception. Maybe you should try reading that book you seem so keen on.

Fertilized egg = New DNA = New Life

God tells us not to murder.

It's not a huge leap to make friend.

Your inability to discern intent is more worrisome. If you name something after something that people hate, you're doing so with the intention of inviting anger.

Hitler and Davis are dead, they can't do anything. So if you named a group after them it would only be to harass people. How can you not understand that?
>Catholic priests rape kids, the church protects them, that’s a fact. Anyone who supports an evil organization like that deserves to burn in hell.

Teachers rape kids, the teachers unions protect them, that's a fact. We don't call schools evil.

Politicians rape people, and their parties protect them, that's a fact. We don't call government evil.

Hollywood stars rape people, and their studios protect them, that's a fact. We don't call movies evil.

Charity employees rape people, and their organizations protect them, that's a fact. We don't call charities evil.

Family members rape people, and other family members protect them, that's a fact. We don't call families evil.

Somehow we recognize when bad people do bad things, it doesn't invalidate the entire organization. Bad priests hurt people, and bad bishops cover for them to avoid the extra hassle. The only thing you can do is report it when it happens and try to put in processes to keep it from happening again.

The Catholic Church has done that. Priests aren't allowed to be alone with unaccompanied minors, priests have separate dressing areas now, a whole lot has changed. But people ignore that because it doesn't fit into their anti-Catholic bias.
I mean, you can say things all day, doesn't make them true.

A tomato is technically a fruit, but if you put it in a fruit salad someone is going to call you a psycho. Likewise, if you put a separation of church and state advocacy organization into the same bracket as an actual religion, you're going to be called a liar.
No also that’s the most Reddit take on faith I’ve ever read. The devil after turning on god now lives to eternity turn people away from him (eve biting the apple) however measuring people on an evil scale depends on people and they are nothing to trust. A thief will think himself nothing like a rapist, a rapeist will think himself better than a murder and a murder will think himself better than a diaper sniper. People arnt to be trusted.

lol you have no idea what the definition of bigotry is.

I hope you deconstruct one day and think about this.
You are clearly the bigoted one, quite sad honestly
so all these cases of women now being charged with murder due to the draconian nature of the laws written are actively trying to murder?  A woman doesn't have a right to defend their own lives when the thing inside them is potentially going to cause their death?  There are multiple headlines every day about some woman in texas or wherever that is being charge with murder cause their fetus was nonviable and was going to literally kill them.

the stat is something like 30% of all pregnancies are non viable.  it's just the nature of the game, but idiot christians don't seem to want to listen to people that actually know what is going on.  They pass legislation that doesn't reflect reality.  So maybe, they should just keep their fucking noses out of people's healthcare.

I'm sure you're willing to defend honor murders cause the people stoning the woman are acting in 'good faith' right?  How about all those people that got beheaded that were infidels?  good faith my ass.

so a dude dressed up as santa that is punishing those on their naughty list is acting in good faith?
>God tells us not to murder.

\*unless he says it's okay

It's not that murder is bad.  It's just bad when it's not directed by god.
Wheat has DNA. Is a farmer committing genocide every time he harvests? If you’re only talking about human life, I assume you find it equally abhorrent that your god murdered all the firstborn of Egypt, or that he murdered every living thing except for one guy and his magical boat of animals.
He's far from a "fake xtian," he's pretty much a bog standard one.

Hitler and Davis = real (so the harms they inflicted on society = real)

Satan and god = imaginary (so the harms they inflicted* on society = imaginary)

Does that clear it up for you? You could name something The Hannibal Lector Institute for Ethical Meat Consumption and it should be no more offensive than The Satanic Temple.

(Ninja edited for clarity.)

Edit: *the harms inflicted in the name of god do have an impact on society but they are not the fault of any "god" they are the fault of the follower.  And before someone says "well what about the things Satanists do?!" The amount of harm done by followers of a god is exponentially greater than harm done by any self-identifying Satanist.
I call any organization that protects pedo’s evil. The difference is, in most cases, they’re isolated incidents and the pedo’s are fired/prosecuted. If they’re not, that organization is evil. 

Unfortunately, we have thousands of years of evidence showing that the Catholic Church not only doesn’t punish pedo’s, they pay their legal fees and find them a new parish where they can continue to rape children. 

Your entire belief system is a lie and your leadership is infiltrated by countless numbers pedophiles. Burn in hell.
“Everyone rapes kids why is the church different” isn’t the flex you think it is. A supposedly moral group should have a higher bar to pass than anyone else you mention.
lol how have I never seen this. Want to argue against it, kinda can’t, that’s ok we have John brown

A person doesn't have the right to murder anyone. It's not a hard idea to wrap your mind around.

Calm down, you'll think better.
>I call any organization that protects pedo’s evil.

No, you don't. Or you wouldn't interact with any organization.

Democrats, Republicans, Teachers, Sport Franchises, Food Companies, all of them have abusers and all of them have covered for them. 

>Unfortunately, we have thousands of years of evidence showing that the Catholic Church not only doesn’t punish pedo’s, they pay their legal fees and find them a new parish where they can continue to rape children.

Only you don't. At best you have 50 years of evidence showing that roughly 2.6% of priests have been accused of sexual abuse. Bad, but considering somewhere between 3-6% of all adult males are sexual abusers it's not far off the average.

That is consistent between studies conducted in the U.S., France, and Ireland. You single out the Catholics because you already dislike them. Like a white supremacist that uses crime statistics to justify their pre-existing bigotry.

>Burn in hell.

Get better.
>“Everyone rapes kids why is the church different” isn’t the flex you think it is. A supposedly moral group should have a higher bar to pass than anyone else you mention.

It's not a flex. Non-Catholics seem to think that Catholics think they're above the same issues that afflict all of society. We're not. Priests are humans, and some of them are bad actors.

The fact you exclusively focus on the bad actors in one organization, that you don't even belong to, isn't evidence that you care about kids. It's evidence that you hate Catholics.
JB was gangster.

Can't be all bad. You're 3 for 3 in my eyes.

i actually don’t wear a cross. i think that the fish symbol you see from time to time fits better to represent jesus. you know, the one you can draw without lifting a pen off the page. i guess really this depends on the person you speak with. i’m sure some do have values similar to the ones you describe, but it’s just not the norm. sure it’s the stereotype, but just not the norm these days.
a person doesn't have a right to defend themselves?
I was raised catholic. I’ve seen plenty of evil within the church to last a lifetime, thank you. Judgement, abuse, and hypocrisy- you surely are in good company! The priests that do not call out said abusers are just as bad if not worse than the rapists. At every echelon of the church, these vermin exist and even the pope is aware of them. Yet they do what they can to obfuscate and move priests to other parishes to hide their transgressions.

The bar should be higher for the church. You providing other examples to the contrary to muddy the waters speaks volumes 👍
Crowd at the Harris/Walz rally at DTW tonight. 
Just got home. One of the
How the heck do you find out about these in advance?
Forgot they were coming.   
I went down there to take my niece out for a birthday dinner. On the way back, I got on I-94 and noticed cop cars at every exit for a few miles before I remembered WTF was going on. LOL
Why were so many people going down during the speeches? Hot? Crowded?
Welp - forgot to finish my main comment before deleting...was going to say it was one of the *loudest* crowds I've ever been in. The energy was off the charts, especially when Whitmer took the stage.
Fuck yeah. You can tell people are tired of all the weird shit by this point.
My family watched the rally and it was actually really uplifting.
Here is a nice video/view from inside the hanger, looks like more people from this angle.  Sorry I am terrible at linking.

So this is why the line for McDonald's was so fucked and I was late coming back from break 😭
Official numbers? Did they announce how many actually showed up?  Looks like a ton!
I'm at the point where I just hope old/seniors don't get elected for president. harris being 59 seems good. not too young not too old so she has experience but still young enough she can be more idealist than pragmatist when needed.
Damn. That’s exciting to see.
Man the copium in the comments thinking this is fake is on overdrive 🤣
I'm so proud of my state.  This is refreshing.
Bros still pumped he forgot to finish his description
Next time rent the little caesars arena...just an idea
Normally I'm not one to attend a political rally. But knowing that if they have a big crowd just eats trump from the inside is enough for me to go.
It's time to make all this right! 

Vote in November, like your freedom depends on it!
Camera views you'll never see for Trump
Nice big crowd. I was across the way at the McNamara long term parking deck trying to point it out to my kids at dusk but wasn’t sure which hangar the rally was in
It’s almost like there might be some excitement for her run for president. He is so screwed
I was in the crowd of 12,000 in Wisconsin today!! The energy is amazing and hopefully creepy Vance didn’t follow her there too
How many?
Someone is mad right now
Michigan is All about this party. It's lifted us above all others and sustained our position in innovation, natural resources and civil rights!
There are Trumpers on Twitter fucking huffing copium calling this rally and the one before all photoshop/AI.

Fucking hilarious.
Kamala busting out 7 rallies in a week....  Trump? 1...   but don't' worry you get to hear him talk to his billionaire buddy Musk.
The Trump bots are so triggered by this lol
I haven't seen this kind of excitement since the Obama era. The positivity is refreshing!
I was there. It was something.
I feel excited again for America.
Did she take any questions
Trump fans seem to be confused about why everyone's calling them weird, but a quick glimpse of these comments makes it *very* obvious.
Now I understand why there were so many damn buses heading towards the airport I was so lost 😂
looking REAL good!..
Amazing!
I was there. It was my first political rally and it was quite amazing!
But some dumbass on Twitter told me all of Kamala’s crowd shots are CGI/AI so unfortunately this can’t be real, sorry guys. I don’t make the rules
People know she has the message and the momentum. Hope beats anger. Vote Blue!!
This reminds me of 2016. I couldn’t believe all the enthusiasm that 45 was generating. Harris even more so
forklift looks like its scanning the rooftops haha
I love how they moved it to an airport hanger because there was too many attendees and they still couldn’t fit everyone inside
I wish I could have went. I’ve never been to a political rally and it seems like it would be a cool event from a historical perspective
That is a huge crowd
I’d show you the numbers from the Trump rally, but he only does one event a week, totally low energy.
It was fun too hot for my taste
The Revolution will be televised!

Harris /Walz !
Why
Meanwhile Trump rallies look like they rounded up a dozen guys who just stole some catalytic converters and paid them to stand around looking confused for an hour
So funny how Kamala was considered a joke for the last 3 1/2 years and now you are all trying to sell her as some great thing!! Hilarious liberals!!
Dumb liberals everywhere!
#fuckwhitmer
Trump mad.
Good lord!! I am so excited by these crowds. Have to say - I agree with Trump on this one thing- crowd size does seem to matter. It's inspiring! Let's go !!!
Donnie’s cooked
People were definitely fired up and excited to be there. That hanger was a heat trap, but it was breezy outside. The only thing that ruined it were the virtue signaling protesters, who care so much about Palestinians their main goal is to make Trump win. She said as much, “If you want Trump to win, just say it. Otherwise, I’m speaking.” She was pissed.
Crush fascism!!
So much bigger than Trump rallies. His are so small it’s wild.
Wow. Cool!
I know a certain crowd obsessed narcissist that isn’t going to like this pic
I love it ! 💙
I just sent $ 2,000.
You know it’s good when the conservatives are saying it’s ai generated. Hey cope harder but I’ve never been more excited for someone to run for president since Obama in 08 (I’m 26 I was 11 in 08)

Does anyone know if there was a maximum capacity? I wanted to go but it was too close to 7 and I assumed it would be completely full and not let anyone else in.
The thing that worries Republicans the most, is that this is Detroit, and the crowd that came out for Harris/Walz is mostly white people.  Which means GOP racial propaganda has totally failed.  Love it.

Nope don't see any.
Is this administration one that backs unions? What's harris / walz stance on this before they were nominated? In canada, typically, our conservatives aren't pro union.. However, with  our current priminister, we need a change. I'm pro union myself
Looks like a Trump rally
lol why
Heard you had to get there before 4pm and people were still waiting for shuttles to their cars around 10pm. Thats a long time to stand
Dems are suddenly really into crowd size=winning now

What’s your guys favorite policy position on her website?
Well, with crowds like this and down in the basement Donald too afraid to leave his home to campaign it's hard to see how Kamala could lose! If trump wins it must be rigged! 

/s... kinda? Because the only way he can win is if we don’t go vote and he has help to steal it. Which we know they are already planning to do
Seems the communist support is growing in this country.
If that was a Trump rally, he would say there were 50,000 people attending.
I will NEVER understand why people attend these types of events. Red or Blue. Just vote .
Looks like a Trump cult rally.
Well shit, guess shit gonna be expensive for a lot longer than I was hoping…gotta start working on plan b

AI
A friend and I tried— lack of volunteers checking passes and identification at the Wayne Community College parking lot left us with a closed gate by the time we finally arrived by shuttle.  So many people 💙 We stood in the hot sun for 31/2 hours waiting to have clearance to get on a shuttle.  Volunteers did their best but we were left terribly disappointed along with about 140 others from that lot.
Just to be in line felt joyous!
For what high gas and high food prices right now this is the administration responsible
💙💙💙💙 hopeful for the first time in a long time !!
Damn that’s a lot of bots
They're improving their AI generated photos by making it all out of focus.
What's REALLY weird is there are no videos ANYWHERE on line from ANYONE attending this event - ALL THEM CELL PHONES - that corroborates what this video issued by the campaign is showing.

There should be hundreds of videoes out there - but there are not.. Did  everyone just not post this "amazing experience" to their social media. Weird.
I wonder how many were paid actors?
Yall that attended this are dumb as hell. She don’t give a damn about you. She’s fake as hell and doesn’t know anything. Her track record shows this alone. Wake up Michiganders, you’re better than this.
Fake
FAKE NEWS 🤣😅🥴
And Harris answered everyone of their questions. Wait too afraid to ask questions because might get some crazy word salad. But really she doesn’t answer questions, just reads a teleprompter
I hate the state I'm from
Did they take out an ad in the local paper for 'actors' like they did in Phoenix?
LOL - Trump fills stadiums...Harris gets a thusaNDMAYBE..,.30 % paid to be theRE, 30 % bused in...she was selected not elected...she will get mauled in november unless they cheat and whitmer, benson and nessel are good at that !
Other than not being trump, what’s the policies? Did she talk about Jamal Trulove at all?
Ai generated haha
They were claiming this was AI?
Weird
Americans are all so incredible delusional….. honestly its a bit sad watching from another country.

First yall got trump.. we all know how that went. Then 4 years of Biden… well the man has gotten to a point that he can barely wipe his own ass… so they throw you… Kamala Harris, a invisible VP with a questionable history (changing standpoints often) and just as incompetent as her predecessors… and A LOT of The Americans act like she is the Savior?!? I just don’t get it… she wil simply just fuck you over just as much as the fucking rest. I just don’t get the hype around her.. its just so weird to see from this perspective of mine…

And no im not a Trump, Biden or Harris fan. The USA is fucked up and its a matter of time before it will collapse under its own huge pile of excrements.

Who cares
Does anyone know where I can find their platform | policy information they are running? Their website doesn't have much.
This is a terrible picture. The crowd looks fake. Zoom in.
How do so many people crowdthink switch up so fast to forget that Kamala Harris was one of the least popular VPs ever who accomplished nothing and was rarely publicly visible to now being 100% on board with her ruling this country? It’s amazing how much brain rot there is these days
Kamala is an awful candidate
Trump 2024 for a better Michigan
So this race as become about who’s crowd is bigger and who’s weirder rather than policy issues like boarder security and the economy… we are so stupid
I. Just. Why does anyone waste their time with these rallies? Same question for Trump rallies. Are you getting paid to be there? It'd have to be a healthy check to get me to go see one of these politicians blow smoke up everyone's ass for however long they last. 

I get why politicians do it, but the people that go??? Legitimate question for anyone that has attended one.
So when Trump comes to MI with a big crowd it is "Trump derangement syndrome" and "idolized a politician". But when it is Kamala it is exciting and a great thing?
End the genocide!
Love seeing all these people show up for her don’t get me wrong. But does having a political rally at the airport seem like the safest option?
is she gonna lose MI after telling protestors to go away because half my social media is muslims bitching about that? note: i am muslim but also a women federal employee who doesn’t have the luxury to vote on one issue the other side would be worse on.
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
Anyone else never used the r/michigan sub previously that are now having it on their feed as “a topic i have shown interest in”? Stop shoving politician love and praise in my face.
but but i thought they all had jobs and couldn’t go to rally’s😂😂

Both candidates, Democrat and Republican, take money from AIPAC.

All you need to know.
Huge huge crowds. The biggest. lol 🍊
This is the \*REAL\* reason for Kamala's "huge" crowd in Wisconsin today.  
  
Just like we all thought: Billboard #1 charting band Bon Iver with Justin Verno is performing at this rally.   
  
It also happens to be the band's hometown.   
  
So, now you know.
Aww that’s cute
U know when I knew khamla had my vote? When I saw the 19 year old former rapper throwing her asshole up and down on stage at her rally. that's what empowered woman do! get over it!
Heard it was a shitshow when it was over.
A sea of delusional people, fitting.
How much were they paying?
Crazy that many people are supporting two socialists. Guess people would rather have the cost of living continue to increase while continuing to send tons of money to Ukraine. Sad future for this country
Where is Cardi B at? Heard there was a free show?
Why is no one concerned with the fact that she has not spoke off script once since her nomination..? Like political bias aside, doesn’t that worry anyone? Not one question, not one statement besides pep rally talk which are all copy paste speeches with very little ad-lib or variation, not one Q&A..

I’d love to vote for her, but I have no idea what her plan is. She speaks like she isn’t the current sitting VP. “On day one I will fix inflation and lower prices” like uhh ma’am.. could you kinda try and do that now? How about a good faith small adjustment to show me that you can do even 1/4 of what you’re saying. You’re not some up and coming candidate with fresh ideas and values, you ARE the vice president of America at the moment.

Idk. I’m worried it’s just more political banter and she just wants to try and get the independent votes. Idk if she’s this new and improved moderate Harris, or still the far left Harris that got ZERO votes in 2020 and didn’t even make it to Iowa.

I did this for about an hour yesterday and it was quite amazing ! 

You use your computer, and it dials for you *and* gives you a script to go off of… It had me calling people who were signed for yesterday‘s event in Detroit.  Very positive conversations with 96% of them.
Sign up for Kamala’s email.
you can sign up on her website to receive updates about campaign events. The rallies aren’t announced that far in advance, so having those updates are really useful since it’s hard to find out about them in time otherwise
Go to their website ( don't have the exact name right now, but will be easy to find). Get on their mailing list, you'll get regular details of all MI meetings/events/opportunities to help right down to your zip code. Both will be returning to MI again, but likely not together. Some national Democratic politicians are already scheduled (e.g. Nancy Pelosi in GR in a few weeks, probably accompanied with some local pols.)
It was announced a week ago over social media and has been in the local news since
Volunteer with the Michigan one campaign
They posted a whole schedule at the beginning of the week…
Right? I donated and didn't get any notification about this event. I get dozens of other emails and txts per day tho ...
The people I know who went were members of their local Dem Clubs/ county delegates for conventions. 

I found my invite in my spam email folder too late. It sounded like fun, but my anxiety couldn’t manage that many people.
Make a 10$ donation.
Sign up for stuff.
The texted me the other day and said she was coming to Detroit
I received a text.
I looked up if she was coming to Michigan on Monday night, saw that she was and signed up.  I told my wife to sign up on Tuesday, and it was fully booked.  We did not end up going unfortunately, but looks like it was standing room only!
It was crazy hot in there and people were standing in that hangar for at least 6 hours before Harris took the stage. Plenty of water and bathrooms but people just didn't want to lose their spot I guess.
People were standing for a long time. Often when you lock your knees standing for a long time, it can mess with your circulation and you can faint. I think that was happening more than heat, it wasn’t *just* heat I’ll bet. But I can’t imagine it felt great in that crowd and likely not much in the way of circulating air.
Hot, people generally do not know how to stand for long times, usually locking their knees for stability which usually leads to the issues. But not a cloud in sight and sun out all day.
The vibes are so different from how things felt a month ago.  People need to keep this energy up to make sure everyone follows through and vote.
She was absolutely gorgeous in that magenta. I love that woman!
My understanding is, it was their biggest rally yet.

Thanks for attending and supporting the campaign..

I wasn't able to attend but I've donated to the campaign twice.

I would've loved to show up myself, but I only just learned about this rally a few minutes ago - surely I'm not the only one? Was this a planned out thing? I've been really hoping to be able to make it out to a Kamala Michigan ralley, but apparently she's come and gone before I even realized she was coming here!
But look at all that empty space up front!

Its really in the persona.  Bernie Sanders is 82 but very sharp minded.   I think he is too old now, because at 86, he should be retired, but if he had gotten elected at 78, I wouldn't have thought he was too old.   

Biden could be very capable of making the right decisions, but he does not have another 4 years of that at the rate he is declining.   he needs to take a long deserved retirement vacation when Kamala beats trump.

I agree Harris' age is fine.  But I even think Pete B. at 42 is fine.   Its the person to me.
If the voters, 30 years and younger show up in big numbers it will change the tide. That group is 65% Democrat. Even 40 and younger is 55% Dem. Do it election over election and we'll see Democrats be able to work together across the entire federal government. And those elected officials will be much younger overall.

Right now the Fox News/CNN/MSNBC viewers are dominant (average age is 65), basically that's the establishment. No wonder they have no problem with politicians in mid-70s and older.
Same it’s beautiful to see
I thought it was more like the old Mad Libs and you fill in your ________
The cars though we have terrible public transportation little down fall but I’m happy so many were able to make it to this location
A lot of it has to do with travel time to their next campaign stop, hence being right where the plane can take back off again with no carpool necessary.
Yes please, with seats. I can't be on my feet for that long unless I'm moving around. I went to a Bernie rally several years ago, and it was murder on my back.

This wasn’t their only rally so they flew out right after.

They were expecting 8,000 people at this event. What you’re looking at is simply the overflow.
As a Kamala phone bank volunteer yesterday, I was told that Biden would’ve garnered about 1,000 people at that same location. 

**Vote Blue-Vote Kamala/Harris !**
They're in this comment section working overtime. I'm thoroughly enjoying every delusional cope paragraph they type.
Just don’t drive through Macomb, feels like every other house has a Trump sign. Explains why I know so many assholes from that area.
GR is not. I live there. It is weird being a non trumper here.

Are you being facetious? I can't tell, but if you aren't, let's not pretend Trump doesn't draw big crowds. People were lined up over a mile when he was here in GR not too long ago.

Honest answer: I’m still on my vacation from work and it’s been a bucket list item to see a speech by a current Pres/VP. Helps that it wasn’t way out of the way for me either in terms of travel.
Some people get excited about basic human rights,  improving the quality of life for ourselves as a nation, and maybe averting the destruction of our species from existential threats like climate change. 

With so much bad news, with a world that often feels out of our control, rallying together in common cause, despite our differences, gives some people hope that even though we may sometimes feel isolated, maybe we’re not alone. And maybe if we work at it, we can help each other.
Thats's your first mistake. You think that after everything that has happened in the last few years that "both sides bad". Its not. One side is objectively worse than the other. Thats why.
Did you see anyone wearing gold diapers outside of their clothing in this photo?
Sorry Trump crowd was tiny in GR.  Also to answer your question... Yes,  Trump is a grifter, sexual predator and convicted felon... but people still show up for him? that is a cult.
That would be to say that Harris and Trump are the same type of person to come out and support, one of whom is an adjudicated rapist, 34 time convicted felon, who was good buddies with a well known pedophile. The support is not the same, and you’re either extremely ignorant or willingly arguing in bad faith to imply that it is.
They ware adult diapers because trump shits his pants.
I hate both sides, but I hate Trump even more and Project 25 is the sole reason I’m voting blue, but this! The mental gymnastics people play to put down the other party for the same thing they’re doing is laughable.

I was there from 2:00 to 8:30. The hangar was like a heat trap, and there were a lot of unfortunate elderly folks who couldn’t handle it. I’m just thankful it was an 80 degree day not a 95 one
I was there, there weren't enough snacks provided. There should have been more food, not just water diabetics needed the calories.  Also, that hangar was boiling hot.
It's like 90 days. In many ways Harris has the luxury of a sprint instead of the year(s)long grievance lawncare fast food tour of TLG. She doesn't have to sustain this. 3 months. One quarter. The high energy is going to get bigger and probably won't even hit it's ultimate peak before the election. I'm optimistic.
No more 2016s!

Go ahead and flip that, historically the economy does better under Dems, once they fix the fuckery the GOP causes. If they come in after one of them, half their term yeah it’s bad, but that’s the result of the previous Republican administration making it so. And for the record, Trump and Vance ARE weird, or do you not see the daily meltdown tweets, or the couch fucker’s idea that childless people should have their votes count less?

Thanks for the link, but the post and I are talking about Michigan.
Wait wait wait.  That's ***just*** 15,000 people?!?  You could have told me 50,000 and my naive ass would have believed you.

This led me to Google "estimated crowd density".

In a crowd where everyone is an arm's length from the people standing next to them, each person occupies 10 square feet of space.  That's 1.11 square yards, or 0.929 square meters.  In a crowd of this density you can fit 5,760 people on a football field (57,600 square feet).

In a denser crowd, each person takes up 4.5 square feet (0.5 sq. yds; 0.418 sq. meters).  That type of crowd crams 12,800 people onto a football field.

The space occupied by this crowd easily looks to exceed 1 football field worth of floor space, with very little in the way of bleacher sections.  It probably is less than 3 football field's worth of area, but it's hard to say.  Some of the crowd is seated, which is going to inherently involve spacing people out to make room for the chairs, while the rest is standing close to shoulder-to-shoulder.  So at the lower density that's 5,760 - 17,280 people (1-3 football fields).  At the higher density, that's 12,800 - 38,400 people.

So, for the crowd to actually be around 15,000 people fits inside the overlap of these two ranges, and therefore: it's actually pretty believable!
It was on the website..

I knew about it but couldn't attend. But I've been supporting the campaign in other ways, like donating, encouraging family members to donate, talking to friends and family about the election, etc.

I heard about it on NPR this morning, Michigan Radio. Could not attend myself though.
Once per thread is enough, thank you
Weird people.
Yeah, a lot of bigoted asshole out here. Saw one guy finally took down the huge banner of Biden getting crapped on by an eagle.
GR proper definitely leans left/democratic. The rest of west MI, not so much.

“Both sides bad” is a tool to encourage people not to vote. It’s propaganda. Sure - there are probably some issues where neither side offers the solution you want, but making both sides equal is just a ploy to make people too apathetic to vote.
I didn't proclaim it to be equal. But, I live here, too. The divide in this country is the fault of both political teams. If you believe otherwise, you're part of the problem, too. 

We need to reach out and listen to one another, and neither political team has any interest in a united populace. I'm sick of listening to the rhetoric from them all.
No fake ear bandages either. Strange, isn't it?
And it’s laughable that you think it’s at all the same thing. Do you see anyone in Kamala’s crowds dressing up as if they’re going to their favorite rock concert or sporting event? Trumps crowds appear cultish, Kamala’s are just normal people.

For me its one of those "Im happy with the Biden admin but am worried about his age" so now youre basically giving me his much younger backup.  So Im excited about a reliable continuation of the administration.  Admitting its had its flaws, but a VAST improvement over the shitbag before and more like the Obama days where they were at least trying to make the govt function (and I was a republican who didnt even vote for him).

What’s changed?

Per the article: “The Detroit rally on Wednesday night drew 15,000 supporters in another crucial swing state, the Harris campaign told reporters. Walz called it “the largest rally of the campaign” so far.”
Oh the link for some reason only says Wisconsin but the article tells the numbers from both Michigan and Wisconsin
I went out to vote for the primary yesterday, and didn't hear a single peep about Harris visiting. Myself and all my friends are all, what I'd call, pretty politically engaged, and nobody knew she was coming. 

I'm with you - I support the campaign to friends and family as much as I can too! But, even considering myself 'above average' in terms of civic engagement, I had absolutely no idea she was visiting.
This is true. I saw her in Houston at the teacher union convention. Lots of security measures, especially due to the assasination attempt.
EGR is consistently blue.

I have a few plugins that help me keep track of the usual folks I interact with in my favorite subs. I'm seeing a lot of fresh names commenting at the bottom outside the usual handful that show up in every political thread. I can't imagine what the mod queue looks like for this one.
Well, of course. That doesn't lessen the amount of support he has, though. If we try to dismiss that and get complacent, we lose.
**‘Unhappy’ Trump Is Freaking Out Over Harris’ Crowd Sizes**

*The former president isn't taking well to the throngs of supporters packing events for his Democratic opponent and her new running mate*

BY RYAN BORT, ASAWIN SUEBSAENG
AUGUST 8, 2024

For years, Donald Trump has been obsessed with the size of campaign-rally crowds, viewing it as a prime indicator of his political dominance. He cared so much about it that he had his own White House shamelessly lie about his inauguration attendance, in order to make him feel better.

Now, in the final three months of an uncomfortably tight presidential contest, Trump is flipping out about crowd sizes — both publicly and behind closed doors — but not, primarily, his own. According to one Republican source who’s spoken to the former president in recent days, Trump is “unhappy with the narrative” forming that Vice President Kamala Harris has been attracting high, enthusiastic attendance at the 2024 rallies she’s held since President Joe Biden dropped out of the race.

In private, Trump has recently taken to griping about the media attention the Harris 2024 (now Harris-Walz 2024) rally sizes have been receiving, and at times insisting a number the Harris campaign has put out must be “fake,” the source and another person familiar with the matter say. Publicly, he’s similarly making his displeasure very clear.

“If Kamala has 1,000 people at a Rally, the Press goes ‘crazy,’ and talks about how ‘big’ it was – And she pays for her ‘Crowd,’” Trump wrote Thursday on Truth Social. “When I have a Rally, and 100,000 people show up, the Fake News doesn’t talk about it, THEY REFUSE TO MENTION CROWD SIZE. The Fake News is the Enemy of the People!”

Later on Thursday, Trump held a press conference from Mar-a-Lago, during which he again ranted about crowd sizes at length. “It’s so dishonest, the press,” he said, visibly frustrated, when asked about crowd sizes. “I have 10 times, 20 times, 30 times the crowd size,” he claimed, adding that “the Republican Party, and me as a candidate, has the enthusiasm.”

Trump later claimed that he may have drawn more supporters on Jan. 6, 2021 than “Martin Luther King when he did his speech.”

The 2024 Harris campaign is only a couple weeks old, but it has already gotten under the Republican presidential nominee’s skin in several key ways. Since Biden bowed out, national and battleground-state polls have tightened, and in some cases show Harris now leading. Trump has also expressed what confidants and aides privately concede to be genuine surprise that the Democratic vice president has managed to raise as much campaign cash as she has, and has grown visibly irritated that the Democrats’ attacks on Trump and J.D. Vance for being “weird” have dominated news cycles lately.

Harris and newly minted running mate Tim Walz packed a Philadelphia basketball arena to the rafters on Tuesday, the first stop on the ticket’s swing-state tour. The Harris campaign was quick to troll Trump over the crowd size, posting side-by-side images of the crowd on Tuesday and Trump’s relatively meager crowd in the same area.

Harris rally vs. Trump rally - Same arena in Philly: pic.twitter.com/YqRiRIPRrW

— Kamala HQ (@KamalaHQ) August 6, 2024

The enthusiasm for Harris and Walz didn’t drop off after their kickoff event, with video showing a massive line of cars waiting to get into their rally in Wisconsin the following day hours in advance. The duo was greeted by another massive crowd in Detroit later on Wednesday.

Trump only has one rally scheduled this week, in Montana on Friday. During a rally at Georgia State University in Atlanta last week, he bashed school administrators for not allowing more people into the venue, claiming that “thousands of people were told no.”

The Trump campaign itself said 600 people — not thousands — were denied entry, according to Reuters, which reported that the crowd was “thinning out noticeably” as Trump spoke.

Nice.
Saugatuck 75 and gorgeous. I can’t wait for her next rally. I’ll drive wherever, in Michigan, to support her. She’ll get a lot of votes from Saugatuck Douglas. We just opened a Democratic club here.
The issue with our election cycle vs the UK or France is that our election days are locked in, while they might have to hold one every X years but the date is up to the current leadership
France is like 2 weeks. Lots of Europeans elections are similar
This is exactly what I've been saying. It really maximizes the energy and excitement before people can get complacent.
100%. The year-long cycles are objectively bad for the mental health of the country. 
I've been thinking the same thing. I can handle this timeline - I can pay attention to what's going on, what's being said, without tuning out every time.
It’s almost like the second best person qualified to be president and campaign for president is the VP. I would find it  would be refreshing to see more presidents continue their duties in lieu of campaigning

The other thing is that we also have primaries too, whereas abroad (at least in the UK), the parties decide who the candidate will be for each district. The US essentially used to do that too, but then the 1968 DNC happened (some primaries were present before that, but the 68 DNC really kicked off primaries to avoid that mess again). 

So outside of a 1st term POTUS, the campaigns will essentially start right after the midterms since it's a year out from the Iowa/NH/South Carolina primaries and caucuses. IIRC, the day Trump was inaugurated in 2017, he also filed the paperwork for his re-election in 2020 so he could collect campaign contributions. 

We could have laws that state you can't file campaign paperwork until 6 months before the general election, but the people in power will never change that (plus smaller/3rd party candidates will also push back as they usually need more time to build up name recognition), or 2 months before the first primary.
So they can cheat

You're allowed to be more than one ethnicity, hombre 👍 hell, every white American I know claims they're Irish, German, Dutch, and French Canadian somehow.

Oh and i do mean ethnicity. Race is an artificial term that has its roots in slavery and dominance over peoples.
Well, several hundred years of one thing (with a few exceptions, but lately, shitty reality) will lead to wanting a change, right? And I see you completely ignored the other characteristics I listed. There’s nothing racist about voting for a fresh perspective that I believe will govern in my and my family’s interest, enjoying the fact that she is not an old white man is window dressing. I’m pointing out WHY people like her. That is a factor. And she is black. She is also Indian. Her father is black, her mother is Indian. I didn’t hear any of you calling Obama “white” when his mother was.

Colon cancer in nearly all my siblings. In our 30s. 

First of all, this is gonna be heavy. 

My siblings and I are all in our 30s, born in the mid 80s to early 90s in Midland and mid-Michigan. There are four of us. The youngest was diagnosed with Stage 3 colon cancer in February. Doctors said we all need to get screened, but there isn’t a genetic component that explains the youngest’s cancer. It’s more likely environmental. 

I went in and had two polyps removed and biopsied. One was precancerous. 

My oldest brother went in and had a polyp removed. Also precancerous. 

The last sibling hasn’t gotten screened yet. 

This isn’t normal. 

I’m looking for others in their 30s, born or raised in Midland who have been diagnosed with cancer. There’s gotta be something more going on…

Edit: We’ve done genetic testing. There is no Lynch Syndrome or other genetic markers that indicate he would get this. The best we got is a mutation for breast cancer. 
Here is a map I made with colon cancer in those under 50. You are in a hot spot. [https://statecancerprofiles.cancer.gov/map/map.withimage.php?26&county&009&020&00&0&01&0&1&5&0#results](https://statecancerprofiles.cancer.gov/map/map.withimage.php?26&county&009&020&00&0&01&0&1&5&0#results) 


-I changed “cancer cluster” to “hot spot” because folks are focusing on specific definitions and not the fact that there are simply more cases of certain cancers in the tri-city region than other counties. There is a long history in this region. I’m not sure why there is debate unless you live there and this is too spicy to consider.
Born and raised in midland, just turned 40. Half the kids from my kindergarten class are dead from different kinds of cancer. I've always thought it had a connection to where we grew up. I haven't been to a doctor in years because I have no insurance but honestly I'm too scared to because I'm afraid it'll be the same for me sooner or later. Best of luck to you and your family.
My wife(46) was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer last June, we live in Muskegon. At the time she was very gym fit and healthy diet, always trying to get more fiber in me. It came hard and fast, it's Hell. Sorry to you and anyone that has to go through it or watch someone fight this fight.

To everyone reading this GET A COLONOSCOPY, you may think a colonoscopy sucks, but it doesn't compare to the fight you will face if you are diagnosed with colon cancer.

Warning, this next part may be hard to read for some people. 

>!Colon cancer is fast and brutal, you won't want eat because then you have to use the bathroom and having a bowel movement hurts so bad sometimes that you will literally scream through it. You will have diarrhea 10-20 times a day, every day. Sex is gone because you hurt in all of the areas that sex happens to take place. Lack of eating makes you tired and frail, you can no longer work or do anything fun that requires energy. Chemotherapy and other treatments including drugs all have very serious side effects that are terrible. This is only some of the worst parts. Please please please push your doctor to order you a colonoscopy as soon as possible, you DO NOT want to die slowly from colo-rectal disease. I have tears streaming down my face whilst typing this, this disease is so ugly and horrible and wouldn't wish it on anyone. Hold your loved ones close and don't forget to love yourself.!<

Definitely on the rise in younger people, not just a Midland thing. But also probably not a bad idea to look around as you're doing, in case of other families like yours.
Dow Chemical is what’s going on.
Colon cancer is the fastest growing type of cancer among young people. Doctors haven’t figured out exactly why, but most believe it’s tied to what we eat, like heavily processed foods, lower intake of fiber from fruits and vegetables, and the overall obesity rates rising.



“The National Cancer Institute says early-onset colorectal cancer is now the No. 1 cause of cancer death in people 20 to 49 years old. It gets worse. Studies show that cancer that develops in younger people tends to be more aggressive.”
Everyone only really talks about flint water, but there are areas, particularly in the region you are talking about with worse water.
My mom died 10 years ago due to digestive cancer. Started in her esophagus and 4 months later was everywhere and she was gone. She was only 43. I got some genetic testing done and found out I carry the Colo rectal cancer gene so I'm getting pre cautionary colonoscopies every 3 years. I'm 33 and the medical advice is to start 10 years before your closest relative with the disease died. My aunt also has the gene and is in remission from breast cancer. Sister in law died from breast cancer shortly after my mother passed. And my dear sweet mother in law had stomach cancer and lost half her stomach to it. My aunt who was born here but moved to Georgia in her early 20s seems to be the only healthy member of my moms side of the family.
Husband was diagnosed stage four last year. Doesn’t smoke, eat meat, or drink, and is fit. Every doctor told us most of the new cases they see are under 45. Scary.
Stage 3b Colon CA just before turning 35 here, but mine is genetic w Lynch syndrome. I'm metro Detroit
My wife is an MD and she says colon cancer is a serious issue now with younger people.  The medical community is pushing to have screen start at 40 now, ideally 30, but insurance companies dictate medical procedures. Not many folks want to drop a few grand on a preventative procedure. 

It certainly could be something in your area but it’s also a trend in all young people.  

I’m GenX.  I had four friends with Stage 4 before they were 45 years old.   I started screening at 40 years old due to family history.  I go every three years.
I don’t think you’re crazy. You could definitely be on to something! So long story short my two siblings and I all have a similar situation going on (not cancer and we were born around the same time) where we all have similar problems with our brains and bodies, and we grew up next to the Saginaw river, eating fish out of it on the regular. We have 5 other siblings from our father having 3 baby mommas, and they’re not presenting any of our symptoms. It’s not on our moms side of the family either since our cousins are fine but they don’t eat fish.
I worked at the hospital in Midland about 25 years ago. Several times, I was told that Midland was in the top 3 cities for cancer rates in the USA. The other two cities were former Union Carbide locations, now owned by Dow. While Dow had a "Safety First" program in place, Dow demonstrably doesn't care about people.
Read "The Poisoning of Michigan" it may explain some of the reasons for your illness.

Midland MI had Midland Chemical Company, the company polluted most of MI in the 1960s and 1970s. The contamination killed farm animals, caused deformities, and diseases. 

I lived in Brooklyn MI until 1968, when my family moved to MN. I read that book years later after my sister died from cancer. 

It will open your eyes to so many wrongs in MI.
When you vote.... Remember there are some people who want to get rid of the EPA...
Wishing you luck.  I lived on E Eleven Mile in St Clair Shores for a few years, half the street was dropping dead of stomach cancer.  The area was an EPA superfund cite for PFAS/PCBs.  There is no government attention paid to the actual sicknesses so we are on our own.
Midland screams Dow - and exposure to its chemicals.
Precancerous polyps are not cancer. I’m glad you got checked out before they had the chance to turn into cancer. Colon cancer is on the rise in younger generations. Because what we eat is shit 
I had it about 15 years ago at age 33. Stage 2.  Not super close to Midland. Luckily caught it in time.  Doctors had no idea why I got it so early. My best educated guess is having a horrible diet growing up.
You’re in midland. That place has the highest cancer rates in the country. Thanks to DOW.
Not from Midland, but Rockford, an area know  for ground water contamination by Wolverine World Wide, mostly PFAS caused by the chemicals used.

Diagnosed stage 4 colon cancer at 37.
I'm 45, had a colectomy to remove stage 3 cancer last year. I grew up in midland and gladwin counties. Now I have enlarged lymphnodes being looked at with a petscan that look like a possible recurrence. Also no genetic findings. Fuck Dow
I knew someone from Midland who got multiple myeloma in their 20s. Per Mayo Clinic, most people are diagnosed in their late 60s.
My grandfather retired from The Dow Chemical Company as a Journeyman Boilermaker. The man fought cancer like hell the rest of his life since the day he retired. He beat Colon, Prostate, and Lung Cancer twice. Also had gamma knife radiation done at midland hospital for a spot on his brain. I was young at the time so didn’t ask many questions, as I’ve gotten older I’ve asked my father how and why do you think gramps had so many issues. Only thing he says is Dow.. and the Chemicals they had him use on a daily basis, they knew and didn’t care….
Watch the documentary dark waters.  Dow, 3m, Dupont gave millions cancer and still do all over the world with forever chemicals.  I firmly believe these companies should be responsible for the majority of our ridiculous heath care costs, much of it is from cancer.  I'm sorry about your situation and I was strongly against buying a home in Midland because of this and chose Au Gres instead.   

  
They polluted the earth forever as those chemicals are now found in every living organism on the planet.
Completely agree, that is not normal, but should point out that having precancerous polyps is not the same thing as a cancer diagnosis.
From northern illinois, grew up in south rockford, diagnosed with late stage 3 upper rectal cancer shortly after my 29th birthday in 2022, I have been trying to get my younger brother to go get checked as the treatment was nothing short of a living hell. 

Continue to push your sibling to get checked, you don't want to fight the actual cancer when you can just get a checkup and catch it early.

I had blood in my stool for years and was ignored by my primary for years as symptoms got progressively worse, once I started getting abdominal cramps I got a 2nd opinion and was sent for a painless colonoscopy which lasted all of 4 minutes before they found the 9cm mass.

My friends, if you have blood in your stool that is not bright red, talk to your doctor, if they won't refer you to a gastro, get a new doctor.

Signed 31(M) stage 3 rectal cancer survivor.
Just want to remind everyone to vote in November.

There is 1 Party that believes it is important to protect our environment.  That the EPA, CDC, USDA, etc, should not be eliminated.  That companies should be monitored and be fined (not high enough) for violations and require to clean up contaminated waste.  And may be some executives go to jail.  That food and water safety is important!


That Companies can’t be trusted to monitor themselves.

And then there are Republicans.
Jesus man. Yeah America is a corporate profit center that also houses people on the side. I’d guarantee it’s dioxin runoff from Dow.
I was diagnosed at 34 (stage 3C rectal cancer), and both sisters had adeno-polyps found (I told them to get scoped immediately after I was diagnosed). They did genetic testing on me and didn't find anything. It is important to note that we don't have a full understanding of why rates of CRC are rising in younger folks. There is likely no one single cause (it's amazing how many people want a simple one-note answer to this). It is likely due to a confluence of factors. It is also likely that we don't have a full genetic map understood for the disease (that's why patients are offered an experimental genetic panel, there are tons of genes that we looknfor, but we don't have evidence to form a causative link). It could very well be the case that you fo have a genetic link that we haven't been able to identify.
American chems. Remember to vote for trump if you want more of this
Oof so sorry to hear this. Yet another reason why we should never put our trust in these giant corporations. They literally dgaf about us except when they need our money. Have you thought about reaching out to your local representatives to see if they know anything about this situation? I bet if this has affected you there are more families going through this same kind of unfathomable situation. Sending all the healing vibes and fuck them energy through the universe I can your way.
Sadly Dow water may be involved. I’m not far from you in country measure but my brother had a gf many moons ago from Midland. Their subdivision was contaminated and they could not use their water for drinking or cooking due to Dow.
Well Midland. That’s your problem right there. But don’t go around broadcasting it. Nothing bad happens in Sparkle City. So says the corporate overlords.
Mid 40’s Detroit area. Had issues in 30’s, they thought I was celiac, found polyps guessing around 32. They always tell me they’ve never seen it that young. Get colonoscopy every 2-3 years now. 1 of 3 bros in same boat. I’m just thankful I caught it early enough and can keep an eye on it. 

Think they just this year moved recommending colonoscopies from 50 to 40.
My husband is from Midland and he was screened last year.   3 polyps and one was pre cancerous.  He has to go back in 2 years.   Thank you for sharing what is happening to you.
Check the stats for colon cancer in Marquette County up north. This is real.
Contact a local injury attorney that gets involved in mass torts. They’ll tell you if they are developing a case and even if nothing is being done right now, you can sign a “free” retainer, so when/if this goes down, you are already represented and you can continue to focus on your health.

I hope everyone here is voting for the party that cares about cleaning up the environment more than the other.
Do you live close to the Dow plants?

The executives all belong in prison or worse but unfortunately that’s unlikely to happen
Everyone, if you have a family member that had colon cancer, call your doctor Today. You will need to be screened before you're 45. You are genetically more likely to get it too.
My family lived in midland for 22 years, my dad got pancreatic cancer in his 60s and passed from it. Good luck with treatment, it's a cute small town, but too bad it's cancer-ville.
/u/chipGC, please go to your state represenative for this census block. They can push for the Michigan Public Health department to do a formal study and statistical analysis for abnormal cancer levels, which could be very helpful if you want to take action. Also your story would resound well with your state representative.
Isn’t there a high amount of PFOS up there? I’m in Oakland County and I recently read the most disturbing article on PFOS/PFAS.

It’s almost like there’s a company that makes deadly chemicals in Midland. Nah, couldn’t be…
Mid fourties, male, recently has cancer diagnosis. Born in Ludington but lived in Midland from age 5 to 18.
I'm probably another data point for you.
It’s definitely dow chemical. My mother passed from cancer and worked for them in Ludington for 25 years. The area of the town the plant is in has an elevated level of people affected by cancer.
I have lived in Lake Jackson Texas, where DOW has large facilities. For years we were the only city to have our own MD Cancer Center Clinic. We are only 48 miles from the huge MD Anderson campus.
In early 1980/81 DOW mislabeled PBB as a nutrient feed and it was fed to a bunch of cows. They ran out of colored ink and the chemical worker couldn’t read, something like that. Many people were exposed. They eventually discovered the mistake and had to kill the cows.  I remember the debate about building the containment pit and it having to be clay lined etc. I was in high school and remember being glad I hadn’t been drinking much mild at the time. It was said that it was also passed to babies through mothers milk and was fat soluble.
I was born in Bay City, just like my brother. Our mom and her siblings were born and raised in Saginaw and Bay City. My dad's siblings were raised in Kawkawlin.

On my dad's side, we're coming from a line of strokes and dementia. On my mom's side, there has been my grandma's breast cancer x2, my mom's liver/pancreatic cancer, my my aunt's bone cancer, my next aunt's breast cancer, stroke, and diverticulitis, my next aunt's colon cancer and skin cancer, and my uncle's skin cancer.

I'm in my 40s and had a hysterectomy this year for abnormal polyps.

Whatever is in the Saginaw Bay watershed, it isn't healthy.
I know one gal who passed not that long ago in her mid 30s due to C. I believe most of her aunts have passed due to C too. I know people used to call it C City, so.damn.sad. All of my Aunts & Uncles have passed from C that grew up there (all drank & smoked and got it late in life). I’m so sorry that you have to deal w/this
I'm not entirely sure how it works in Michigan (I did my public health graduate education in Iowa so only know about the process there) but reach out to your local and the state health departments. They have epidemiologists who can evaluate whether or not there is a real cancer cluster and will do an investigation into it.
I grew up off on lake St. Clair.  The majority of my friends mothers and my own, died of breast cancer.  A friend has had a theory that the contaminated lake had something to do with it.
I did not grow up in Midland but I did grow up in the Kalamazoo/Battle Creek area and born in early 90s. I noticed I was losing weight pretty rapidly (40-50lbs in about 5 months). I went to my primary care doc and he ordered some tests. They found out I was bleeding somewhere internally so they ordered a colonoscopy. Both doctors I went to (gastroenterologist & colorectal surgeon) said "you're too young for a colonoscopy" until they looked at my chart. The colonoscopy resulted in them finding 2 polyps that were .5 cm each. Luckily they were not precancerous but now I have to have a colonoscopy every 5 years to be safe because non-cancerous polyps have the potential to become malignant after 10-15 years. I also developed an anal fistula and had a Fistulotomy to repair it (I don't wish this on my worst enemy). I have an appointment with a colorectal surgeon next month to make sure the fistula hasn't re-occurred because I started having the same symptoms of the last one.

They never did find out the cause of my rapid weight loss but i'm attributing it to my old drinking habits. I stopped drinking heavily (7-10 drinks/day) and now only drink on occasion. My weight is now normal and I am no longer rapidly losing weight. Colonoscopies aren't a great experience (except the fun drugs they give you) but worth it in the long run. I said all of that just to say this: when in doubt, get checked out.
Well damn I was born and raised in midland and has a massive polyp removed last year. Thankfully not cancerous but no one else in my family has had issues. I didn’t realize we were in a cancer cluster.
[https://www.michigan.gov/mdhhs/safety-injury-prev/environmental-health/topics/dehbio/pbbs/history](https://www.michigan.gov/mdhhs/safety-injury-prev/environmental-health/topics/dehbio/pbbs/history)

I wonder if it has anything to do with Michigan accidentally being feed flame retardant for two years through dairy and meat.   Everyone should be getting check out more in Michigan because of this man made disaster.
I've got older family in Midland, bladder and lung cancer years ago without the typical risk factors. They won't leave the area, thankfully their kids all did. 

The white lake area is also bad.
I went to high school in midland 2010-2014…this has me worried :(
FIL worked for DOW for 30 years, died of Penile cancer after he retired.
Im glad you say this, and thoughts/prayers for all, its not just midland….I am 37, but was diagnosed with bladder cancer at 33. Doctor told me I had to smoke, NOPE. Exercise, healthy not over weight, etc… he told me “your a victim of the cancer corridor”….. between midland to flint/detroit even, people between 20’s/30’s are getting cancer at a extreme rate, I was told…. Also know male 40 with breast cancer, male 35 bone/liver/brain cancer, all same area….All the ages that grew up after the industry and manufacturing, boomed in our areas…. And we are now suffering from our parents, trying to raise us on “good manufacturing jobs”… not realizing the pollution and air born, toxins, PFAS in all the well water, rivers, streams, etc everywhere….. and we just have to sit here and get diagnosed….
I was having a bunch of symptoms and got a colonoscopy at the end of July. I just turned 35. No cancer or polyps or anything thank god. If you are reading this and are nervous about the procedure, don’t be. The prep is super simple, literally Gatorade and Miralax. The procedure is nothing. Go to sleep and wake up. I did it self pay and it was 1000 dollars, absolutely worth the peace of mind.
Please see a genetic counselor that specializes in cancer if you have not yet!
First off, really sorry to hear about your families bad news.    

Unfortunately, this isn’t just local to you.    Cancer epidemiologists describe early onset colon cancer as a “field effect” exposure of some contaminant that got into the food supply or environment starting in the (approximately) 1970s.    

Left sided colon cancer used to be super rare (right sided was more common).    Now left sided colon and rectal cancer rates are increasing 
massively in younger generations.   


This is the reason why colonoscopy age range has dropped from getting your first at 50 to now 45.   I wouldn’t be surprised if they drop it further in the coming years.  

Here’s an article from UC Davis that provides a good overview: https://health.ucdavis.edu/blog/cultivating-health/colon-cancer-is-on-the-rise-in-younger-adults-what-you-should-look-for/2023/03#:~:text=Before%20that%2C%20it%20was%20recommended,early%20signs%20of%20colon%20cancer.
Cancer surgeon here, but not your physician. If I saw a patient who reported multiple family members with colon cancer under the age of 50, I’d be extremely concerned for a genetic mutation with predisposition for cancer. Specifically, Lynch syndrome/HNPCC. I’d advise that patient to contact a genetic counselor and undergo genetic testing. I know you mentioned that screening was done, but what was the screening? I’d confirm they check specifically for Lynch/HNPCC and other familial polyposis syndromes? Any patient under 50 with colon cancer should be able to have genetic screening performed and covered by insurance. There are several genetic panels available and costs have come down to make screening more affordable if insurance denies coverage.
Holland/Allegan area - had a very large precancerous polyp removed at the age of 28.
I am from bay city 36 male. Recently went to the doctor for blood in stool. Had a colonoscopy done and they found a polyp that came back cancerous. Ended up needing a small section of my lower colon removed. Had that done at the my Michigan hospital in midland two months ago. Males on both sides of my family have had polyps removed before but not until after 50. The genetic testing came back negative for me.
Hey OP. My mom got diagnosed with colorectal cancer at 50 and lived in Midland the last 20 years. Her father and great grandparents had it as well and she also tested negative for genetic markers. I'm 24. Feel free to message me.
It's definitely because of DOW. I've done A LOT of work in the I-Park and it is straight up nasty in there. All the deer look half dead and I always left with a headache.
I’m sorry you are going through this. I have Lyncb and was thinking maybe that was it until I saw that you had ruled it out. I hope the cause can be found, and that your youngest sibling gets screened. If it’s at all helpful I had my first polyps removed at 34 and have not had any since. I am now 48. Endoscopy and colonoscopy every 2 yrs.
I  Worked for Dow Chemical nearly 30 years. When I first hired in the old timers used to talk about rainbow Creek. It was a ditch that ran through the plant and into the Tittabawasse  river. The way it got its name was because everybody dumped their pollution/hydrocarbons into the ditch. Which ran into the river. There was also rumors that when they bought the old Surath scrapyard that there was underground storage for hazardous chemicals there.
Dow chemical would be my guess
Friend, I am 29 M from Michigan in 2023 was diagnosed with Stage 2 colon cancer and had a 5.7 cm tumor removed, I never post on Reddit but thought to share that info to you. The cause of the cancer is still unknown. (Edited) Mother was born and raised in Midland.
Why do you think Dow owns all that land that sits vacant… if it ever changed hands the land would get tested.

All the money they put into the community is buying goodwill they will need in the future
A lot of my partners family suffers from colon cancer

Lot of ex dow employees 

Dow is poisoning a lot of michigan
The drinking water in Midland (city water) is piped in from way up north and is not contaminated. Midland actually had an over supply in fresh water (due to Dow scaling down operations) and there was a plan to supply Flint. Flint decided tapping in to that was too expensive so used their river and the rest is history.
And it’s almost all happening in MAGA country too.  They will defend the right  of DOW chemical to pollute the water and air because hey, jobs…
We're literally being poisoned by capitalists and they don't fear a God damn thing from justice. 

There is no justice. Almost half the states in the US have declared the freshwater fish unsafe to eat because of the lakes rivers and streams being so badly polluted. You can best bet that that pollution has a link to our cancer rates. All of the agrochemicals used on our food are part of that problem and they're directly poisoning us in our food as well as in our environment. 

The fact that none of these capitalists who are destroying our planet and literally poisoning and murdering us fear justice is a big problem. 

Bring back the f****** guillotines. Bring back accountability.
Did you eat a lot of processed meat or red dye?  Pre cancerous polyps are not bad if they are removed. It’s good you got the scan done
Familial adenomatous polyposis is the diagnosis till proven otherwise. See your doctor. Bring it up. Push the issue. Get the genetic test.
Colon cancer is increasingly common I currently have two cousins fighting it and have lost a friend to it as well. If you think you may be in a cancer cluster, I would urge you to report it to your local health department. The state does monitor such things.
Sitting at the oncologist right now after a colonoscopy. 
I’m so sorry this is happening to you and your family. Hoping it was caught early enough for all of you and treatment goes well for your sibling!

I’d still highly recommend genetic screening. I’m not familiar with all of them but there are a few hereditary cancer genes, like Lynch, Turcot, or Gardner syndromes, MUYTH polyposis, FAP, etc.

If it’s a known syndrome, there are other areas that will need screening/monitoring too and knowing where to start helps. But there seems to be more cases happening where the gene mutation didn’t come from a parent (~30%?) and I’m sure it’ll only become more common with environmental factors.

The gene for Attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis runs in my family (attenuated is not as severe and issues start later) and I’ve needed to have regular colonoscopies and EGDs since my early 20s. Multiple polyps (adenomas) removed every time. My cousin just died of colon cancer in his 40s due to ignoring it. 

I’d highly recommend the Rogel Center at UofM Hospital, their GI team is amazing and incredibly knowledgeable. They’ve held family day events and it’s scary how young this is happening all over the state/country. While you look for answers, sometimes it helps to know you’re not alone and have support.
I have in-laws in Virginia with familial colon cancer that's been passed and expressed in pretty much every generation.

Sister-in-law (developed colon cancer, died), her ex-husband (developed colon cancer, underwent Whipple procedure, still alive in his late 60s), their son (colon cancer in his 30s, also underwent Whipple procedure, alive), daughter with husband (colorectal cancer, died in her early 30s), granddaughter (precancerous polyps in her early teens, had small intestine removed age 13). Probably genetic and not environmental as most of the family moved down to Florida where they developed their cancers. Cancer sucks. 

FWIW, OP, you could look up [Superfund sites](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/search-superfund-sites-where-you-live) to see if there may be a correlation with the areas of Michigan your siblings lived.
Dow chemical, Nestle, Berlin/Farro, GM
My family lost a 29 year old to colon cancer from the Thumb. He had a great future ahead of him. We lived between higher incident county s. We had a lot of illegal dumping of chemicals.
Born 81, live in Oakland County.

I had some abdominal discomfort, so I was referred to a urologist who had me do a colonoscopy. 

His comment was that they are seeing so many more cases of colon cancer in people these days that they basically do them as a default now.

I never bothered to fact-check him on it, but that's what I was told.
Dow Chemical shareholders thank your family for their sacrifice.
My cousin was diagnosed with colon cancer last month. He's 32. I don't understand. His surgery to remove the tumor is Friday. 

Best of luck to you and your family.

Edit: he's not from Michigan. I commented before I finished reading your post.
I lived in Midland for two years. Loved the town, but I think I was just blinded by how nice they kept many areas and the parks. 
I’m kind of crunchy and always thought to myself how it couldn’t be healthy to live near that factory. Brushed it off though. 

I’m so sorry you’re dealing with this.
Well now I’m terrified. I also grew up in midland and am turning 35.
You’re drinking dioxins

Literally sitting in a doctors office right now in Bay City waiting to get blood work done & getting sent home with a shit kit to see if i need a colonoscopy.
So... being that age group from Midland should I be mentioning this to my doctor? 🤔
I grew up on a river connected to the Grand River, downstream from GRF airport. Everyone in the neighborhood had well water. I stopped drinking the water when I was 19, I didn’t feel right drinking it for reasons I couldn’t explain, it physically felt bad. Some years after I moved out they deemed the water unsafe and moved everyone to city water. I drank that water for two decades, I bathed in it, brushed my teeth with it, swam in it and accidentally swallowed who knows how much water while in it. I’m so scared.
Grew up by the Ford plant at 18/Van Dyke. Our boat was always covered in greasey grime from 1968 to about 1985. 

I had a ton of precancerous polyps removed at age 39. My family all drops dead from cardiac issues. Nobody gets cancer. 

I’m sure living close by a plant that spewed crap into the air helped speed that long.
My grandpa was some kind of engineer for DOW way back in the 40s/50s/60s cancer got him in his early 60s, wasnt colon but lymph node, I believe.  Aunt died of colon cancer in her 50s they lived in Midland for many years before moving to Cleveland in the early 70s.  Still have a bunch of family up there on my dads side as far as i know.
Man this just stresses me out I’m really sorry your family is going thru this.  Good luck
I'm 49 now, but when I was about 30, I had to have a colonoscopy for something unrelated. 

They removed NINE polyps!  They would have killed me before I was 40.

Since then I've had multiple colonoscopys, and many polyps removed. Including one that grew into my appendix, so I had to have my appendix and part of my large intestine removed last year. 

It's nutty, but each and every one they removed were a type that would be cancer in 5-10 years. 

I feel lucky as hell to be alive!

I have a lot of family in Kentucky where my mom's parents are from, that have have had colon cancer. Many died, some survived it. So I've always chalked it up to that being just my family. But it could be environmental, except nobody in Michigan has had it that I know of. 

I've lived in SE Michigan my entire life. 

I've been told to limit red meat and eliminate bacon from my diet, among other things. Not sure if that will really help. And now I have to have a colonoscopy every 3 years for the rest of my life. Which is fine, I don't want cancer, it sounds like an awful way to go. 

I wish you and your family the best, OP!
Grew up in Midland

I was told if I lived there before 1988 that I have 3x national average risk of breast cancer and that it’s a “cluster”

Mom still lives in Midland

She smoked 3 packs of cigarettes x 45 years and contracted lung cancer

Pardee Foundation paid for all her chemo & radiation

Seems to me there’s a judgment against Dow & cancer clusters based on Pardee Foundation
Sorry to hear, both my parents had colon cancer.

Get ready to know your gastro-ent guy on a first name basis.  Also, ask a lot of questions so you're involved, it helps.

Good luck.
So sorry to hear that. 💜

That's where my Grandma lived, and she had colon cancer. Her sister also had cancer, but I don't remember which kind. Their mom outlived both of them. =( 

Makes me wonder if it's environmental or genetic in their case, because I wasn't going to be very surprised if I ended up having cancer, too, eventually. 

I'm also paranoid about getting Alzheimer's, like my Grandpa, so I am big about taking lots of photos of my memories.
It has to do with Dow chemical dumping dioxin in the midland river system. Dioxin is an ingredient in Agent Orange. Both my mom and I have GI issues due to it.
if you consume meat and dairy in MI, this should be required viewing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9GTa3a-tFo
(it's a vice doc on PFAS integration into the water and food supply on MI farms)
I grew up in Bay County in the 70s/80s/90s. I remember hearing that Dow had airborne chemical releases…but don’t worry, they contained them. With their giant dome??
I have a friend from outside Detroit whose parents both died from colon cancer in their early 50’s.
My dear friend passed away from colon cancer at 27 years old, and his mom and dad passed away from cancer around the same time as him. There definitely is something going on in this area and it is crazy how it just keeps happening.
Lynch Syndrome. Need to look into that. I have it, got it from my Mom. We both have tons of colon cancer.
I was diagnosed with stage 1 at 24, 2007. I’m born and raised in the Yoop.
I've been trying to get my younger son to get tested. He's 29 and his brother was 29 when he was diagnosed. (Sorry, this came on my FYP - thought I was in the colon cancer subreddit.)
Please get checked for Lynch Syndrome it's a genetic condition that puts you at a predisposition for digestive/colorectal and reproductive cancers
Yes especially from midland. My MIL had breast cancer, raised in Midland. Along with many many of her family members with different types of cancer.
Michigander, diagnosed with colon cancer at 26. 🙋🏻‍♀️
Dow Chemical
Worked at DOW Chemical for many years and can tell you the worst pollution is in the ground. It is so bad they can't even clean it up without causing even more pollution. Absolutely do not drink ground water in the area around the plant. That little gated landfill on Rockwell has some houses just a quarter mile from it and shouldn't exist. They know it is there, and they know it leaks into the river sometimes. They will tell you there is remediation from the RGIS system, but what they fail to tell you is it leaks over top that system, especially when they build and drive pilings into the ground. Do not swim or eat fish out of the Tittabawassee, before or after Dow, it is polluted before it even reaches Dow. There is liquid tar under the soil of Dow, right up to the river, have seen it, also have seen the ground under Dow spontaneously combust when exposed to air. There are accidents that leak into the air sometimes, it happens, but Midland is only real danger of that in the summer since the wind blows to Freeland in the winter.
I’m so sorry to hear this. Agree, the proximity to Dow is super suspect. I’m curious if you or your other siblings have other health risk factors? Is everyone healthy weights and active?
You live in midland, enough said. Time to go on a deep dive into health.
Probably Dow dumping all those chemicals
Dow is what’s going on. Stay out of the water and don’t eat wildlife from the flood/river basin or river/bay system. They should be able to blood test you for dioxin as well.
Fellow Michgander from the thumb side of the bay. It's very similar over here. My aunt had colon cancer in her 50's with no family history, and the overall cancer rate is higher than where I currently live (not in Michigan).
Grew up in Midland but moved when I was 9 (34 now). My dad worked for Dow (Corning) and had colon cancer about 20 years ago. He has since had to get yearly colonoscopies and it’s not rare to have a polyp or two turn up every couple of years that needs to be removed.
I’m so sorry this is happening to your family. 


Just here to say that I noticed a lot of people from Michigan with psoriatic arthritis too. My sister and I both got it in our early 20s. Dax Shepherd is from MI and he has it, too. My mom is from St. Clair shores and died at 62 from cancer. 

The EPA didn’t regulate/fine for toxic waste dumping from places like DOW or 3M until 1978….
Not from midland but from mid michigan. My first polyp I was 32. I don't have any siblings though. Dad had polyps but dud not take care of himself. 

Do you think it's Dow related?
The Tridge is radioactive :(
Just FYI, they've already settled all the class suits related to the dioxin stuff.  Plus,  most of the midland stuff too has already been adjudicated and settled.

Here's the EPA resolution. => https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/dow-chemical-company-settlement#:~:text=Dow%20violated%20the%20Clean%20Air,air%20pollutants%20from%20industrial%20sources.
Look up superfund sites or toxic waste dumping locations in your general area. Folks don't realize how grossly contaminated much of Michigan is.
38 and I just had two big polyps removed that were also pre-cancer. I live in southern California
My step dad had pre cancerous colon polyps removed 25 years ago and he's still kicking. Polyps aren't a death sentence if they're removed. Colon cancer is highly treatable.  My grandmother had breast cancer in 2003 and she lived 20 more years. My mom's been living with the worst form of lung cancer (small cell)  for 6 years going on 7. I'm in Macomb county. Chemicals from the St Clair River nick named chemical alley have shown up at the water treatment plant. The chemicals are known to cause cancer and we're all drinking it. Should be illegal but nothing ever changes. The corporations own this place.

This map of industrial polluters shows the entirety of Midland as a hotspot due to DOW chemical.
This reminds me of Erin Brockovich
Dow chemical, man. Cancer rates have been high in midland for a long time, and that’s also why the cancer research center exists there.
Everyone is mentioning Dow, of course. But seems not so many are aware of the PBB poisoning 9 million people. [https://greatlakesecho.org/2010/06/04/poisoning-michigan-an-author-revisits-the-most-widespread-contamination-30-years-later/](https://greatlakesecho.org/2010/06/04/poisoning-michigan-an-author-revisits-the-most-widespread-contamination-30-years-later/)
As tragic as it sounds, this is a known issue!

>Plant workers employed before 1981 diagnosed with various cancers are entitled to special benefits. Lung cancer, esophageal cancer, laryngeal cancer, pharyngeal cancer, stomach cancer, colon cancer, rectal cancer, and mesothelioma are frequently caused by asbestos exposure. Asbestos-laced products were used for decades at Dow Chemical. Neither employees nor management were aware of the asbestos risk.

>Asbestos is a mineral that in its natural state is harmless. It becomes harmful when it is pulled apart or ground up into flexible fibers. Then, when inhaled or swallowed, microscopic asbestos fibers may be permanently affixed to body tissue. Over many years, these fibers may cause genetic changes that can lead to cancer. According to the National Cancer Institute, "It can take from 10 to 40 years or more for asbestos-related cancers to appear."

>To compensate cancer victims and the families of deceased cancer victims, Federal Bankruptcy Courts have required asbestos manufacturers to set aside hundreds of millions of dollars in private trusts. Through these trusts, cancer victims can receive money damages by the filing of timely, detailed, and accurate claims.

>Norris Injury Lawyers has announced a specific initiative to assist Dow Chemical employees in recovering money set aside for them in these asbestos trusts.

Members of my family believe this has impacted health for some of us. Colon cancer has not been one (yet) though.
Definitely would not be surprised if it was environmental. I did my thesis research on dioxin. Superfund has given a lot of money to researchers in MI to study dioxin-induced health effects and to clean up the area. Dioxin is a nasty chemical that just bioaccumulates in your body and doesn't really break down. Sending well wishes to you and your family <3
Mr. Babich, and I know I'm getting that spelling wrong, the history teacher from MHS relocated after one of his teens got cancer.  Lived close to the tridge.  I'll start monitoring early, thanks.
First off, I am so sorry that you and your family are going through this. I cannot imagine how confusing and painful that must be for you.

I would encourage you (and anyone else in a similar situation) to look into any active clinical trials that focus on colon cancer in younger adults. Many trials perform lots of testing and evaluations that are grant-funded and help gain insight into potential causes. The principal investigators and research staff are usually pretty easy to get in touch with by email and could point you in the right direction as well.

Sending you and your family lots of good vibes, prayers and strength.
Being you mentioned, Midland and my being from Saginaw. I'm gonna say Dow has to be involved somehow.
Hoping you all come out of this healthier than ever
Oof. That’s a lot. 

I have a pathogenetic BRCA-1 mutation that has affected our family as young as mid 20s. One of these cancers was pancreatic in my father in his 40s. 

I also have seborrheic dermatitis which is due to an overgrowth of malassezia yeast on my skin. 

Malassezia yeast is known to thrive in highly lipid, humid, and tropical environments. In the past few years, there has been a focus on how the yeast and gut mycobiome and dysbiosis may contribute to colon and pancreatic cancers.

Malassezia is more abundant in patients with colorectal cancer than in healthy people.

I suspect the increase is due to, in large part, the earth warming at an astronomic rate. 

Might be worth having a stool sample checked for fungii and yeast.

I also wonder if there is a correlation between breast cancer mutations and the micro/mycobiome?

I had a colonoscopy last winter. Precancerous polyp removed. It was an 8 out of 10 on the scale (don't know the name of the scale but determines when it is precancer vs actively cancerous)

I'm so lucky I had the colonoscopy.
DOW = 127 matches --ya think /s
First im sorry for whats happened to you. Awful situation. I hope everyone can become healthy. 
Second. This is very interesting to me. As my grandfather who was born in midland raised in saginaw/baycity michigan and currently lives in kawkawlin got stage 3 colon cancer a couple years ago, luckily on the way to remission now. But it is lynch syndrome and my father has the gene(from that area too). As well as me(born ans raised in gr). I am 25 now. Have gotten colonoscopies and endoscopies since and am clear for now. Both my father and grandfather are also prediabetic alcoholic chainsmokers. I am the opposite. 
Just interesting to hear someone from michigan at all mention lynch syndrome. Most people ive talked to have never heard of it.
I was born and raised in the Midland area in the 90s (yep my dad worked for Dow), and I had thyroid cancer when I was 21. At the same time my mother had breast cancer (BRCA negative). Dad had prostate cancer at one point. My oldest brother had a precancerous polyp removed during his routine colonoscopy, so we've all needed to start screens at 35. As far as I know none of the rest of us have had polyps or anything yet. Lots of cancer though.

Didn't see this link posted so I thought I would..
Fucking Dow.
I’m not from Michigan but came across this on the main feed. My dad died of stage 4 colon cancer when he was 43 several years ago, my mom just beat stage 2 a few months ago, and I get colonoscopies every 2 years because I have precancerous polyps every time they check. I’m 27. My doctor told me to find an environmental lawyer because the odds we all naturally got it before 50 in one family is so low. You are not alone and this stuff is happening across the country.
What a jolt to see this post. My best friend was from Midland, born in the 80s and passed away from stage 4 colon cancer at 32. Incredibly healthy, no family history, I still sometimes feel shocked about it and think of her every day. Best of luck to your family <3
Dude, my family is from Bay City and growing up we were told to never swim in the Bay or the rivers near Midland. I never understood until I saw a two-headed fish.
my mom grew up in Farmington Hills, Michigan, where their house stands used to be a garbage dump in the early 1900s every single person in my mom‘s childhood home was diagnosed with some sort of cancer or debilitating illness. My grandma (acute myeloid leukemia, as well as breast cancer and skin cancer)and grandpa (liver cancer) both died as a result my mom‘s older sister died of brain cancer that spread within 4 months, my mom’s other sister had breast cancer and had to have a double mastectomy, and my mom has brain tumors, as well as MS. I truly believe that they are all sick because of the land that they grew up on. What  really makes me think that the land is what caused all of this is that my grandpa cheated on my grandma-  my mom has another sister that was raised in a different household, she is the same age as my mom.
That daughter is not sick and has not had any type of illnesses or cancer.
Following because, yes, everyone there I know is sick, will be visiting soon but made a comment to my cousin about it. Chemical alley right?  Literally, is anyone healthy is the area? Zero people on my mom's side of the family are healthy-ALS, cancer, heart issues, hysterectomy's, dementia, omg the list goes on. Thank you for posting about this.
I'm 29. I haven't been screened yet but this last week I had to have emergency colon surgery for diverticulitis. My bowel had perforated and I was in the very very early stages of sepsis. I am currently recovering from a successful surgery. 

I was born and raised northwest of Chicago, just south of Michigan.

Sorry it doesn't totally fit, but I thought it was really odd to see this post today. My surgeon told me what I have usually isn't an issue until your 60s.
I don’t live in Michigan any longer but was born and grew up in southeastern/mid-Michigan, and my family are all still there.

There are 12 houses on the street I grew up on. 12 out of 12 houses have someone who either died of cancer or who currently has cancer. Brain, breast, bladder, prostate, colon, lung. I can name every single one. 

I made it out early on, but I was diagnosed with a rare disease (primary immune, not autoimmune, and zero familial genetic component, which puts me in the category of environmental causation). A cousin that grew up and lived just up the road developed ALS. Two very good friends that I grew up with in the same area were both diagnosed with rare diseases (different from mine). My uncle has issues and he & I both are the only ones who regularly get checked and monitored for colon cancer. Doing some digging after I was first diagnosed, the rate of neurological conditions in the area across age populations is abnormally high. 

Dow Chemical, GM, etc. is part of it, definitely. The other part is the arsenic levels present in the Mississippian Marshall Sandstone, which is the bedrock aquifer. If you live in MI and had well water… congratulations, you were exposed to arsenic in your drinking water which causes cancers, neurological issues, and a host of other health conditions that has no genetic familial component… the only commonality is you all used the same water. 

[This is an older article](https://www.michiganpublic.org/environment-science/2014-07-01/michigans-arsenic-problem-is-among-the-worst-in-the-nation-heres-why-that-matters)
and there’s probably something more recent out there, but I don’t feel like digging and this is the one I’ve had saved for years. USGS has tons of data on it as well.
I have lynch sydrome positive test.

Pretty much know how Im gonna die! Hit by a car while rollerblading for sure.
I don’t have colon cancer but I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis around 2015 and I grew up in Ottawa county.
Midland for $500 Alex. 🙁 I am sorry to hear this.  But as a Saginaw County resident, Cancer has hit me also.
Grew up in Midland till I was 34 (45 now). Everyone in my family gets some type of cancer. My grandpa had colon cancer. Aubt died of breast cancer. My Dad had colon cancer. Literally everyone, aunts/uncles etc. It's a joke in my famiky that cancer is a when, not an if. I've always wondered about the impact of Dow. :-/
Worked in Midland for 5 years. Went and had Stage 0 Melanoma removed at 32 years old. Thankfully I took a remote job and now live elsewhere in MidMich. Add another one to your statistics my friend.
Look up PFAS in Rockford, MI
I was born in Upper Michigan. My mom was born near Detroit. I have a rare birth defect of my reproductive system that I had to get corrected at hurley hospital in flint.  I asked the Dr why he would practice out of flint and he said that these rare defects are almost exclusive to the Midwest and in particular, Michigan.
I'd put money on it being related to Dow's presence. I live out of state but do work in hazmat remediation. For something so regulated, sketchy things still happen or what they say is fine because it's within regulations doesn't make it safe.
OP, you have the right idea to look for this correlation.  This is an example of the type of study you want to find.  I’m sorry this is happening to you all.

Currently a DuPont employee in southern Michigan for about 2 years. We work mostly with industrials and urethane adhesives down here but all of our raw material comes directly from Midland. Just yesterday I was watching Ken Burns' Vietnam War and learned that DOW was directly involved in the war creating chemical weapons such as Napalm and 'Agent Orange.' 

I was talking to my sister after finding this out as well as my discovery that there's a ring of cancer patients surrounding Midland and the DOW HQ. She then directed me to this post this morning.

This is somewhat alarming for me, and although our facility doesn't necessarily spew hellish chemicals into the atmosphere, our drainage system goes right into local rivers where I, and many others, like to kayak and fish. I handle the material on a daily basis and it always gets on my body. I'm also Vietnamese. 

Currently looking for a new job elsewhere.
I’m an onc rn. So many patients are from midland. High rates of leukemias and lymphomas too.
Midland says it all. 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟
Also from Michigan, also Colon Cancer in my 30s.  I did have a family history (outside of Michigan
As well) but genetic testing came up negative.
I’m in Saginaw for a Nurse Education work trip and as a chemo nurse, I went to one of the infusion centers out here and had a very similar conversation about this with another nurse. One of the things I’ve noticed is the large number of patients receiving chemo regimens for colon cancers and breast cancers and the infusion nurse stated that a lot of it was likely due to the DOW plant being nearby. According to her, several of the patients don’t have any genetic predisposition for these cancers and a lot of them are young, in their 30s. It’s fascinating but so sad!
My husband was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer at 39 and was born in Midland. Doctors didn’t think it was cancer and dismissed his symptoms. Luckily I knew something wasn’t right and insisted on a second opinion. Removal of half his colon and chemo thankfully worked. He celebrated 5 years cancer free in January.
The “Dow” dome!
Dow has DEFINITELY is the cause of cancer in Midland and surrounding areas. 
My Aunts land/soil was so contaminated the condemned her property and Dow bought it. They made her sign an NDA.
They are very powerful, the attorneys in that area are either afraid or financially influenced by Dow.
It’s a shame, but it’s 100% the reason for the cancer clusters in mid-Michigan
When we moved to Midland in the mid 70’s everybody knew you didn’t want to be down wind of the plant.
I owned a home right out. Lock stock and barrel. I sold it because I am 98 percent certain toxins from that home killed my mom and I didn’t want to deal with it. I’m sorry to who moved in. She died from cancer. I’m sorry I didn’t say anything. I just didn’t want to die from ingesting anything more. Now I live in a condo with water issues so I’m screwed either way. When someone gifted  you real estate - keep it. Bulldoze if you have too just keep it
This is what happens when people keep voting for Christian conservative republicans
From northwest and my brother was diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer in 2020 shortly after my parents and I were screened. Parents had no polyps, I had two polyps removed. All tested for a gene mutation and it came back as hereditary from my mother’s side.
Alcohol?
From my medical background, there definitely seems to be an environmental cause if it’s been determined this type of cancer is non-genetic.
Vote for Trump and he will dismantle the EPA and remove all restrictions on pollution. You get what you vote for.
Maybe it’s the house you grew up in?

Polyps are pretty common. Not a clear indicator that something systemic is going on.
Brother died at 36 stage 4 stomach cancer after a 4 week diagnosis.

Mother had colon cancer year prior, got the tumor removed has been in remission.

2nd oldest brother had cancerous polyp in his kidney at 28, also had it removed.


We all frequent Michigan, Flint, Detroit, Grand Rapids.


I’m 29 and after 3 of my immediate elder family members got cancer, I’ve honestly been waiting for it to happen to me. I got screened too and they said not to worry. But America profits off training doctors with antiquated bias education and then mass profiting, through insurance, care and medicine.


Glad you’re speaking up. You’re more than likely going to find a common cause.
💉s and food and water … the FDA is owned by large corps…. They’ve been slowly killing us for a while 😫💀🤪
Have you had genetic testing done? There can be a genetic component to colon cancer, it also pre-disposes you to be more susceptible to melanoma. It’s similar to the braca-2 gene that is linked to breast cancer.
What were everyone’s symptoms?
Gosh I’m sorry about this - but you have our support. 

I’d definitely go after Dow.
Many, many years ago Dow had a plant in Rocky Flats, CO - they had a settlement with many of the families of workers who had died from working there. Paid out in mid 2000s .  Can’t remember exact amount but over $40,000 per family

I'm sorry my friend. I think we are all going to end up with cancer. From the microplastics in our food/water/ground/lungs/balls/dicks/blood-brain barrier.....to the PFAS in every drop of water on earth, Including rain water....and all of the other stuff we haven't even realized yet.

Cancer is coming for all of us.
Did you all get genetic testing done?
Never been to Midland and lives in Southeastern Michigan pretty much all my life. 

Best of luck with your investigation.
5,500 Americans are diagnosed with cancer every damn day.
Although mostly associated with anal cancer, I wonder if HPV is playing a role? I have seen some studies that find HPV markers in some colon cancers.  They are also finding these markers in throat, tongue, tonsil cancer, and I imagine it might affect the entire gastrointestinal tract, especially with how popular oral and anal sex are without protection.
You say there is no known genetic component. When you/they got genetic testing done, did the same doctor look at all of your results together? Did you get back any results of variants in genes with unknown cancer risk?

I study the genetics of inherited colon cancer, so I'm particularly interested in this early onset cluster in your family.
I mean Dow…….
My mother and family grew up in Freeland. My grandmother had a business on the Tittabawasee River a long time ago (1960s). My mother, her sister, her father, grandfather and aunt all passed with a variety of cancer. I have always wondered....
I'm sorry if I missed this, but did you or your family members have any specific symptoms?
Omgosh my thoughts and prayers are with you all. Despite the environmental hotspots Is there any possibility of a similar diet you all may be consuming or used to? Like do all of you love eating a certain thing or all drink or drank from the same well or idk but since you all have it I’m thinking there could be a link in something that may be dietary that if you get rid of going forward would help in the future
This is pretty scary information. Do the county health departments keep these records?
You need genetic testing as well. There are several different mutations that increase cancer risk as well as some different tumor syndromes. 
Livingston county also has a lot of juvenile diabetics. Also from a similar time period
What symptoms did you all notice that prompted you to get checked out and eventually diagnosed?
From the zoo, grams, aunt and 2 cousins got it. Nothing for me yet.
Have you had genetic testing yet? The BRCA gene defects that we tend to think of as associated with breast cancer lead to an increased likelihood of all kinds of different cancers.
Thanks DOW
Plastic
I'm sorry, I wish you and your siblings the best in your recovery
I would move. If you can’t filter the fuck out of your water with a bone char filter and something from clearly filtered and a whole house filtration system like aquasuansa (sp?)
Man-made forever chemicals? Nano plastic found in all human tissue now? I’m sorry bro and concerned for our children.
Your situation sounds awful. I’d call the MI Toxic Hotline and report an unusual pattern of cancer you are concerned about. Toxicologists/epidemiologists will investigate the matter. If not MI toxic hotline, call the Division of Environmental Health. 

However, not all patterns of cancer have an environmental link, and just because DOW is in the area, you’d need specific places/routes of exposure and chemicals you are concerned about (https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/substances). Furthermore, environment can also mean alcohol and tobacco use, obesity, etc. (not saying this is your situation, just elaborating)

it’s complicated investigating a chronic disease/cancer incidence in a specific geographic area, so if you go this route experts may disagree with your claims. Be prepared to be let down, but any data that is pulled will go into a report (most likely)
Hmmmm, I wonder if Dow Chemical could be involved?
Damn Dow chemical…
Wow this is super helpful. My sister was diagnosed with colon cancer in her mid 30's with no prior family history. Our family lived in Kent county. I see that this is a hotspot for that cancer...

We lived less than 5 minutes from the Wolverine tannery in Rockford that was poisoning the water for years with PFAS. Can you guess what repercussions happened for Wolverine ? Nothing. And yet everyone keeps getting cancer or has autoimmune disorders. 

Would love to see multiple myeloma on your chart some day. I suspect this is also on the rise in Kent County.
this is amazing. great work
Thanks for this link! I was able to check a suspicion I had about the area my in-laws are from. My husband's family has been eaten alive by cancer, and it turns out their home county as well as its neighbors are RED. I hope my husband escapes the curse as he did all he could to get away from his spawn point.
This is awesome
This doesn’t indicate a cluster. These are rates of incidence by county.  It has nothing to do with a cluster nor does it indicate what you think it does.  Cancer cluster is an epidemiological term with a definition.  This isn’t even remote related. -A. Toxicologist
This is well known at Umich hospital, see a specialist please!
https://www.ewg.org/tapwater/

See what's in your drinking water.
I always wondered if there was something like this! I found it extremely suspicious that 3 girls college - high school age all had thyroid cancer in my county within a 5 year period.
This is nicely put together. Cancer cluster does have a specific meaning and while it may seem minor it’s is not trivial to use terminology according to it’s established meaning so that discussions remain clear. This was really emphasized to us in my graduate school studies. It’s the only way language remains clear.
You folks all need to exchange contact info and pursue a lawsuit. It won’t bring your loved ones back, but it very well could save lives. 

Have you tried the at home colon ca test? I think you can get it at CVS. 

Best of luck to you. 
I’m sorry, but please see a doctor. You either have cancer or you don’t, the doc won’t change that, but they could help you beat it or at least give you the heads up to make end of life plans. There’s no situation where ignoring your health is a good idea.
49m raised in Midland (lived there until early 20s) and neither I nor any of my siblings have developed any kind of cancer. Best to go see a doctor if it’s a concern because I think it’s best if they catch whatever you’ve got early.
I'm sorry.
I am so very sorry for your loss. It’s terrifying at how fast this cancer spreads. 
I just wished that doctors and insurance companies thought the same.
I'm currently unsatiated eating my jello lunch in preparation of tomorrows scopes (endo and colon). This makes me feel a lot less hungry.
>  it doesn't compare to the fight you will face

That's the best part of being poor, can't afford to fight cancer even if I get it. What's the point of being tested?
A cluster that significant in their part of town, with such a cluster within their own family isn’t simply “on the rise in younger people”. There’s clearly something in the air, in the water. Heavily diluted where they are located.
“Midland had the third-highest cause for concern, with residents facing cancer levels 8.5 times above the EPA’s acceptable risk. This means one in 1,200 people has an excess lifetime cancer risk due to the industrial sources in the area. “

That was my thought, honestly. I wish I had money to sue because this is ridiculous.
As soon as I read this post I was thinking Midland or Whitehall. Dow Chemical or The old Tannery. Definitely Dow.
Yep. It’s [Dow](https://www.mlive.com/news/saginaw-bay-city/2023/01/epa-proposes-54m-settlement-with-dow-for-dioxin-cleanup-work.html).
Hate to agree about something so awful, but no way around this
💯
Killing millions and no one cares. It's insane.
And yet we still need to BEG doctors for colonoscopies or other screening procedures. Insurance companies are just like🙈🙉if you’re under 40.
There was a study within the last year that was pretty clear that it's ultra processed "food". Several experts have even stopped calling it food and started calling it something like "industrially made edible product".   
     
> lower intake of fiber    
    
I think this is a very big one that warrants pointing out. We see a ton of shit all the time about how fiber is good and how you should eat more fiber. But I've never seen any of those things mention how much fiber, so I looked it up. Adults should be getting 30-40g of fiber per day. Having now made it a point to hit the 30g/day threshold, I am extremely confident most Americans have never hit that amount a day in their lives.   
    
*Of course* we're getting colon cancer. We haven't been eating real food and have been neglecting a major important factor of our GI health.   
     
EDIT: Since some people are talking about how to get that much: Beans. The "no salt added" black beans at Kroger seem to be the best at 31.5g of fiber per can, but in general beans are between 22-30g/can.
When I read that low fiber diets can lead to colon cancer, I started eating fiber like my life depended on it. I eat around 50 - 60 grams of fiber a day now. I think it is double the recommendation by doctors. 

My diet is now all fish, beef, chicken, eggs, fruit, potatoes, rice, beans, and veggies.
There are certainly environmental causes, like OP’s proximity to Midland. However, for the rest of the US population living in mostly safe areas, this spike of colon cancer in young people is almost fully tied to the garbage “food” that is rampantly available and is allowed to be called ‘food’ by the FDA. There are countless studies on the importance of gut health. The sugar dense American diet was never meant for the human body.
I've been randomly searching "does <blank> mess up your gut health?" with <blank> being anything that isn't real, actual food, and there's usually a study that suggests the answer is yes.  It's like how we're finding out that micro plastics are literally everywhere but we don't quite understand the implications yet. I'm willing to bet we'll find out in a few years that everything that isn't real meat, fruit and vegetables grown without pesticides/growth hormones/etc fuck up our gut biome and eventually causes colon cancer.

Edit: for example. If you search "does glyphosate cause cancer" you get an "unlikely" study. But if you search "does glyphosate mess up the gut microbiome" you get an unequivocal "Glyphosate can kill beneficial bacteria in the gut, such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium." And what happens after that? Well, your GI tract gets fucked and you're going to get a range of issues, and those two probiotics are linked to... you guessed it, not having colon cancer.
France has one of the highest rates and they are linking it to processed meat.
every meal is a choice. eat like your life depends on it.
1,000,000% processed food. It’s now 60% of our diet.
I read somewhere what excessive wiping can increase the odds of colon cancer by 50 %. When I eat like garbage my digestive health is definitely affected. I recently got a bidet and feel 1000 times better when it comes to digestive health, and personal cleanliness, and health. I just feel better before during and after using bathroom now. And even when I do eat extra hot stuff or bad foods cleanup is still as simple as water n dry off, no aggressive in contact repeated physical effort continuously to get clean. Little 10-20 second water jet n dry off. My bum feels night and day better. I feel like died as mentioned above combined w this issue are hugely important to study.
and lead is infinitely easier to find (and deal with) than whatever crap Dow has discharged into the Tittabawassee River.
Midland gets its water pumped in from lake Huron a significant distance away. Not saying it's not an environmental contamination, but it's not Midland's municipal water, it's actually some of the cleanest in the country. 
There are thousands of cities with higher lead contamination than Flint. It's not sexy to talk about that though.

Thousands of cities have it worse than Flint

I am so sorry about your mom. Cancer is horrible. My husband’s family is littered with it. At what age did you get your genetic testing done? I am beyond worried about my kids. My SIL passed at 42, diagnosed only a couple months before she passed. My MIL only had a few months too. Her sister, and that sister’s son both passed of aggressive cancer. 

I wish I had had my husband genetic tested before procreated with him 😣
My wife is going through the same thing right now, she is 46 and it's Hell. I'm sorry you and yours are going through it. Much love.
[deleted]
I’m so sorry you’re dealing with this, too. It’s unfair.
Shit, I’m so sorry you have to deal with that! It’s rough. He doesn’t have anything associated with Lynch Syndrome or any other genetic markers that are typically associated with it.
Union Carbide? Not a great safety record.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhopal_disaster
Too true. I hope this gets more upvotes.
What were your symptoms pre-diagnosis?
You are technically correct, which is the best kind of correct. But yeah, it’s just really disconcerting to know it could have developed into cancer.
Welcome to the environmental justice movement ✊🏻
Polybrominated Biphenol, a cousin of PCBs
The chemical plants up the st clair river both on the CAN and US side.  

There has been a cancer hot spot in St Clair county for decades.
relevant doc from Vice on PFAS in meat and dairy in MI  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9GTa3a-tFo
I asked to stay awake during mine. Doesn’t seem worth it to go to sleep to me. 😆
 The pipe where Midland gets its water from, out of lake Huron, can be seen on the way to Tawas right off 23.  I believe from off the road there it travels out another mile.   So midland has great drinkable water.
Not to my knowledge. Just an average diet for us. I also have celiac that developed later in life, but that’s only improved my diet.
We’ve done the genetic testing. There is no genetic component to his cancer.
None of us are drinkers since our dad was an alcoholic.
Yup. No Lynch syndrome, no other genetic markers. The types of cancer that run in our family are skin and lung, but we believe lung is from the heavy smokers in past generations. Otherwise, it’s pretty dang normal out here for us.
We moved around after I turned 5. We were only in Midland for about that long, with the youngest being there 3 years. But we stayed in mid-Michigan or the Thumb for the most part.
I literally say we had genetic testing done in the post, but yes. There is NO genetic component to this one. No Lynch syndrome or anything.
The youngest had blood in his stool. Thought it was hemorrhoids, turns out it was cancer. He was healthy otherwise. The rest of us got checked because the youngest had it and doctors recommended screening the rest of us.
I have yet to get genetic testing myself, but I’m going to be asking for it this coming physical.
Similar things happened in Parkersburg, West Virginia, where I was born, and it has everything to do with a DuPont facility there. There’s a documentary called “the devil we know”. I have relatives that got money from the settlement and aunt died from liver cancer after recovering from breast cancer while simultaneously having cancer at the same time as a neighbor. It wasn’t innocent lack of foresight but a conscious choice that these companies make and still nobody has gone to jail.
I'll never forget the time, back when I moved to Saginaw back in the 00's. I had been living there about a week when, on a particularly clear and calm day, I saw a huge pillar of black smoke on the horizon reaching up into the sky. I had the day off and decided to "drive up that way to see what's on fire."

It was a half hour drive, and there was no fire, it was just Dow. It cannot be healthy to live by that place.
St Clair county…is that the Sarnia plant?
Bingo. My environmental science class at SVSU spent a few weeks covering how horrible DOW chemical was (and currently still is) and the damages they’ve already done (and are still doing) to our beautiful and beloved Michigan. I wish I could post some pictures or links but I’m having troubles ATM. Maybe the sub doesn’t allow.

Edit: Fixed past/present-tense switching
And PFOF/PFAS. That area has a lot up there. My friend lives in Millington and they have their water checked by the EPA once a year. I read the most disturbing article on PFOS recently. It’s worth the read. If you can’t read it free try going on Facebook and going to The NY Times page. I was able to read it going through there.

Would never live near any plant for this reason. There's so much we don't know about how all this stuff effects us, and a lot we do that scares me
Dow and also dupont (plastic manufacturing facilities) they totally dump hexachloroine all into the great lakes which totally seeps into our drinking water!!!!
A clarification on Wolverines “repercussions”: Wolverine was sued by citizens as well as The State of Michigan and was court-ordered to, among other things, finance and perform sampling to determine the extent of PFAS contamination, fund and facilitate municipal water extensions or institutional controls for affected homes, fund a financial assurance mechanism to provide for future response activities, reimburse the state of Michigan for legal fees and environmental investigation work, and leaves the door open for the State to recover natural resource damages against Wolverine. It’s not perfect, but it’s not nothing.

My brother, sister, me, and both my daughters all have Lynch Syndrome. My brother and I had colon cancer, my sister and oldest daughter had uterine cancer. The town we all grew up in had an Aidex Pesticide plant, and a battery plant, along with the largest railyard in the US (in the 50's and 60's). My brother lived in southern Texas, and he died from metastasized prostate cancer. Also, living in the Midwest is in itself a cancer problem due to all the pesticides and herbicides in the ground water and air,
Was it Kent County? Know a few people in the area who got cancer who wondered how they got it. They forget about Rockford having a leather tannery that dumped forever chemicals for years.

Always makes me wonder about the RV Campground on the Grand River in Grand Haven. That thing is built right on top of a former tannery there as well.
https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/michigan_diseaseclusters.pdf
Can you expand on that? I know nothing about this and genuinely curious why the red areas wouldn’t indicate a cancer cluster.
“Isn’t even remotely related” seems like a stretch. I’m not an epidemiologist, but I’d guess that the highest rates by county might be at least second cousins to cancer clusters
https://witl.com/michigan-cancer-counties/
I can't comment on whether your specific reasoning is correct, but the idea Midland doesn't have a higher than average cancer incidence, given the fucking Dow chemical plant, is laughable. Idk if that's ignorance or you're being disingenuous.     

Source: Colon cancer with no genetic component in my 30s from spending the vast majority of my life in Louisiana's now-infamous cancer alley. Also lived near Midland briefly. 
If you’re really a toxicologist, maybe hop on google scholar so you can research the multiple peer reviewed studies demonstrating cancer clusters in midland and near similar petrochemical operations before talking out of your ass.

Semantics. I wouldn’t move there.
At home colon cancer testing you can get at the drug store? I had no idea!
I’m sorry about your sweet wife. I was looking down the same tunnel 15 years ago at age 39 with a 2 year old.  It’s terrifying. 

Just putting this resource out here 

The colonclub.com is a wonderful resource for people diagnosed before age 50. The people are so lovely and scraped me off the ceiling when I was beyond panicked I couldn’t breathe. 

There is zero reason I should have been loaded with polyps at age 39. Nobody in my family gets cancer. The GI doctor humored by GP by doing the colonoscopy, because he didn’t think I needed it. 

One more year I’d probably have been stage II or III. Mine has no genetic component. 

Holding your wife up in my thoughts with light and love. Colon cancer is a cruel beast.
Honestly, the hunger and the nasty salty liquid were the only parts that were difficult for my colonoscopy. I got my IV, fell asleep and woke back up and it was all done. No negative things afterwards, life back to normal. Good luck to you.
Because you will likely be eligible for Medicaid/Medicare and Social Security disability if you are diagnosed and there are many systems and charities in place to help cancer patients, so the point is that you are loved by others and others will want you to try and stay in their lives.
It would probably have to be a class action lawsuit. Can you find out about other families in your area dealing with the same thing? Reminds me of Erin Brockovich.
Attorney's will work for a percentage of the case's proceeds if the case has a good chance of going in your favor. Definitely reach out for a free consultation.


If you don't mind me asking, what street or area did you live in? We're in the Chestnut Hill school area.


Did you play outside in the dirt/mud often? Tap water? Local food, or grocery store food?
I'm pretty sure if you speak to an attorney, and they think you have a case, an arrangement can be made. Especially if even a dotted line can be drawn to Dow.
Check out the documentary "the devil we know." Sounds like you could be living through something similar.
Yeah that’s some Erin Brockovich shit!
Every time I hear the name Dupont, I think about the 4 or 5-part piece the Intercept did on them.

They poisoned the planet. The entire fucking planet. Every water source known, save for maybe Mars, is contaminated. They've ruined lives. They've poisoned countless families, environments, animals. They've doomed babies.

It enrages me. There are many atrocities in the world, but I can't think of any other with such impact. Honestly I'd lose my mind if I were in your shoes.
How close did you guys grow up to the plant off Saginaw road? Have any of you ever worked there?
That these companies are allowed to operate and no one is criminally charged is insane. And no one seems to care or want to actually do anything about it. How will we weather the storm of climate change if we cannot adequately hold those responsible accountable for what they've done? It only tells others that it's okay, just follow suit, you can poison families across the country and nothing will happen to you.
Damn 5.4m is nothing for them
Just say you have blood in your stool or on the toilet paper
I work for a gastroenterologist and you are correct! When you finally can get a referral for a colonoscopy it will go toward your deductible and out of pocket. They physician bill is very small, but the facility bill is outrageous. Insurances just flat out refuse to do a colonoscopy for screening purposes for anyone under age 45. Even with a family history of colon cancer as the diagnosis they bill will be the patients responsibility and with how much they charge, most people will opt not to have it. Gastro doctors for years have been believed this needs to be changed.
My sister literally had to beg for one even though she was having major colon cancer symptoms. She wrote him a letter post colonoscopy to tell how shitty that doctor was for not listening to her when it came back stage 3 colorectal cancer
Insurance companies want to catch it early too when it’s cheaper to treat.  Since financially it’s in their best interest they’re on your side this time.
You don't even need a colonoscopy anymore. There is a blood test. If you have Medicare it's covered. If you have private insurance, you wont get the test because Republicans don't care if you die and won't fund the task force that approves these types of tests.

https://wapo.st/4gctndX
My doctor made me get it. Also it was free.
Another tip that worked for me if you have a good doctor, tell them you have health anxiety and are losing sleep worrying about the rising rates of colon cancer in young people and that you have IBS and want a official diagnosis. The only way to diagnose IBS is to rule out everything else. This worked with my doctor and I got a colonoscopy 2 years ago at 35. They found precancerous polyps and I am now on a 5 year screening program. If I waited until 45 like they recommended I woulda probably had already developed cancer and would have a much bigger issue to deal with. Take control of your health and demand the care you deserve. If your doctor fights you, find a new doctor.
I was set up with genetic testing and a colonoscopy at 27 due to my mom passing in her early 40s from colon cancer. My PA at Corewell didn’t give me any trouble when I explained my concerns and it was all covered. Definitely worth trying a couple doctors until you find one who will listen.
>Having now made it a point to hit the 30g/day threshold, I am extremely confident most Americans have never hit that amount a day in their lives.

This made me wonder how much fiber I'm getting, because I feel like it's a lot. I totaled up a typical day's worth of food, and I landed at just 25g. That's wild.
My question is this is about our food, which I absolutely am not skeptical of as a contributing factor, why are there so many localized pockets where colon cancer is becoming drastically more common? Near chemical plants are the worst areas. I don't doubt our food is part of this, but it's so hard to separate from the environmental factors we have. And not just because you can't control for it easily, but also because food is a big way environmental pollutants end up in our bodies. Fiber intake is also huge, I agree. We have studies showing that dietary fiber intake is associated with reduced risk of several cancers. But also we have studies suggesting that fiber supplements might not be associated with reduced cancer risks. Part of how nutrition is pushed to us, with macronutrients and specific goals, is used against us to promote supplements that might not be anywhere near an adequate replacement for the real things. It's all so sad.
Way too much.  There is a limit to benefits.  That’s going to cause significant slowing of digestion, and get in the way of protein digestion too.  Always best to be middleground on nutritional science and personal health.  20-30g a day of real fiber (doesn’t need to be every day, health isn’t an exact routine), not added/processed fiber, and you’re good to go.
One point: beef and meat in general does have links to colon issues overall, it’s not linear, but it’s a well observed in the data.  So if you wanted to make a lasting change, it could be to cut out beef, and lower the fiber intake.   

“Heme iron in meat can cause genetic mutations and oxidative damage in the colon, which may lead to colorectal cancer. A meta-analysis of 566,607 people found that those in the highest category of heme iron intake had a 1.18 times higher risk of colon cancer than those in the lowest category.”

Beef usually has the highest proportion of heme iron.  Iron is not kind on the body over time.
Drop the beef ! 

Mediterranean diet
I've found the same issue with AI. The initial answers are straight from magazine style articles or the American Diabetes Association, American Heart Association, etc. After about three tries I'll get medical studies that contradict those answers.

Ask AI about the information being gathered by CGM use. It's kind of funny in a scary way.
It now rains glyphosate. I firmly believe it and other organophosphate pesticides are what are causing the rise in autism and other neurological based disorders. Once they started spraying heavily in the 80s there was no turning back. We are raining poison down on ourselves and the true damage won’t be known for probably another 10-20 years.
> does glyphosate mess up the gut microbiome

Looking around a quick google search, it seems that the studies are more theoretical, like testing if individual species are sensitive to glyphosate, not actually confirming anything is happening in humans. The amount of glyphosate that makes it into our diet is extremely small, well below any documented effects.
Whaaat? How in the world does excessive wiping cause colon cancer, how far are you shoving that tp up?! Wiping is on the skin between your butt cheeks, it shouldn't even be touching the rectum much never mind your colon, whaa?
Dioxin is what I’m finding a lot of, which is agent orange from my understanding. I’m wondering if there were any spills that happened right around the time we were all born (80s and early 90s) that could explain it. I’m finding time to go up to the library later in October to do some searching through old newspapers.
Yeah midland and Saginaw DO NOT USE ground water or surface water from within the counties. Dow couldn’t fuck up midlands drinking water supply without deliberately sabotaging it, and all of Saginaw too.

That said, the ground water in Midland county is REALLY FUCKED UP. The titabawasse river is REALLY FUCKED UP.   If I die young, growing up around that river will almost certainly be the cause.
I got tested through my gynecologist when I was 31 about to turn 32 and got the results after my 32nd birthday so it wasn't long ago. I'm glad I got it done it's worth knowing. The sooner you do it the better you'll feel about it. You'll have more time to take preventative measures and you'll be prepared for the worst. At this point in my life it's all about preventative measures like better diet, hydration, keeping up on my appointments and obviously the colonoscopies. 

I won't lie. It took some time to come to terms with my messy genetics but now I have the info and can help my kids too. Who knows how things will be when they're my age.
Love and wellness to you too! I’m so sorry.
Yeah he’s been vegan for 20 years. Hasn’t smoked or drank in longer—he was diagnosed at 41 from a colonoscopy (that they couldn’t even complete because the tumor was so huge). He did have some symptoms but they were minimal and his primary care told him it was just stomach upset from travel. Any,  ANY change in bowel habits, demand a colonoscopy.
It really is hell. I tell everyone I know to fight for a colonoscopy earlier, but it’s hard. Fighting insurance can be a full time job, even with his diagnosis they challenge every scan and treatment. It’s ridiculous.
You mentioned this not being genetic. Did they do genetic testing? My Director is from Iraq. Her father, she and all of her siblings have had cancer in one form or another. It was due to a gene from the father. I asked her about genetic testing. She said when they do genetic testing, they have to know what they are testing for. The way it was explained to me is they don’t run tests then wait to see what the computer spits out.
Celiac doesn't develop later in life it is diagnosed later in life. All the while you've had gut inflammation. Celiac greatly increases your chances of digestive cancer. Source: Am Celiac. Diagnosed age 40. Have to have yearly screenings due to precancerous colon findings. Dad died from colon cancer. Has your family been checked for Celiac disease?
Hi toxicologist here. You answered your question. Go google epigenetics.  It has nothing to do with you but rather the habits of the grand/parents pre conception and also during gestation and early developmental.  The copious tobacco smoke omnipresent didn’t help either.
Yeah just from a scientific standpoint, this seems like if all siblings from a family are diagnosed with the same illness, you must of had some sort of long term exposure to *something* (likely some industrial chemical) 

I agree with other commenters theories. I bet it was something in the water.
Mine at 39 had no genetic component and was tested twice for Lynch and whatever.
My symptoms were the same as your brother’s. It was written off as hemorrhoids. Glad I pushed to get scope. 

And it wasn’t even a lot of blood. I’m guessing most people would have ignored it.
Midland is Dow Chemical central
I watched Dark Waters on Netflix a couple weeks ago and that whole situation it TERRIBLE.
There's a Mark Ruffalo movie called "Dark Waters" about the lawyer who brought the case against DuPont in West Virginia and exposed them for knowing that the Teflon they were coating our pots and pans with and the chemicals they were dumping in rivers and burying under farmland was causing birth defects and cancers. The fact that so many people were willing to quite literally poison people and our only fucking livable planet in the name of money is sickening. Regulations for PFAS in our drinking water were only announced *this year*. These companies have been getting away with literal murder for decades.
I think the people who were responsible for making those decisions should be sentenced to death.
I grew up across the freeway from an auto plant. We regularly had "fume days" in grade school when the chemical fumes from the plant would be so strong on our playground that kids would get headaches or even sometimes throw up if we played outside. I have not had kids, but nearly everyone I grew up with has multiple kids with major disabilities. :( Some blame themselves as we're getting into our 40s now, but even the folks who had kids in their teens and twenties basically had the same issues. :(
My ex MIL lived near a dupont factory in Pennsylvania somewhere while growing up.  She died early to aggressive ovarian cancer within 3 months of discovery. She actually had two types.
There's a great movie about DuPont called Dark Waters and how a lawyer that used to defend them flipped on them and is the reason that we know about Teflon and PFAS.

Dupont knew how bad Teflon was and they tried to hide that from the world and a lawyer who worked for them had a conscious sense of justice and flipped on them and is one of the heroes of our time.

The people at DuPont used to like this guy and they started treating him like the scum of the earth when they found out that he was building a case against them. 

Well it's funny how the people at Dupont are actually the literal scum of the earth for poisoning the entire world and killing thousands if not millions of people, and they somehow think they have the moral right to fight against someone who is exposing their crimes. We need to bring back the guillotines and put the fear of Justice back into these people who would poison us and murder us for profit.
> It wasn’t innocent lack of foresight but a conscious choice that these companies make and still nobody has gone to jail.

It always is.  Always.
I've seen this comment before, word for word.....
I just watched dark water. It’s about that
Born and raised in Parkersburg. I don’t even want to know how C8 and DuPont’s meddling has wrecked my health. I know my asthma and permanent black bags under my eyes from allergies is more than likely because of the pollution. But is it also why breast cancer was common in my family? And why my thyroid is wonky? And who knows what else.
Yes, and many other plants in chemical valley. It’s 40% of Canada’s national refining output, concentrated in about 60 square kilometers. Nowadays there’s lanxess, aramco, nova, etc. The Dow plant was purchased and is now run by Aramco, as in Saudi Aramco, the Saudi King’s personal petrochemical company
You're right, it's not nothing, but it feels like nothing to the people who were impacted health-wise by it. I was in the FB group regarding the class action lawsuit. I don't believe any individuals received compensation for their medical woes, but I could be wrong.
Researchers found a cluster of breast cancer 
in Midland, Saginaw, and Bay counties 
between 1985 and 2002. High levels of dioxins 
and other contaminants in soil and higher-
than average body burdens of dioxins in local 
residents, particularly those who lived in the 
region prior to 1980, have also been found 
in the city of Midland and the Tittabawassee 
and Saginaw River  oodplains in Michigan. 
A 2008 study found increased breast cancer 
incidence was spatially associated with dioxin 
contamination. Researchers believed that 
the source of dioxins in the river came from 
industrial processes at the Dow Chemical 
Company Midland plant.
It's also a map of the most populated counties.

Identifying a cluster would target much smaller areas. It also requires the time variable. When and what happened is just as important as where. This map can't do any of that.

DOW is still suspect. This map just doesn't point at anything. It's coincidental and full of anecdotal data.
ELI5: DOW dumped stuff. Bad stuff.  We know what that bad stuff does.  It has little to nothing to do with colon cancer rates.  The figure is rates at the county level and says nothing of national data and wouldn’t indicate a hot spot or cluster because that takes a lot of data analyzed by ppl that know what they are doing.  Ppl want to make DOW the boogeyman for everything under the sun since they suck.
Yes, technical terms are important to respect and adhere to and yes, the map is ripe for /r/peopleliveincities, but /u/WashYourCerebellum is on the same kind of kick that that folks denying that anything was out of the ordinary at Love Canal were on when lay-people brought up how odd it was that residents were getting sick with pretty similar ailments.

The problem is that it does take time, expertise, and well-gathered data to make these very specific claims.  Too often experts, like Washy here, dismiss out of hand any hunches that exist at a higher confidence than anecdotes rather than going, "Hmm, interesting, we'll take a look at it."  *Especially* when the perpetrators are large businesses or employers, even though Washy likely has no ties to said corporations.
They have a LOT of false positives though, so if you get a positive don't panic till you've had a real colonoscopy (my parents' insurance won't pay for a colonoscopy unless they have taken Cologuard or whatever it's called first, and we've been through this year after year).
in addition to what phoenix corn said it's for cancer as well, it can't catch and remove the pre cancerous polyps that a colonoscopy can which prevents you from having cancer to begin with.
What made you decide to push for the colonoscopy?
Thank you. My grandmother died of colon cancer when she was 27 so I'm always worried I'll have it.
Fuuuuuck that. Drag my entire family through that ordeal (again, plenty of cancer going around) with a hope and prayer that when I make it out I can then overcome the debt and losses incurred during that time by going back to being a wage slave?

If there was an ACTUAL social safety net, maybe might be worth fighting. When the outcome after beating cancer for people poor like me is "back to 40-80 hours of grueling soul crushing labor" sorry nah, no point in even finding out what's killing me.

You may or may not have the benefit of family and loved ones and significant others that can help you and support you through those times but we're all working insane hours here and literally cannot stop working.

I literally cannot imagine burdening my already over worked family with something like this, just to have the possibility to go back to wage slavery.

Hard pass. Ignorance is bliss on this one unless you can AFFORD to fight cancer. For many of us it's a death sentence either way.
That’s exactly why I posted here!
Check out the documentary “the devil we know” on YouTube.  It directly involves Dow
Or [Love Canal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Canal).
chipCG Brockovitch
Erin Brockovich has in fact been involved albeit as a minor figure in the Wolverine World Wide cases in Rockford, MI.

The primary pollutant they are responsible and get the most exposure for is PFOS, but a large quantity of the same type of chromium involved in the case she is famous for has been found at their former site along the Rogue River.
We lived on Haley near Saginaw Rd. We def played outside a ton. My parents hated us in the house because there were four of us. Tap water was the only option because 90s. I remember going to Farmer Jack’s and similar grocery stores.
I grew up in that neighborhood...
Dow's annual revenue is $45 billion, so $5.4 million is about 0.01% of their annual revenue.  I make about $65 thousand per year, so this is equivalent to me paying a $6.50 fine.
Had that issue when I was like 32. Doctor immediately referred me for a colonoscopy.
Wait is that a sign of colon cancer? Because I’ve seen blood in my stool for months now  and thought it was just a fissure that’s taking forever to heal.
My dad pretty much had bloody diarrhea for years. He received numerous colonoscopies but each time he was just pretty much told, “Yeah, you got some hemorrhoids and polyps” and just send him on his way without offering any actual assistance. It wasn’t until over a year ago when his hematologist/oncologist he had been seeing for a few years due to his abnormal blood chart readings, had him referred out to another gastro doctor, who upon doing his colonoscopy was astonished at how bad my dad’s colon was. We’re talking ruptures large enough he could stick his finger in. He was offered surgery which my dad happily took and he did start showing improvements. Less bleeding, he reported having more solid stool too. Unfortunately, we were never able to find out the cause for colon issues and his other symptoms he was experiencing before his passing last year. My family is working on sending the VA his medical records right now because the VA believes the symptoms he was experiencing could be attributed to his time overseas and exposed to burn pits. The neurologist he saw during one of his visits to the ER suggested this as well.
I did, 3 different appointments and was ignored. I had to act like it was normal to him to have a lot of blood in my stool every bowel movement with NO hemorrhoids… hospital SENT ME to him bc they found a lump via scan and I was bleeding. No cancer, but two polyps removed and I grew up in Wayne County. This doctor was rude until he realized, I wasn’t lying.. I even got accused of it being my period, like I know what hole that comes from.. male drs like him I swear… A lot of people here have stomach issues that I know. Our water has never been safe growing up, and we were taken to the lakes to swim!
The insurance company I work for changed this as a perk, you’re allowed one per year regardless of age.  They’re self-insured but unfortunately most insurance companies don’t cover it until 45.
What about the self administered screenings like cologuard? It seems like something they could have everyone do pretty cheaply unless I'm missing something.
This sounds familiar, ha. I was advised to have a colonoscopy in my 20s as a precaution due to some symptoms I was having. It was the first real medical procedure I’d ever had, so I didn’t think to much about the insurance portion, I naively assumed it would be covered. 

I get to the hospital for it, weak and hangry as fuck from the last day+ of consuming nothing but laxatives, Gatorade, and chicken broth, get checked in. I’m called up to the desk told I’ll be taken back within the next 15 min or so, and also that i needed to pay $600 right then to have it done, because of _________ some explanation that sounded complex and confusing at the time. I balked at it and said I needed to call the insurance company and get this figured out (again, I was incredibly naive to how insurance for bigger procedures actually worked at the time), and was told if I wasn’t paid and ready to go back in 15 minutes, I’d have to just reschedule it when I got it figured out. 

Bail at the last minute and do the prep again? Hell no. I was so mad, it felt like something that should’ve been communicated and handled earlier than literally right before my procedure. I’m sure it wasn’t, but it *felt* manipulative, because who’s gonna bail at that point?
You have to make a really big effort to hit the recommended amount, for sure.
It's basically impossible, I manage to get to that level but only by drinking fiber supplements
25g is decent for smaller to medium women, 40g is around the upper "recommended" range for men

Also I'll get on my soapbox and mention that fiber isn't the variable to fixate on, it doesn't do anyone any good to forgo fruits and veggies for quest and fiber one bars. No idea how companies get away with their chicory root syrup schemes.

There's also the aspect of inflammation, gut microbiome, motility, and it's not even simple enough to overeat certain produce because of pesticides.

On that note motility is an underrated variable for ones health, supposedly the longer stool sits within you the more the bacteria feast on yummy fiber until they run out and switch to less preferred food and spit out byproducts that are harsh on the kidneys
What? No this is false. Recommended fiber intake for adult men is 45 GRAMS per day. 20-30 may be "normal" but is too low. Pre-industrial humans averaged 100-200g per day.  

Regarding the effects on colon motility, it highly depends on what type of fiber you are eating. It also depends on the state of your gut health, which depends on your steady state fiber intake.  

In short, eat lots of fiber.
Absolutely absurd claim. There is ZERO negative health consequences  to eating > 30g of fiber.

If I’m not mistaken, it’s moreso processed meats (jerkys, lunch meat, pepperoni etc.) that have the link to colon issues. Now you could definitely argue that regular factory farmed beef (or any factory farmed meat in general) is processed. Don’t think they’ve done a study on just those types of meats and their effects on the colon.
The American Heart Association gets funding from the beef industry.  Not sure who funds the American Diabetes Association,  but the information from these associations is skewed depending where they get their money.
I feel like those that have issues with "GMO" shouldn't be with the food itself, but all the pesticides that we coat the plants and dirt and wash into our water ways.
Neighbor, you may also want to look into the [1973 PBB contamination](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/c2128b4087d647babfd65533a29d83d1), especially if your parents lived in the most highly-effected area.
Dow did have violations for not adhering to federal environmental laws: https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/dow-chemical-company-settlement

While there isn't a definitive link between PFOS/PFOA and colorectal cancer, there is a correlation. Dow has denied manufacturing PFAS but so did Dupont and 3M.
Agent Orange is uniquely awful for the impact it can have on subsequent generations. It's still making people sick in Vietnam and the US.
Look up the EPA settlement with Dow last year. Dow admitted that it polluted the watershed with dioxins and furans for decades. Early in the 2000s is when it was discovered and I remember the yard signs in the homes along the river whose properties were contaminated.
My grandpa was a Vietnam vet who died after a five year fight with stage four colon cancer. They actually listed agent orange exposure as a contributor to his death (as far as my grandma told me)
Thank you so much for taking the time to reply. I will ask their PCP how to get their genetic testing done! They are still in their teens, so earlier would be better to try to prevent anything bad. I hate cancer so much, I’m sorry you have to deal with it in your life. Sending good vibes your way!
BC/BS are fvcking demons.
They did PHASER genetic testing, which looked for specific genetic markers for colon cancer. He had zero.
For what it may be worth, it very much -used- to be exactly the way you describe, but thankfully now things have improved. If you were to visit a place like MidMichigan, Beaumont, UM, etc. they will perform personalized or comprehensive genetic testing for folks with a concerning personal/family history.

If you have a familiar history of cancer, especially in folks under 50, in multiple successive generations, or if there seems to be a pattern this could be worth seeing a “cancer genetics program” for!
Celiac can develop later in life if it is turned on by a [viral infection](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10348803/#:~:text=Given%20this%20knowledge%2C%20it%20is,to%20the%20gluten%20protein%20and) like Covid, which is how mine started. I was diagnosed at 30. My brothers are all getting tested for it, too, but the cancer has taken priority.
The first thing I thought of was DOW!
It’s the same story in Sarnia, Ontario. Chemical valley has taken an awful toll there, especially on the south side. I know too many people who were killed by preventable cancers. There’s a big Dow presence in Sarnia too.
I live near the big refineries on the coast and a lot of times when it is supposed to rain heavily, the rain quite literally goes around us and then reforms. We call it the dow bubble.
As tragic as it sounds, this is a known issue!

>Plant workers employed before 1981 diagnosed with various cancers are entitled to special benefits. Lung cancer, esophageal cancer, laryngeal cancer, pharyngeal cancer, stomach cancer, colon cancer, rectal cancer, and mesothelioma are frequently caused by asbestos exposure. Asbestos-laced products were used for decades at Dow Chemical. Neither employees nor management were aware of the asbestos risk.

>Asbestos is a mineral that in its natural state is harmless. It becomes harmful when it is pulled apart or ground up into flexible fibers. Then, when inhaled or swallowed, microscopic asbestos fibers may be permanently affixed to body tissue. Over many years, these fibers may cause genetic changes that can lead to cancer. According to the National Cancer Institute, "It can take from 10 to 40 years or more for asbestos-related cancers to appear."

>To compensate cancer victims and the families of deceased cancer victims, Federal Bankruptcy Courts have required asbestos manufacturers to set aside hundreds of millions of dollars in private trusts. Through these trusts, cancer victims can receive money damages by the filing of timely, detailed, and accurate claims.

>Norris Injury Lawyers has announced a specific initiative to assist Dow Chemical employees in recovering money set aside for them in these asbestos trusts. Cancer victims or the families of deceased victims who worked at the plant before 1981 may call 800-478-9578 for a free evaluation of their claim.

Mark Ruffalo is amazing in that
The movie “the devil we know” is a more standard documentary without any possible Hollywood muddling of facts and goes into detail just how nefarious the whole situation is. One of the chemicals in the original Teflon configuration was called C8 or something to that effect and has been found in the blood of people across the world. They had to find blood samples from WW1 to find uncontaminated blood to establish a base line. But that chemical plant is still standing and just chugging away. The whole are is a hotbed for chemical companies. My grandfather worked for Borg/warner chemical which turned into GE chemical and lived in the same area. It’s the backbone of their economy but that’s what it cost them.
They should be sentenced to cancer.
There might be a little more circumspection if there were more than just financial liabilities to consider. At this point they just weigh the difference between potential lawsuits and potential profits.
Sadly our environmental laws are woefully inept at forcing polluters into cost-recovery for the medical bills they caused, so it’s not contemplated in the action the State took against Wolverine. 

Thankfully, Wolverine was found legally liable for the PFAS contamination, meaning anyone who wanted to personally file tort claims against Wolverine (or join a class action) were more likely to win financial recompense, but to the extent that has happened yet or not, I’m not aware of it. I’m not in the area and don’t know anyone personally involved in any class action but I hope the people in the area get the legal victory they deserve
Instead of focusing on correcting the use of a scientific term, perhaps provide some more helpful clarification as to what these red areas could mean. Washtenaw County is also very populated but not on this map.
This map is cases per 100k. It's already adjusted for population.
When you have a colonoscopy they can remove polyps right there, this prevents cancer. So even if you want to argue about affording treatment, this is affording prevention, so that you don't need treatment. I just had one Monday and they found 4 polyps. They were all removed and cannot turn into cancer now.
Have you seen Dark Waters?
As someone who grew up in peak PFAS contamination country, I’m sure I’ll be right there with you bud.
Dow did a bunch of dioxin-related cleanup along Haley about 9-10 years ago. It was a voluntary testing program and people who qualified had all of their topsoil at their residence removed and replaced and the landscaping redone. I’d recommend searching newspapers from that timeframe for more details.
So you guys were still north of the plant which complicates the Dow angle, but doesn't negate it. I'd still definitely talk with a lawyer.
I had a client on Haley who had lived there for years.  One day these people came to his house to ask questions and to make a date that they could come back and dig up some soil.  When that time came, they put on their white suits from head to toes.  They also took blood samples, etc. 

Results came back and his yard was positive for dioxin!! You'll never guess what they did for people in these cases!! They came back and took all of his grass out and laid sod.
We absolutely need percentage of revenue-based fines.
Sounds like something you should definitely be asking a doctor about. Go make an appointment yesterday.
Yea it is. It could be hemmerhoids or a fissure.  Never hurts to get checked out. I’m 28 and just got a colonoscopy because I had blood. I knew it was a hemorrhoid. Doctor knew it was a hemorrhoid but still got me in just to be safe. Months is too long to go hoping something heals. See a doctor
I had this right around when I was 26 (2017’ish), ended up being referred to a gastro and got a colonoscopy. Nothing cancerous but they did cut out a few polyps. The peace of mind is 100% worth going through the right steps to make sure you are good imo
Go get checked! I had the same thing, blood after really hard poops. I reported it to a doctor years ago and was told “you’re too young for anything serious, just eat more fiber, it’s likely from fissures”

Now I’m in my mid 30s with a new doctor, told her I had blood again and she was appalled by the previous doctor comments. Had me go get checked and during the colonoscopy they noticed a lot of hemorrhoids but also found 3 pre-cancerous polyps that they removed.
I have IBD. Blood in stool can be a sign. If it’s more than very occasional and a little bit, like a micro tear from wiping, I’d talk to a doctor. 

You don’t want to fuck with undiagnosed IBD. You can go from feeling normal to terrible in months, potentially without medication.
Have it checked. My dad had stage four colorectal cancer, and we found out because he had severe anemia. Apparently the skin of the tumors is very thin and they bleed a lot. That can show up in your stool.
It could be polyps popping, which was the case for me. I got it at 33 at the time.

Polyps can develop into cancer tho. So get yourself checked.

What motivated me was hearing about Chadwick Boseman passing from Colon Cancer, the more I read about it, I was like shit it's on the rise and I ain't getting younger.

I thought mine were gonna be hemorrhoids but nah polyps!
Bright red blood is usually from a hemorrhoid or fissure. Blood from colon cancer is usually either a dark black or can sometime congeal and look like gummy bears.  Even still, it's worth hanging a doctor check to be sure
Yeah I’d get that checked out just to be safe. Colonoscopies are not that bad, I had my first one at 17 and my second at 31. The prep doesn’t take as long as it used to and it’s great peace of mind that everything is okay.
A fissure can destroy healthy tissue. I agree with beeblebroxia, see a doc ASAP.
How dark is the blood?

Bright red is usually lower down the track and fissures and hemorrhoids 

Dark read is typically higher up but color alone doesn’t anything 

Had similar issues and was referred for a colonoscopy. My GP didn’t even make me drop my shorts. Just sent me along 

Don’t stress yourself out unless there’s stomach pain, unexplained weight loss and more happening at the same time 

A diet journal might help - salted nuts DESTROY me
What I posted moreso focused on the iron content.  While processed meat will up the chances even more, the main target now is the heme-iron.  Iron plays a central role in cancer and tumor progression.  That doesn’t mean more iron equals cancer, it just means there’s some larger equation going on, and we know iron metabolism will play at least some role.  Heme-iron is highly absorbed, iron is held on TIGHT by the body over time, the elderly consistently show iron overload in their brain (iron is now seen as a central player in brain neurodegeneration).  The average person should think more about iron depositing too much in their body rather than low iron.  It’s a serious part of aging.  I say that with many studies read and an open mind; always willing to take on new info that may change that perspective.

You could offset some of this with a win/win and become a regular blood donor.  But in the end, there’s merit to just cutting down on animal products.  Not saying people should do it, just think about it.
Definitely. I drove 8+ hours through Pennsylvania recently, a HEAVILY wooded area. Hit maybe 5 bugs with my car the entire trip. In the 90’s it would have been thousands of bugs. There’s something seriously wrong.
I was subjected to the PBB contamination in 73. I was a toddler then and we lived in rural western Saginaw county, a few miles from St Louis. My teenage son recently discovered an article that led him to studies about it and he essentially came at me with “how come you never told us?” And I didn’t know what to say. It was just another childhood event that happened which I had no control over. There was a time I could have participated in a study and had a blood draw but I lived in Chicago by then. It was a very helpless feeling to have your kid question you about what this means for their long term health.
Ohhhhhhh that’s interesting. Our dad is from Saginaw and mom is from Sebewaing. Both Boomers. I’ll do some more reading into this. Thank you for sharing!
The Legacy operations have also been in place from before those laws even existed, by multiple decades in the case of Dow and Dupont. I suspect it isn't one thing either, one compound or even class of compounds, it's a witch's brew of shit leaching from old buried drums. Impoundments so old the company has forgotten where and what they are.
My great uncle died about a decade ago from cancer caused by agent orange. He was in Vietnam and struggled with skin cancer throughout his later life.
No problem at all, if one reply can help a single person then I'm glad I replied. I hope you get things figured out and I too am sending good vibes your way!
All insurance companies are.
Make sure he checks if he’s HER2 positive. If he is, it opens up more lines of treatment!
Out where I grew up it was Motorola.
  
Groundwater pollution. Smelter pollution.
Is there anyway to shut dow down?
Same.
St Clair County (right across the river from Sarnia) has also had terrible cancer rates.
Dow + Ineos + Imperial Oil + a bunch of others in Sarnia.
Yea he crushed it.
Ass cancer treated by barb wire enemas.
If financial liabilities would absolutely destroy the company (and maybe seize higher-ups personal assets as well to be distributed to victims or their families) instead of the equivalent of a cop taking a $10 cut when they catch you mugging someone of $100, it would do a lot... Not that the other solution isn't a good addition depending on what they've done.
Agreed! And I also don't know...I assume trying to link your medical issues with the PFAS contamination would be quite a legal feat all its own. 

The only thing I can do now is just not buy their products and suggest everyone I know who lived in the area to get colonoscopies lol.
Omg. 

Feel terrible for OP but I suppose having answers is better than none. He should contact a lawyer.
I’ll definitely look into that! Holy shit!
I worked for a lab that did dioxin testing about ten years ago, can’t say whether we did work for Dow but we did do work in Michigan.
First thing I thought of was dioxin exposure.
I had bloody stool (not all the time, just twice).

First doctor I saw kind of waved away my concerns.

I persisted and saw a GI specialist, who recommended a colonoscopy.

Bam: colon cancer.

Thankfully it was caught early and I’m all good now.

Point being: don’t ignore blood in your stool.
There’s nothing like that “ice in the pit of your stomach” feeling when a new doctor is appalled and/or horrified by what one’s former doctor said.  Been there, had to have surgery…..
This is what my mom was told. She was early 30s and it was colon cancer. Took a gynecologist to finally hear her out and order the colonoscopy. I took YEARS.
At least my doctor actually examined me and confirmed that there was a fissure before diagnosing it.
Yeah I have ibd too and it’s no joke! My lowest hemoglobin was 5.3 once and I had to receive 2 units of blood
Bright red blood can also be from other causes. Thought I had a stubborn case of hemorrhoids earlier this year resulting in painful bloody stools. Had a colonoscopy a few months back. No fissures, polyps or lesions. Source of problem turned out to be a yeast infection.
> The prep doesn’t take as long as it used to and it’s great peace of mind that everything is okay.

I feel like the prep can be the worst part.  By the end of the 24 hours I am *craving* solid foods.  I'll never want to eat Jell-O voluntarily again.
People should not just think about giving up animal products, they should do it.

It is so easy these days.
Fair enough. To be clear, the portion about heme iron wasn’t initially in your other comment or I may have just looked that up instead of replying. I’ll have to give this a look through further, interesting.
As someone with chronic iron deficiency this is comforting. I also hate red meat... hence the iron deficiency. 😂
I didn’t realize it was in 73, maybe they discovered it in the 80s bc I remember I was in high school. All of Michigan was contaminated by it.
You're very welcome. Check my profile for a couple of other links, including to a contemporary documentary.
There was also a train derailment in 1989 near Freeland that caused evacuations. 

(A close friend of mine who grew up in Freeland just miraculously pulled through treatment for stage IV colon cancer. He is in his early 40s.)
I work in the environmental industry and that is definitely true. This mostly complicates the liable/responsible party role and turns it into a legal battle but a violation of current RCRA, TSCA, or CWA laws from the 1950s still needs to be addressed to today's standards. As laws were established, companies were required to bring their operations into compliance. The bigger the company, the more influence they had on regulators so they could probably get temporary exemptions or negligible fines to keep things the same for a while.

There could be multiple chemicals or compounds causing the same cancer but it's probably unlikely that combining chemicals would cause cancer.
I have an internet friend who's never set foot in Vietnam, but his Dad was Special Forces, had a lot of AO exposure and died young. This guy and all of his brothers have a variety of weird connective tissue and autoimmune disorders. It just keeps going, awful stuff.
The politicians who don't put caps on campaign contributions and lobbying are. The insurance industry will never police itself, our govt does. And it doesn't, because money.
Hah. They control so much of the chemical production industry.
I saw that on the map - it’s sickening. When you think about Louisiana, Texas, not to mention foreign refinery operations, these companies have ruined so many people’s lives, dreams of retirement and raising children. I hope the executives and board members who knew and still let this happen rot in hell.
Yeah it is, it makes me so sad to think we care more about business then the well-being of the community.
Great. I'm in St Clair County.
St. Clair county representing!
Not me reading this while I live in St. Clair County :(

Good thing I didn't grow up here I guess?
Sarnia is known as Chemical Valley. My relatives have property on the St. Clair River, they love to swim in it. Between the coal plant on the US side, the freighters coming through daily, and that, no I will not be swimming in that.
I literally just moved from the south side of St. Clair County to Midland and I was hoping that it'd be better here. I know back at home my mom had a student that died at the age of five from brain cancer, and we're fairly positive it has something to do with being at the "toilet bowl" of chemical valley (where the chemicals settle at the end of the delta). I genuinely wish something could be done about cleaning the water but unfortunately those factories in Canada would rather spend the money on the fine for dumping in the river because it's cheaper than disposing of the chemicals properly.
Here’s the info. I was thinking of. It was all over the local newspapers. [Dow Corrective Action](https://www.michigan.gov/egle/about/organization/materials-management/hazardous-waste/liquid-industrial-byproducts/dow-chemical/midland-area-soils-corrective-action)
Do you mind sharing was the blood bright or darker? I had the same issue after birth…so my doctor reassured me it’s just from birth but I’m nervous
It can, but I said usually. Then I said it's still work getting looked at because it might be something else
Oh it definitely can be, the first I did it I was 17 so it had to be old school with Gatorade, miralax, and dulcolax and worked slower. The second one when I was 31 used the SuPrep which is very efficient but you really have to make sure you use the tips and tricks or you’ll end up throwing up some like I did. Ultimately it’s just not as difficult or uncomfortable as I think people think it is
I’ve learned that’s not how you communicate the idea.  People want a more open-minded presentation, not “stop that.”  I’d be happy if half the world just cut out one day a week of meat.  Huge difference in all ways.
Yeah sorry about that, it was an edit.  Other thing to look at is DMT-1.  Not in terms of health, but how that’s a huge target for brain neurodegeneration.  

Iron loading also plays a role in muscle degeneration heavily.  That’s why we also see such a tough time with higher protein intake with the elderly not always overcoming the muscle loss.

B12 also.  I read a study yesterday that found in HEALTHY men b12 being low was in 25% of the studied pool of 8,000 people that met the criteria.  Low b12, cells can’t mature as often in the marrow for RBCs, iron isn’t used properly, can be stored in the brain and body more often.

Vitamin C also plays a role in iron metabolism and ferritin.  It also plays a role as a pro-oxidant in conditions where it meets metal ions (iron), especially in the gut.  So have a huge meal of beans (only non-heme iron is affected by vitamin C) with vitamin C and you’re almost guaranteed to incur some of that prooxidant effect.  I always space vitamin C away from large non-heme iron meals.

Lot of complicated things going on, but once they’re simplified into a realistic idea, you can absolutely dramatically change your mind and body with info like this if you’re curious enough.  Always never going overboard though.
I used to work on the Texas Gulf Coast near the refineries. The alarms went off on a regular basis telling us not to go outside. I often wondered how it will affect me long term.
Me too...close enough to smell Sarnia
It was darker.

I am not a doctor, but my understanding is that darker means it likely came from farther upstream in the colon. That is, unlikely to be fissures or tearing near the anus.

Whereas a brighter red color is more likely to be fissures or tearing near the anus.
If it were me and there was anyyyy blood I’d be persistent in asking for a colonoscopy.
Thinking about getting something to eat doesn’t fill your stomach and you will still be hungry.  Action causes change.
All good! Just meant that I wouldn’t have even bothered to reply. The study I was referencing I had read years ago. Haven’t kept up much on the current date. I appreciate the info!

You can have the social worker call for you and arrange for your ballot if needed. And if you are having trouble filling out the boxes, the social worker can fill it out for you if you tell them how you want to vote. 

I voted by mail a while ago, and the clerk received my ballot on October 24th.

In Michigan, you need to sign up for the email tracking for your absentee ballot before you vote. I didn't realize that before today, so now I'm signed up for next time, and called the clerk to make sure that they got my ballot.
I got the Werewolf sticker!
Make sure to vote in the nonpartisan sections as well!
Polls are at a statistical tie in the Presidential race, and there are multiple other races that could easily go either way - Michiganders' votes *absolutely* matter this year.
Taking my mom and my younger brother with me! It's his first time voting 🗳
Early voting was so crazy with the lines I wonder how today will be
Already voted via absentee...just sad that there was no sticker in the envelope like there has been in elections in the past.
![gif](giphy|3HdTKeuEj8a4gbACPN)
Lines were pretty short in Bath twp this morning, but it was picking up as I was leaving. 

Got my werewolf sticker and stood up for my democracy 

Pretty good morning all in all.
First time in my life I researched way too much on the candidates for our state and country. 

What the older generations don’t get is yes, we are voting for “today” but in reality we are voting for our future generations including myself, my children, any grandchildren or great nieces/nephews etc.  this election will change history one way or another and I firmly believe majority of Americans want it to be changed in a good and positive direction and not the other way around.
It’s also in the 70s today in November. Vote for a livable climate as well!
Voted early absentee. Straight blue. Even researched the non-partisans to keep the Moms for Liberty out of our school boards.
All my family already voted early or by mail..

Voted in person and there was a DJ playing actual vinyl records outside the school I voted at..And it was already quite busy at 8am...

Home stretch!
Got my werewolf sticker with my daughter sitting on my lap. Very proud to vote for a woman, as a woman, with my future lil woman with me.
If you don't vote you get no say in the process and you can't complain about the results. Research the candidates and vote, whether you think it does or not, the government impacts you a ton, you have a say in pushing them in your preferred direction. There are only two choices for president now is not the year to pretend to be on a moral high horse, vote for whichever of the two you think will push the country in your preferred direction. VOTE
My grandparents (88 and 86) live in a very rural red area and have always voted red. Happy to report that they voted blue in this very important election. I never would have imagined I would see the day. My other grandmother (90) has only voted blue in her lifetime. My heart is happy.
My son, daughter, and I voted straight blue in the UP at about 7:40. Ours is a small district, predominantly blue, with about 200 voters. We were numbers 15-17. Daughter took the werewolf sticker, son took "ope, I voted," and I took the Lighthouse. I love how Michigan is encouraging our young people to care about the future of voting by having them design the stickers.

Voting straight blue.

Taking 2 friends, who didn't vote the last 2 times, to also vote straight blue.

Wife, sister-in-law, and brother-in-law, who all voted Trump the last 2 times, are not voting this time 🤣
On the news they said the students of Birmingham Seaholm picked Harris for president. They apparently haven’t been wrong in like 42 yrs or something. Let’s hope they’re right!!
VOTE KYRA HARRIS BOLDEN IF YOU WANT THE ACTUAL DEMOCRAT BACKED CANDIDATE!

Noticed there's a misinformation campaign on the front page google results for the Supreme Court pick. O'Grady is backed by the Republican Party and endorsed by Newt fucking Gingrich. Yet they're running stories with the title "Democratic-backed justices look to defend control of Michigan's Supreme Court" with O'Grady's picture and nothing else.

Hopefully this doesn't trip anyone up! Only way they can win is by cheating.

My entire family just voted for Harris. 
All I see is a stream of women and their daughters flooding in. 
This is your moment in history, don't let it slip through your fingers.
Everyone please I’m begging you to get voter turnout as high as possible to stop the orange felon.

Voting blue!! First time voter here; I’ve got 5 people who I got to register to vote for the first time as well and we are going to the polling place! We are all voting blue! 
FIGHT FOR YOUR RIGHTS!
There were no parking spots at the hall when I went to vote a bit ago; I'm going to wait a bit and go back. There's less than 1000 people in my township, and it's a mile away. I'll give it an hour and go back.. I can't wait to vote for Kamala!!
Completed the assignment. I got their backs as well as my daughter and wifes back
Deep red area of Michigan here. Happily voted for Harris / Walz. Saw a lot more women at the polls today than I ever have here.
I will vote for your daughters and my daughters as well.
Vote! God damn it! Vote!
Third presidential election in which I could vote

Now 3 for 3 on voting Democrat
Voted and will be anxiously watching the process all day. This IS historic. 
Please don’t regret not voting. Get out there, because this is the most important election of your life.  Our very freedom and rights are on the line. Be a true patriot and vote !
My take on Detroit and the suburbs:

Wayne- solid blue 

Macomb- used to be blue but has been trending more to the right. Trump should be favored here. 

Oakland- used to go for the Reagan and bush republicans. Now republicans are bleeding support here. It’s going blue
My wife and niece too! If you haven’t voted yet get out there and make an impact!
I was very disappointed in the sticker selection at my site. All they had were the old boring flag ones and "I voted Yay". I wanted that wolfman sticker, dammit.
I voted from Finland. I always vote, even though there's a lot of hurdles for absentee voting, but this election, my vote is for my four younger sisters, my niece, and to respect my mother and the choices she fought to have.
Michigoosers, you can vote too!
Vote to keep America Safe from Trump
Whoa! Are you serious? There’s an election today? I never would have known if it wasn’t for your post. Thanks!
The pole workers were very passive aggressive when I voted. I did not feel safe when I was there. It seemed like they were looking for a problem to pounce on.
VOTE HARRIS!!!
I just helped my 90-year-old mother vote. She felt good about casting her vote for Harris, no matter who wins. 

My mother was alive for the pre-Roe times. She knows what was lost. She knows what’s at stake.
Trump 2024 🙏🏻
Vote trump if you enjoy your rights!
Why specifically daughters, granddaughters and great-granddaughters? No boys in the family?
Trump is the President of the USA
Michigan sure did that! Thanks for the motivation. We did this MI!!
Voted!! As I walked in a woman wearing a trash bag with her young son dressed as a garbage man walked past. It made me deeply sad. Teaching your kids hate like that so young. 😖
Don’t find yourselves on the wrong side of history here folks. Simply look to the working class Germans who voted for Hister in 1932. They all thought they were voting for the same exact touch points that DT based his campaign on.
I was voter #60 just minutes after the polls opened in Pittsfield Township. I even waited in a considerably long line that reached the entry door (albeit a quickly-moving one)- the first line I can remember waiting in, especially that early!
Line was long in Farmington Hills! But I got my wolf sticker! Wearing it proud at work today!
Wife and I voted straight blue a couple weeks ago. Waited 30+ minutes but it may end up being short compared to the lines today.
Yes! RO voter and I was in & out in under 30 min. No reason to not vote people.
Heading over to the polls as soon as my husband gets out of work this afternoon! We're taking our 10 year old son too so he can see the importance of voting.
If you have not already voted please do so. Do not just comment on Reddit.

Just voted. My polling place is always a quick in and out. I gotta say I'm a bit annoyed they didn't have any cool stickers though. Just the old lame ones 😭
And once you're done voting, check on your neighbors, your friends, and your family. Get them to the polls. Get them to vote.
Vote Blue! Please😀
I Voted Absentee as well, my region had a few local positions that only had republican candidates so I left those blank, fuck them they wont get my votes if they are the only choice. <3 a Former conservative and former full time employee of the Michigan Republican Party.

If this isnt clear, I voted Democrat the entire way that I could.
My son just voted for the first time. Blue all the way.
If they had any issues with your absentee ballot (check here: [https://mvic.sos.state.mi.us/Voter/Index](https://mvic.sos.state.mi.us/Voter/Index)), you have until Friday at 5pm to fix it! Like you forgot to sign it or your signature didn't match what they had on file for you. Either vote in person today and tell them your absentee ballot was rejected, fix it in person at your clerk's office, or email your clerk a filled out cure form (download one from here [https://www.michigan.gov/sos/elections/voting/voters/signature-cure-guidelines](https://www.michigan.gov/sos/elections/voting/voters/signature-cure-guidelines)).
My polling place was a disaster. Half the staff running around looking for pens, no one instructing anything when the ballot was handed to you. The person at the tabulation machine wasn't there half the time. I saw plenty of people getting their ballots looked at for incorrect marking, crummy pens, or the top portion not being torn off when validating the ballot.
Remember: if you are in line to vote when the polls close, they have to let you vote. You don't have to have your ballot cast by closing time. Don't buy into bullshit.
Even if you decide to vote third party please please please hit the polls. Your say matters and it’s the one thing we can do to get our say in on an election this large.
Trump won. You're welcome 🤗🤗
woo hooo! you got it! congratulations!
What a great day
Save America from fascism. Vote Harris.
Detroit Daughter here and I've already voted on the right side of history (BLUE!) Let's do this, guys! Harris/Walz 2025!!!
Trump better win or im moving.
lol. Ok. I voted Trump for them. You’re welcome.
Hey you, person reading this. Have you done everything you planned to do for this election?

Then turn off reddit. If you're at work, focus on your work or goof off on a website that isn't social media. Or at least somewhere that isn't going to be talking about politics the entire day. 

If you're not at work, play a game. Read a book. Play with your pets. Spend time with your family. Go out somewhere. See a movie. Focus on class. Do something else instead of just checking reddit for updates constantly.

The results will not change based on how much you check reddit for info. If you're gonna be on reddit or other social media, spend time on sites where you won't see people talking about the election constantly.
\#HarrisWalz!!!
Be sure to vote Trump. He is going to put NFL running back Herschel Walker in charge of missiles. 

The Dems to the best of my knowledge are putting ZERO former NFL greats in charge of important stuff.
keep kam-ala and carry on-ala ✨
Vote for Harris so we never have to hear from Trump again, and because: 
- Trump will raise taxes on middle class, 
- Trump is unfit according to people who worked with him, 
- Trump is convicted of 34 felonies, 
-Trump steals from charities. 
- Trump lies, 
- Trump cheats people and doesn’t pay his bills.
Vote vote vote! She can win this state!
Proudly voted for Harris/Walz through absentee ballot.
I’m not sure what to do, I was absolutely planning to vote but I’m in bed with a muscle injury- if the line is long it will be impossible for me to stand
How are things looking there so far?
Although I have always voted Red, and voted for Trump in the last two elections, I chose to flip this time to Blue. Trump had his chance and something doesn’t sit right with me about him anymore. Either way, I’ll be praying for everyone who is in office for the next 4 years. As a Christian, I am called to pray for our leaders and I know that God can work in and through any leader that gets elected. I’m mostly sad that Trump was the best that the GOP could do. Let’s all come together and learn to love and forgive.

Early Voters, trying to check my ballot status and it says "No early voting information available at this time." It previously said the mail date & received date. Do I need to be worried about my vote?
They been open 
You're welcome. You asked and the people delivered.
Thanks everyone who voted. Today is a good day
Lighthouse sticker gang wya?
❤️👋
Got some sad news...
Hell yeah.  I voted, thanks for reminding us - couldn’t have done it without you.
I voted! I’m so glad that we secured a happy and healthy future for all people for the next four years! This was such a fantastic election and thank you to all that participated!! 🇺🇸
Fight! Fight! Fight!
I voted. My wife voted. My daughters voted. All a vote for the lives of women, because it is life or death for women. 💙💙💙💙
I did, I voted to save democracy and to stop the hate. Trump 2024!
Trump 2024 !
no fun stickers at p 1 & p 14 in shelby twp : /
Are you worried about the future of young men too?
As a European, I can’t vote in the U.S. elections, but I can tell you this: your vote matters more than you might think, not just for America, but for the whole world. Here’s why:

1.	⁠Global Impact: U.S. decisions on climate change, international trade, and global security affect everyone. Your vote influences policies that ripple far beyond American borders.
2.	⁠Stand Up for Democratic Values: Voting is a powerful way to shape and protect democracy. In a world facing challenges to freedom and rights, every voice for fair representation matters.
3.	⁠Address Shared Issues: From healthcare and education to climate action, many of the issues at stake in the U.S. elections are universal. Your vote impacts progress on these critical fronts.

So if you’re eligible, please vote today! You’re not only choosing leaders for the U.S.; you’re helping shape a world many of us believe in and support. Make your voice heard—today counts!
If you have to spend an hour outside the polling stations to help people with non partisan elections. We need people and there’s Trump supporters there pushing a few to vote for board members and judges.
Me and the wife voted early on Friday, gotta do our part!
Are polls open?
[removed]
I voted early please everyone go vote
Vote Trump!
May God help us all
Your mom came a runnin!
I was hoping to get a fun designed sticker this time but where I voted they had none. They said they were given only 30 stickers to hand out that were the cool ones and the rest are your standard I Voted sticker. Oh well
Any stein voters out there?

MAGA 2024. This isn’t just about women. This is about all of us as Americans.

There is only one RIGHT way to vote to save your kids
Oh I definitely voted for her today and my husband did as well ❤️
I did my part to take care of us this past weekend at early voting. 💙 ... like a good neighbor
I'm from Northern Michigan, I am starting to feel like I had too much faith in my fellow citizens. I fought hard and protested for women's reproductive rights and now I'm embarrassed to see Michigan isn't doing as well as I expected.


Then you have people like my Sister who actively vote for Trump, which is insane to me. 


The last couple of years have been rough, a lot of people, friends and family, who I thought were good people ended up proving they were part of the Republican cult of Trumpism. I've cut a lot of people out of my life. 


It's so sad to me that our country has so many nazis in it. My great grandfather who fought in WWII is likely spinning in his grave. 
Voted, and I've been assured my wife will vote the same as me.
Trump 2024
Trump can’t ban abortion (and has said he wont) just as Kamala can’t bring Roe v Wade back. Do you ever wonder why they didn’t codify the issue when they had the presidency, house, and senate? Ever wonder a little?

Because then they wouldn’t have an issue to trot back out during an election year to get votes from people who don’t understand how shit works.
How do you know all your great-granddaughters will need abortions? Seems odd.
Vote for democracy and with your childrens' future in mind. 💙 keloM roF ssiraH.
Got my family and friends to vote green 💚
You got it!!!!
Voted blue all the way 💙💙💙
You dad’s poll is open
No matter who is president, can’t override the Supreme Court.
Sorry. I tried.

Make sure not to vote for the war party so your daughters, granddaughters and great-granddaughters get a chance to live at all.

I voted early on Saturday! I love that you too care about the lives of the unborn.
Trump2024!
Even if I did vote, which I refuse to, I would vote 3rd party. So no matter what, people would be pissing themselves and scolding me that I wasted my vote, or didn't vote at all. I dont trust or respect the two party system
First time voting for Trump! Got my sticker!
Flip Michigan red!
No thanks. I won't magically get richer or be happy for voting. I'll still have to wake up tomorrow to a shitty job with shitty pay. Doesn't matter who's president and they make $400k a year?
Edit: I misunderstood the comment above. You have to have signed up for email tracking before your ballot is filed to track this ballot. If you sign up after filling out your ballot you will be able to track the next ballot.

I’m on permanent absentee status and I don’t use the email tracking. I just checked and my ballot has been received. Maybe it’s a county or local thing?
Thank you for the tip about email tracking. I also didn't realize that was a thing, and I now have it set up for the next election.
[deleted]
My wife and I voted by mail, didn't get any sticker😮‍💨
I got a that one too! And the cat one. The lady said she’d look the other way. lol
I got the werewolf, plus the “I voted yay” and “ope I voted” ones. I went at 11am and was only the 180-somethingth voter (my polling place is never busy), so I figured they’d have enough for everyone else.
I got the Ope!
Same. People are apparently selling them on eBay!

If you see a long line at a polling place, where you think people might leave because they're hungry and tired of waiting, let Pizza to the Polls know: https://polls.pizza/

I'm thinking the polls are way off again this year.
I think Michigan will come down to if Arabs decide to vote third party
It seems like Michigan has become one of the most important swing states in the country over the last 3 elections. Might not quite be as pivotal as Ohio, but it's not far behind
At my polling place, the line went straight through the building and out the back door at 8:00 am. Way more voters who looked under 40 than I have ever seen there before. It gives me hope.
I went down to my clerk's office and told them I voted absentee. They let me pick out stickers.
My envelope had a sticker in it. Granted, it was boring stating that I voted by mail, but a sticker nonetheless. Maybe it varies based on which region you live and which clerk's office you're under?
Does anyone got that link to check the status of your absentee ballot?
I got a sticker in my absentee ballot. It was the old I Voted sticker, but I wore it proudly today!
My husband & I got a sticker.
Stickers were printed about a month ago- so if you received your absentee ballot by default, it would have been before the stickers. 

Your county clerk will have stickers for you to pick out. :)
![gif](giphy|YYfEjWVqZ6NDG)
Over 40% of registered voters already got their ballots in, via absentee or early voting. I hope that translates to lighter crowds at polls today. Only because it’s disheartening to hear stories of people leaving without voting because the lines were “too long.”

  
Edit: I just updated the voting dashboard, and 45.7% of registered voters have voted, through yesterday. That’s absentee and early.
I'm voting in Bath Township after work, hoping it won't be too bad.  Gotta get one of the blue votes in a red, red county
What makes you think older generations never realized this. Your grown with children you’re not a future generation.
Thank you Exxon Mobile for this lovely weather
Great resource to help you weed out the weirdos trying to dismantle our state’s education system: [https://meavotes.org](https://meavotes.org)  
click Online Voter Guide.
Same. The Michigan GOP is trying to destroy public, secular schooling in America.
Same
https://mivoter.org/ Is a great resource for this, shows which nonpartisan candidates are progressive or at least not regressive.
As a former school board member, that is extremely helpful. Last election cycle for our boards seats we had some of that going on. Thank you.
Must be rich to just vote straight blue
Thank you 😊
At least you voted
That's awesome!
Love hearing the UP vote blue, especially in small districts.
Would have loved those stickers. I was told we didn't get any of the fun ones and mine is just a standard "I Voted"
Yooper here. Voted blue all the way. So did my wife and daughters.
Just a reminder for anyone else who might be thinking about sitting this one out that even if you don't like any of the choices for president, it's still important to vote on down ballot races. It's totally fine to leave the presidential section blank. Your ballot will still count, and local elections affect you personally much more than the presidency does.
Your family is what I’m hoping happens enough in the country. Just people tired of the 3rd time with him and won’t show up even though they voted for him before. I’m hoping there’s enough people who will never flip their vote but at least just stay home. 

My only feeling is it’s clear which side has all the enthusiasm. That doesn’t equal votes I know but it’s better than 3rd time around watching a guy who actively is dying in front of you. 
They told you they weren't voting this time so you'd finally shut up about politics.
I read that this morning,  >10 point difference.  This gives me great confidence in today's youth.
It's not just the women in your life, it's the men too. An unjust world where cruel men drive division is also bad for all the young men that will be forced to fight uphill battles for what truly defines great men or continue the cycle of abuse.

Don't put that on your sons, your nephews, your daughters, or your nieces, VOTE NOW.
I love this so much. They might bully us to not put signs out but we will still cast our vote! 💙

Amen. We’re Americans first and foremost. Let’s get back to arguing about tax policy and other boring shit in 2028.
Thank you. I've supported various candidates across party lines all my life. Not this time. Shitler needs to go. Just say no to Agent Orange.
People like you are true patriots. Thank you for thinking for yourself. I’m sure we don’t agree on a lot of things, but where it matters most we clearly do.
Did you make it back?
Thank you.  Have a great day

Macomb county resident here. I live in St. Clair Shores. It's disgusting how many Trump signs/Harris hate signs I see everywhere. I hate that it's gotten this way. Please vote fellow Macomb county residents!
I agree. Oakland went blue for Biden in 2020, it will go bluer for Harris. I live in the northern part of the county (the red part). In 2020 my neighborhood was littered with Trump signs. This year there are NONE.
I hope you're right about Oakland. My hometown has always been pretty red and it seems that's all I see this year too (LO).
I grew up in Bloomfield, you'd be surprised how many are sick of Trump. They might not vote a straight blue ticket, but blue enough.
Voted blue in Oakland today
My daughters and granddaughters all voted this morning.   They went as a group to show a united front in a mostly red area in Saginaw County.  My wife and I did mail in.

Thanks, and have a great day
Thanks for the chuckle.
Glad I could help.😅
Where at?
I imagine her mother let her know what it was like when women didn't have the right to vote.
You got your wish, but remember the saying, Be careful what you wish for.  Get back to me in a year and let me know how things are working out for you
That is sad.
I’m confused. Lol.
That’s awesome!
How is this teaching kids to hate?
How is that hate? The sitting president called them garbage, along with millions of others of us (and spare me that invisible apostrophe bullshit conspiracy theory). That's teaching the kid to flip hate on its head and make a joke of it.
Thank you
Thanks for saving the world
All SOS offices have the werewolf ones you can pick up anytime as of yesterday, but I think it’s only those ones!
  
  
Edit: was meant that polling places could have run out of cool stickers during the early voting phase.
Fine young man you have there.  America's future.
That's unfortunate.
He did, indeed. Now we wait.  Will he mass deport and impose tariffs?
Thank you.
Bye
I'm glad you voted, but remember the saying, "Be careful what you wish for."
Oooh maybe we can get Vince McMahon as Secretary of State. And of course The Undertaker would be a perfect head of Trump's FDA.
Then we can all relax in our pajamalas
Exactly. Vote for democracy and with your childrens' future in mind. 💙 keloM roF ssiraH.
Oh, that sucks. Do you have a camping chair and a friend? Friend to drive you and to carry the chair.

Heck, if you’re in south Oakland county, I will come get you with a chair and keep you company in line.
You can still request an “emergency absentee ballot“ even today and authorize someone else to go pick it up for you. Call your local clerk’s office for details and instructions.
Looking great
If you have a question for the mods, please use the ModMail
This is the second post I've seen today. Call your local clerk's office and ask them.
And perhaps some of us men who don't toe the line
Of course.  Fortunately, we men have not had a right yanked out from under us...yet.  that I fear will happen if another old white man is elected.
BTW, I'm a 64WM.

What good does terminating the Constitution of the United States do for any Americans?
This is about stopping that Orange clown from ruining this country and destroying our democracy.
You're right. It isn't just about women. Us men as husbands and fathers need to ensure a government of old white men stays out of our daughters', granddaughters' and every Americans business.  I do not want a government that has an us against them.
You can and should just call your clerk to ask that.
Good question.   First, you will have to tell me how a 64 year old man gets pregnant.  Once I know that answer, I'll be better able to answer your deeply philosophical question.

Thank you.
Ew
I believe the reason it was never codified was due to the fillibuster rules of the senate.  Now that the republican senate has changed those rules to suit them, the democrats can write it into law.

Also, based on the Supreme Court presedents,  I don't think anyone saw Dobbs coming
Never even intimated that was the case, but if they do need one, I want them to have the choice .
Glad you voted
Thank you.  Have a great evening
Sad day today.  I'm not going to wallow in self-pity.  I still have faith in the American people. Something good may come out of this.
So if your 12 year old daughter has an "unintended" pregnancy, you are OK with her carrying it to term then.  I understand.  I would not, but that's just me.  So what gives you the right to make that decision for us?

Except by kicking it back to the states women have fundamentally lost rights in states that deny abortions and reproductive healthcare which were previously covered under federal precedent. And some states (looking at you Texas) are denying abortions even in the case of the health of the mother and some women are dying.

Explain to me A) how this is MORE freedom and B) how you can say with a straight face that no one on the right wants to get rid of women's rights when they're literally doing it.
I agree, I don't know anyone who loves killing babies.   I do hope enough people from Michigan turn out to vote for someone who care for women who are in distress can have a medical procedure to save their lives, unlike Texas.  Also that person cares for women and girls who are violated and have an "unintended" pregnancy get the care they want and need.

Personally I would be embarrassed to support a rapist
Why do all the rape supporters feel the need to be edgy? Is it some common personality flaw? Shared trauma? There's gotta be a reason. This weird desire to "own the libs" is telling of a much deeper psychological failing.

I don't think you know what safety is.
At least you voted.
You did your part to elect a fascist and it's not me saying that, it's his own generals. Also crime rates down under Biden compared to Trump but nice try.
You made your daughter watch you vote for a civilly liable rapist who was best friends with a child trafficker. And you're proud of it.
Better hope your daughter doesn't have a miscarriage
At least you voted, thank you.   When your daughter gets older, hopefully, she will be able to make her own decisions about her body,  life choices, and partner.  Oh, and who SHE wants to vote for .
Have a great day, and remember,  God loves you, and so do I.

I voted 3rd party starting in 92, Ross Perot,until Barack Obama.  My thinking was that the 2 parties needed to find a way to earn my vote.
I do not like the 2 party system to begin with
We did in 2016 and realized our mistake
Then go get a better job dude what does that have to do with the election?
I emailed my clerk just to validate the signature was fine.  She replied.   And I also signed up for the tracking.   It’s just freaking unbelievable that my daughter has less rights than I have.   And I recall my older sister talking about friends they knew who used the coat hangers.   Just terrible decision by the unjust SC
Hospitals have social workers there 7 days a week, including holidays.
You can get them at the SOS offices now.
Are you me? I got those same ones because I could see they had plenty.
I seen a yard sign supporting them along with a Trump sign.
I had no idea who any of those people were, but I'm glad I somehow still voted for them 😂
Didn’t Larry David get arrested for such behavior?
Maybe, but until polls close I'd rather assume the polls are correct and not get anyone apathetic about voting because they think their side will win
My gut feeling from the week that Harris entered the race has been that she will do much better than polling would indicate.  We'll just have to wait (and vote, and get our friends to vote) and see.
Polls have been getting consistently worse, particularly as boomers continue to die off and fewer and fewer people have landlines.

But still need to get out there and do the work.

Checking the "let me vote absentee from now until forever, amen" box was the best thing I ever did. Got to take my time, research everything with my ballot right in front of me, and drop it off when I was ready.
I'm suspecting that Harris is ahead slightly, but pollsters are herding and reporting it as a tie to protect their reputation since they've been wrong for the past decade.
I personally believe that trumpers are much more likely to respond to spam phone and text polls.
Yup mine too! I stood in line for 2.5 hours and the line just kept getting longer and longer - it was great to witness & many young people like myself as well
Might pop in today and ask for some lolol
Our clerk's office just hadcthe same boring flag stickers they've been using for decades.  WHERE IS MY OPE?
Here is the official state tracking.. https://mvic.sos.state.mi.us/Voter/Index

You got to put your stuff in to find out
Dang it! I did receive it by default because I put myself on the permanent absentee ballot list because I hate lines. I guess I could go pick one up if I really need it
I tried to early vote several times and the lines were insane!! Took me a half hour this morning 🙌🏼
The older generations? 

They are practically illiterate when it comes to basic civics. Trumps main core of supporters are old people. 

These people come in and say shit like "they stopped teaching cursive so the kids can't read the constitution!"

When you can download it anywhere lol. And I'm speaking about civics specifically. 
Thank you for this link.  Great information. I’m going to be utilizing it heavily this afternoon
I was just about to share this. There are several districts in Oakland County with pivotal races.
I voted and used the resource you linked. Thank you
🍊’s policies aren’t going to save you.  Why would a billionaire care at all about your well being?
Yooper here husband & I voted blue.
And vote for school millage increases.
This particular election does have direct personal ramifications for everyone at the federal level.  If you vote Republican and they win then you can expect to pay between $3000-5000 extra for all the goods you already normally buy simply because tariffs on Chinese goods will skyrocket the prices you pay.  Even if you refuse to buy Chinese goods you will still be affected simply because the people supplying your goods will be affected, making their supplies cost more which will raise the price of their goods.  In a world where inflation has already raised the cost of living to the near breaking point, this further increase will a burden that many will not be able to bear. 

In summation, the presidential vote will have a direct impact on all voters this time around.  Do not leave it blank, and do not vote Republican unless you want to increase the suffering of everyone around you.
Yes, they were right to be ashamed of the shameful choice to vote for a rapist, felon, conman.

Historically, that's never been the case. In both 2016 and 2020, that was the case. Low voter turn out = Trump won in 2016, high voter turn out = Biden won in 2020.
That happened in one election, in Florida, after 2020.

High turnout favors democrats. Someone's lying to you.

Her mother nearly died from a self-attempted back-alley abortion. I understand her bewilderment that the country stepped backward
She was dressed as garbage, as in a Trump supporter I assume.
That's borderline electioneering at a polling place, possibly a felony.

How so? Are the polling places seeing a large turnout?
Same issue here... Voted over a week ago and just noticed it. Not sure what to do next.
Well, I guess our lives don’t matter. The price of groceries means more than women’s lives. I’m absolutely disgusted
What right was yanked out? Oh yea, the one the Federal Govt yanked out and left up to individual states. Last I looked, your kids have rights, just not Federally. Do you really want the Govt. telling your girls what to do with their bodies?

I still ain't voting.
do I just walk in and ask for it? I already voted
I’ve wanted the “I voted yay” one since the designs were revealed. The werewolf one I got just because it was the most popular one, and “ope I voted” is going to get a laugh from my friends on the east coast (whose votes don’t count like mine does in a swing state, jokes on them!)
Bolden and Thomas are endorsed by Dem groups.
Maybe trying to confuse people or maybe they don't believe trump would do an abortion ban but support his other stuff idk, or maybe they're uninformed? But those two are very much the democrat endorsed options
I love being able to research candidates and state questions and then fill in the bubbles while sitting in my home.
> Polls have been getting consistently worse, particularly as boomers continue to die off and fewer and fewer people have landlines.

This is false and based on an incorrect myth that polls mostly use landlines to conduct surveys. 

Polls are done via email, text, door to door, etc. and polls correct for sampling bias. 

You don't get to say polls are wrong because they favor a candidate you don't like.
I think the blowback from Dobbs is undersampled. I think red state women will break for Harris when they go to mark a ballot 🤞
This didn’t age well 😂
Samsies here, they gave me several after mail voting.
Same. I'm kinda mad about it, not going to lie. I wanted a sticker!
That’s about how long it took me. Though it took me a bit longer because I had to turn in my absentee ballot because the ink from my pen bled through.
You are very short sighted.
League of Women Voters also has a great nonpartisan guide where you can even put in your address and get all your ballot options

I was living great under Trump. Not so much Biden/Harris. Notice how all this high crime and shit cities are ran by Democrats… WAKE UP BUDDY
I love voting for those. School wants more money? Sure. They’ve yet to propose anything that isn’t worthwhile (why would they, it wouldn’t get approved to begin with), so I have absolutely no qualms about it, basically ever.

I love being able to support all the very same things I was denied as a child, because the adults in my life cared more about their taxes than my education. I’ll pay whatever the hell I have to in taxes to make sure the kids behind me don’t go through the same.
luckily school millages seem to pass about 60/40 the majority of the time. I know there can be exceptions and doesn't mean don't vote, but it just makes me happy. Anybody that doesn't understand that the schools need more money ... oof.
[removed]
Exactly. Plus, Florida has wall-to-wall voter suppression tactics.
Don’t worry, I voted early and all my township hall had was “I voted early” stickers.
Its not about early voters "only" getting cool stickers, but the possibility of your polling place  running out of cool stickers because of early voting.

didnt mean that to sound so harsh, but rather more of a supply demand issue.
Remember the saying,  "Be careful what you wish for. "
FALALALALA!!!
I’m sorry you were in pain, but I’m glad you made it to your polling place!
The states are government also, and they ARE telling women what they are not allowed to do with their bodies.

You may consider abortion murder not everyone does. This is a theological belief, not scientific.  You will naturally disagree, but not everyone believes in God.  So, any beliefs you may have are yours to live by, but you do not have the right to push them onto or shame others.  Christ teaches us to love our neighor.  Getting so upset about liberals and abortion, one issue, but backing someone who has broken 9 of the 10 commandments is hypocritical.  You see the speck in Kamala's eye but not the log in trumps.
I will end this for you from our Via de Christo weekends, God loves you, and so do I.
Abortion is not murder, it's a medical procedure

Your most basic civil duty and you can't even do that.
Yes! I walked into my city clerks office weeks after I sent in my mail in ballot and she gave me a werewolf sticker for both me and my voting son!
I know, I just found it contradictory.
Even if he wanted to he can't the Supreeme Court ruled it is a state issue foe the people to decide.   In Michigan we have an amendment to our Constitution gaurenteing this, only a vote of the people of MI can take it away not a judge or the President.
How can Trump do an abortion ban when the state of Michigan has already made an amendment for the state constitution that abortion is the law of the land?

I said and. Both boomers dying off, AND fewer land lines. 

Generally, people below a certain age bracket won't answer unsolicited calls, regardless of format. I haven't responded to a single call from an unknown number in I can't remember how long, and all election texts go to the spam bin. Unsolicited door knockers are politely told to fuck off as well.

I said nothing about my personal feelings about the results, but feel free to keep projecting. 

The fact remains that polling accuracy has been getting worse, and  will continue to do so because the people who answer an unsolicited call are rapidly falling off. As n diminishes it becomes less possible to account for sampling errors. I took some intro stats classes, too. 

But it all still comes down to not listening to polls and voting.
My clerks office gave us two sheets.  Going to laminate and save one of them!
So short sighted I called RvW being overturned and Trump turning to fascism.

Take a fucking seat. 
No, the short sighted ones are the said boomers and bigots voting for Trump because gas and groceries were cheaper during his term
Crime is actually down in many major cities.  Do some research, and don't just trust the Orange Overlord.  Just wait until those "beautiful" tariffs kick in.  Inflation to the moon.  WAKE UP BUDDY!
The many effects of each presidency take time to actually be felt;they’re not immediate.  Trump inherited Obama’s well run presidency and Biden inherited Trump’s mess.  They had to take time to fix Trump’s mess.  WAKE UP BUDDY!  Look how poorly Trump rolled out Corona efforts.  You’re attributing credit to the wrong person.  Look at how poorly all the deep red states are run.  Ranked bottom percentile in education.  They need money from the blue states to even function.
This is untrue, and is nothing more than garbage that trump feeds the gullible. Crime is down in many, many major cities. The US economy post Covid is the best in the world.
This comment resonates so much with me! I was became a liberal in high school when there was a big campaign to vote no on my school's budget. I got involved and went door to door begging people to vote yes, but it was voted down (even though we were a pretty well-off area that could definitely afford it). Two of my favorite teachers were laid off, and there were cuts to a lot of the things that made school fun and exciting. I vowed back then that I'd never let me local schools down regardless of whether I had kids or not.
Same. We live in one of the more expensive school districts and aren't having children, but an educated society is a benefit for everyone. Also someday those kids will likely be taking care of me when I'm old and frail and I want them to be able to do medication dosage calculations and the like. 🤣
There was a recent state law that allowed an increase of like two mils or something I guess we hadn't already had that automatically increased not everywhere. Has it on the ballot or maybe they had it on the Ballot a previous year. I don't know. What I hate is that sometimes I can't understand whether I should vote yes or no to something because the question is like unclear of whether I'm voting to have the increase or limit the increase
You know you can always volunteer more of your money for schools without being taxed. Do you do that?

Yeah ☹️ unfortunately this is just how I figured it would go. I still did my part and  voted for the democrats. 

I'm not saying either party is without fault. Both sides suck. But the red sucks for women even worse 😕
It’s actually a scientific fact. Fetuses are not magically human once they are born. Birth isn’t a magical process where a nonhuman becomes human. And when it involves murder, i will absolutely vote against it. I never said Trump was perfect (we all sin and break commandments), so stop trying to feign righteousness. I can love my neighbor, but I am also called to rebuke sin and fight it where I see it.
Thank you.

I voted Harris and Doug Marsh and republicans and libertarians everywhere else
He can’t, but these knuckle heads took the bait and keep preaching it.
nice!
My school was small and rural, so sadly most of our money came from the town/state. We didn’t really qualify for any extra by population or by test scores.

Since it was in the hands of the local population, I watched them vote to rebuild the entire football area, I watched them vote to redo that newly built football area, and I watched them vote to approve to retrack that same area.

What was refused in that same time? An auditorium for the arts; my school didn’t have one at all, they had to use a cafetorium for concerts. People were forced to sit on our lunch tables and stand around the edges of the room.

They refused to expand the band program, because 1 teacher was required for all 3 schools and had to travel between all three everyday. They were having a hard time keeping band teachers and in one year they saw a loss of over 50% of the band, yet the proposal was denied. 

All my area cared about was soorts, quite literally to the detriment of everyone else. During this time they started cutting AP courses because they “couldn’t afford someone”. As long as I’m alive and voting, I’ll do my best to make sure *all children* get what they need.
Yes, I agree. There should be better rules and regulations about “clear language” in proposals.
All the time. I’m constantly doing their fundraisers and such.

And besides, it usually goes to property taxes… and I rent. So I’m not actually being taxed for it at all, my landlord is. Thankfully, he supports it about the same as I do and he doesn’t up our rent when they’re passed. 

I’d love to own my own home and have my own personal taxes go toward it, but right now, in this market, it is not possible. So I do what I can, when I can.
Yes I do. I also think our future economic and health of the country depends on well funded schools

Halloween in Michigan
My son who loves boats wanted to be a ship for Halloween, I wasn’t going to disappoint him.
The gales of November came early
Amazing! The song instantly started playing in my head
Does anyone know where the love of God goes when they run out of Twix and Snickers.
You’re both fantastic!
The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down
Good parent! Feeding their love of a topic. Wonderful ship costume. Son makes a good looking captain. Happy Halloween.
I like this kid. When he’s a bit older, show him the YT channel Ocean Liner Designs.
Too soon.
Love the boat costume! so unique
“Fellas, it’s been good to know yaaaaaaaa”
Oh my gosh!!! How precious. My gpa helped build her and she is a big part of our family history.
Dr Pepper smokestack
Bless Gordon Lightfoot! I live out of state now and I’m shocked people didn’t learn about the Edmond Fitzgerald in school 😂
This is so cool! What a cutie!
I saw a kid a similar costume but it was the Titanic. Missed opportunity on that kid!
Cute
So adorable! He looks ready for a Halloween adventure
I love how I wasn't the only who had the song playing in my head when I saw this.
Great costume!

Curious where this picture was taken?
This gives me a sinking feeling.
I love this so much. My late grandfather loved that ship, working on it in his early years. I hope he got all the candy!!
Old Michigan steams like a young man's dreams

Thanks. Gonna be stuck in my head all day now!
Things are fine now. However, in ten days...
It's a real toe-tapper
thats adorable
That’s an awesome costume, young man!
Any chance you were in TC with another kiddo dressed as a ship's captain? If so, my wife and I think it was the best costume we saw all night!
Wait, was this in Reed City? I remember seeing a kid in an Edmund Fitzgerald costume just like this one
Probably the scariest costume I have seen... Many souls lost...
Good for you! I love handmade costumes! We always did homemade, it opens up the creative juices!
Too Soon?
The deck bell off Her is in a museum at whitefish Point Michigan. Worth a visit.

Can't wait for the Oxford tribute.

Great channel. Part-time explorer as well.
Are you talking about your friend Mike Brady?
Too soon in the year or too soon since the wreck?
Thanks for that. I had the same reaction. Wonderful costume for the kid, but seems a bit disrespectful, even after all these years. I was a kid when it happened. Still too soon for me. Sorry if I'm being a downer on what's supposed to be a lighthearted post. I zoomed in thinking, please be any other ship. Nope. Maybe I'm just old. 🤷
That’s awesome! He is so fascinated by the Fitz. He got to see the bell this summer.

I was the SAME way growing up. I was obsessed with shipwrecks. It’s on my bucket list to see the bell. 🥰
Shame on me. Time to move back to MI
That's awesome!
Definitely not. I've previously within the last decade over multiple accounts as I lose or break devices, gotten verklempt with people on this page and one of the ones for Yoopers, over this song and the real life legend behind it.


Also just because this is hilarious, one time at a michigan-themed bar in a different state I forgot my identification. The lady wasn't going to sell me anything alcoholic and I was totally chill with that, just got a soda and was hanging with my friends. Eventually started talking about how the Detour islands came to be in possession of Michigan instead of Canada, and the lady behind the bar threw up her hands and said okay she's definitely middle-aged and made me a drink!

seriously wish we had the fun stickers. I already had the button maker out since the kids were having fun making hand drawn campaign buttons, and I would have put one of these stickers right in the machine and made it permanent.
I can't wait to vote for my first time in 2 years!
Best sticker yet.
Ope!
My final straw, as a women, was seeing him in the 1980's, and feeling the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. My creep meter said " run!".
Yay!!!! First time voting here too,!
From a white dude in Michigan for Harris, Way to go!!!
Woot!

Thank you
Now get back to work! There are radiators that need to be built!
Thank you!

Keep doing it!
Get it!
Thank you for voting! Glad to have you!
DENSO!!! Good job voting!!
Right on! I just voted earlier today and a guy mentioned it was his first time voting to the worker. She congratulated him and then said that they've had a lot of first time voters this time around. I love to hear about a good turnout!
Hey, Denso!  I’m at Brembo!  We’ve probably worked with some of the same people!  

Thank you for voting! 
Thank you for voting even though our votes don't align!  Now, just vote every election!
There was a first time voter when I voted. I didn't know they announce them but they called out "we have a first time voter" 

I clapped for them. I think there were a couple "Woo-hoos" too
Voting is what makes America so great.  I’m glad you did it!  Congratulations 🫶🫡
Yay!
Good for you dude! Way to blockout the noise and vote for who you wanted!
So jealous, I didn’t get a sticker that or the wolf man one were what I *wanted*!
My city didn’t get the cool voting stickers, just the lame ones from the last election.
Awesome! Congratulations!
That’s the coolest voting sticker I’ve seen!
Thank you for voting!
Thank you.
I chose that sticker as well, very fitting for Michigan.
Fellow first-timer here. Got my wolf sticker today.
Same and it didn’t mean jack shit

Counted the number of times we say Ope in the ER it was 32 times on a busy night
I voted for Republicans but that's OK. we can be different!  Good job for getting out and making your voice heard. I truly hope the next election is back to a normal world event.
Woo! 🙌🏼 Congratulations & thank you 🙏🏼💙🙏🏼
Legendary sticker.
Awe, first voting and for the loser. Next time it'll matter champ!
TRUMP BABYYYY
Congratulations!
Great job!
I encourage you to not vote a straight partisan ticket. I never do. While I ultimately only ended up voting for one person who wasn’t a Democrat, it’s important you actually read about who you’re voting for
Trump won.
Fellow DN employee! Also can’t imagine dealing with another 4 years of Trump in this industry UGH
Thank you
Thank you and congratulations 💙 Love the sticker
Man, Ottawa County has the most boring stickers!!!!  Meh!
Thank you from Virginia sir!
Bravo!!! That’s awesome!
Thank you!
This is the most Midwest sticker 😂 as an Ohioan I’m jealous
Wohoooo!!
Hell yeah!!
Thank you! I hope you feel liberated now that you faced the anxiety by voting for that first time. Look forward to future votes!
Good for you.  Our voice is our vote
Thank you. I'm seeing a lot of younger voters in line in Philly as well!
Thank you!
And congrats!
Hell yeah fellow Michigander!
Damn.. Denso let you take a break from your 38 hour shift to vote? Good for you! (Thanks for voting!) (Also BC resident as well. Precinct 17!)
Ope, I’m proud of you!
Thank you!
We got boring stickers down here. 😔
Minnesotan here, me too!
Congrats! Welcome to having an adult voice!
I am so jealous of all of the cute voting stickers Michigan had! I got the basic one and well I’m glad I got my little sticker. I’m bummed It wasn’t something more exciting.
The Midwest really is ope country
Excellent, thank you!
Good on you friend!!
Me too!
Uhhhh - that should be a minnesota sticker!!  Why are ours so boring!
Kgox
Yeah I’m sure we know
I got the same one lol!
The Ope I voted phrase reminds me of a hit song released over a decade ago…..anyone else Remember how to do the Style?!?! THE GANGNAM STYLE
Same
Loser
“Crafting the core.”
Way to go!!!
Wish it worked out.
Trump!!❤️🇺🇸
😂
This was my son's first election as well. Glad to see others as well...
I am so glad that your vote meant nothing!!
So my question for OP, do you guys get annoyed by Japan HQ as much as we do?
What is ope?
I drove 3 hours round trip to get my mom to the polls in Battle Creek Sunday. She's 86 and hates the Mango Mussolini with a purple passion. It was surprisingly calm and friendly. I was expecting riots. 

My brother works at Denso in upper management but couldn't take her himself.
Thank you for your vote! It worked 👊🏾
They all look the same
How did it work out for you
Shitty neck tattoo and little boy facial hair. Checks out.
Your kamala voted proved fruitless 🤡
A vote for Trump is a vote for your future and the security of the nation.  

Vote TRUMP to preserve the constitutional republic we were given so long ago!
Awesome!
[deleted]
I can’t vote till 2032
I use to deliver dedicated to denso every week. Pretty cool people worked there. I left OTR like 2 months before covid. I hear there's a lot of Trump supporters there.
I voted Trump today! Let’s all do our part and make sure Trump wins!!
But did you vote *correctly*?
Nice of you to wear red in support for your voting party.
5 of my friends did today! first time voters too!!
This didn’t age well.
I’ve been an adult for 8 years I just was scared to vote but I did it!
Poor measure of being an adult. Raising children responsibly 👨🏼‍🍳😘
They have the werewolf stickers at all SOS offices. Just go in and ask for one
I need to get a button maker....
you got this! vote for the right side and dont listen to the media.. vote for who you want!
All the stickers are great, but this is my favorite.
Yup. Biden is a creep. Thank god he is in hospice. Maga 2024. Thank you for voting.
I can’t handle another 4 years of trump. I had to do the right thing for democracy and equal rights
I’m a cook at chilis man. I got laid off at Denso. 🙄🤣 the shirts comfy
Straight ticket Rep. thank you for voting.
Yeah I was going to do straight ticket because I also voted for the first time ever. The night before I decided to sit down and actually read about everyone on the ticket, it didn’t change my vote for any of them but it was important for the non-partisan section that I really wanted to fill out with knowledge.
We need to get rid of gretch the wench.
Face to face meetings are a big help
You don't belong here
Then why is he try to destroy the Constitution and the republic by trying to stay in power as an unelected autocrat in 2020?
A vote for trump is a vote for a deranged old man, mentally ill, sexual predator, convicted felon, and best friend of Epstein.
Since you clearly support authoritarianism, you're either a white man or a bot.
It wasn't given.
You've got to be kidding.  Trump tried to overturn the 2020 election with a fake electors scheme and a pressure campaign on state officials to try to get them to break election laws.  He's still facing multiple felony charges for it.

He's now talking about prosecuting and using the military against political opponents in his second term. He's talked about revoking licenses of TV stations. He's stated he believes the president should be immune from prosecution for his acts in office, and his attorney argued in court that that could even include assassinating a political rival.

Trump turned against the principles this country was founded on a long time ago.
Wow. Way to stand by your man. 

You must be that "normal gay" vote JD and trump were really thirsting for.
“To preserve the constitutional Republic, we were given so long ago!”
🤣😂
Well done! A+ satire
Wait I’m confused lol. 🤣
Blue down the board!!
That’s awesome.  Thank you! 
Same my whole friend group went. Trumpy 2024.
That just proves you are now an official adult.
Being brave is important and I salute you. We are the land of the free, the home of the brave, as long as we continually strive to provide liberty and justice for all. Thank you for standing up.
It's never too late to do the right thing!
Great job!  It’s better to do a thing than to live with the fear of it.
Button maker, label maker, hot laminator. They all come in super handy.
We've all gotta do our part
And keep voting in future elections...
![gif](giphy|lPFZyhkUv7X7wFXwih|downsized)
Lmao
Serious question... What happened to you during Trump's presidency that makes you think you can't handle another 4 year of Trump?

Glad you voted.
Ahh, ok. Carry on.
Now get back in that kitchen.
Trump would’ve helped keep manufacturing jobs in America. But enjoy chili’s I guess. You said you were worried about your son’s future when you voted. Best way to give him a better future is by providing as a father.
Why because I don't know what "ope" means??

To us it sure was.  Did you or your dad or grandfather fight the English? Nah.  Some of our ancestors fought for it, and then gave it to us, their posterity, as a gift for all time, or as one guy once said, “for as long as we can keep it.”  If we want to hold onto what they fought for, what they crafted and handed down to us, we have to want it, we have to stand up for it.

Is there an issue with gays?  Not cool bro… no matter who u vote for.
I think what changed everything for was that I wanted to change history, I wanted my wife to have rights and I think that my sons future will be affected if I didnt vote, this wasnt just for me but for my wife and son.
Maga!!!!
yes!!!!
All of the environmental protections he rolled back is a big one for me. We simply cannot afford more years of that as we’re approaching critical climate tipping points. I like having a planet to live on, food to eat, water to drink, etc

(Edit to add I’m also a woman so having basic respect is nice)
January 6th.. that was my final straw, Roe V Wade was the first straw
Hate. The constant message of hate spewing from his mouth. He wants to talk about how bag America is. It's not. The only thing bad in America is him and his hate. 

  
He made it ok for hateful people to voice their hate.

  
I hated it.
Keep Kamala and carry on-ala.
Remember this.. that man will rewrite the constitution and not a single person will have rights, we will become a dictatorship and I REFUSE TO LET THAT FUCKIN HAPPEN. Please for the love of god shut the fuck up trump lover.
It’s a common midwestern saying/sound. It would be used in this way for example, “Ope! I dropped it.” or “Ope! Sorry about that.”
Trump did not win.  There have been multiple recounts and audits.  There was no widespread fraud that would have changed the election results.
>Because there was proven fraud that was later prosecuted, but no one talks about that.

That vast majority of the fraud that has been uncovered was committed by GOP voters... And also that fraud has been nowhere close to the scale that would be needed to influence the outcome of the election.

There were plenty of GOP lead investigations into the election, in GOP lead states. None of them found anything close to the level of fraud needed to impact the election.

Joe Rogan asked Trump point blank: if he has all this evidence, when is he gunna show it? And Trump totally dodged the question (typical). Because he has no evidence, because the kind of massive fraud he claims *never existed*.
Wrong again, kid. He tried to force himself on the USA. Because he's a rapist who tries to take what he wants in the face of rejection. Did this prosecution happen at a military tribunal by any chance?

Yep, you're a white man.  Only they play the race card this frequently.
“A Republic, if you can keep it.” -Ben Franklin after the Constitutional Convention.
That's made up Trump propaganda.  There is no "lawfare."  Trump actually committed crimes, and is getting punished for them.  I don't have my facts "twisted up."  You would only think that if you live in the dishonest alternative reality right-wing media bubble.  You can fact-check everything I said and discover it's true.

I don't care that you are gay.

JD said he thinks him and trump will get the "normal gay vote". That's according to him.

The way you support trump clearly shows you like him more than just a friend. I figured you must be that "normal gay" he wants so badly.

No one said anything bad. You don't need to play victim, no matter how much you are trained to do it.
Great! I hope your wife voted if she was able, also. Mail in and early are making it even easier for people who have a hard time/aren’t comfortable going in person. 

I’m loving the comments from first time voters! We know a few too.
This I understand. However, some of the rolled back protections were costing Americans money while many other countries citizens go on polluting and making money. 

Can you afford 30% higher energy prices? 

I'm just saying, there is another side of the story here.
I see. I didn't like either of those as well, but to be honest, neither event affected my life in the least bit.

Enjoy your day.
Right. Bc according to you the constitution permits a single person to change it. You’re in dreamland. Wake up. Basic knowledge of our government would inform you of the checks & balances to prevent this. Stop being divisive and unrealistic.

A response is neither an initiation, nor a repetition.  Why would you mention it at all?
Climate catastrophe, collapsing of the ecosystems we rely on, increase of natural disasters, climate refugees, and wars over resources will all be a lot more costly and collapse the economy anyways. I know that sounds dramatic but that’s the path we’re headed down if we don’t turn things around. 

Also, fossil fuels are only as “cheap” as they are now because we heavily subsidize them, in the billions of dollars. If we shifted those investments NOW we wouldn’t have that issue. And even with that disadvantage solar is already cheaper! 

I understand it’s a complex issue but “other countries are bad too” just doesn’t cut it for me as an excuse to keep barreling down the path headed for disaster, and having a “leader” who doesn’t even believe climate change is real is absolutely horrifying.
Serious question…when you vote are you only considering your own needs or do you take into account that government affects the lives of everyone in our society?

Oh, look... white male privilege has entered the chat 😒
>neither event affected my life in the least bit.

I think it's legitimately very hard to see a scenario where Jan 6th would have *no* impact on an American. 

It was literally one candidate trying to overturn a free and fair election by use of force and intimidation. I would have thought protecting free and fair elections would have been important to all Americans...
Okay trump supporter.. can’t afford that anymore after trump is elected.. but whatever
I never claimed Rogan was a smart man. Just that he asked a key question and Trump didn't answer it because he doesn't have what he claims to have.

>best man for the job is Trump.

Well on that we certainly don't agree.

How do you know how I vote? This is nothing close to what my comment were about.

I'm glad you are such a social justice warrior. And what have you don't to help the less fortunate? Did you give them a room in your home? Give me break.
[removed]
Yet, my life didn't change one bit. And yes, fair elections are important. 

Did you go out and protect free and fair elections? You are missing my point. 

These days it's too common for many to internalize trauma that did not happen to them, because it is so easy to see and hear about it on TV and the internet, when in reality, most of the time nothing happens in reality to the individual.
I always say Joe Rogan is the stupid person's idea of a smart man and EC Owlbear is proving that.
Omg so edgy 🤪🤪

Don't gaslight people, it's weak.  Very weak.

We know what you are saying, and it's all a crock of shit.
I personally vote for not only myself but my fellow women, and those around me. I couldn’t sit back and say “If it doesn’t affect me, whatever.” Although I can sympathize with those that are struggling to afford food and basic needs right now. Those who voted on those issues and truly felt Trump would change that, I can sympathize with you, even if I don’t agree. 

As far as what we’ve done to help the needy. I think many of us do a lot. Personally, we help the homeless in our city in big ways. We have a man who owns an art studio in town, he offered years ago to allow us to bring items for the homeless to his studio and he would pass them out for the ones that stop by the studio and walk by. 

There is one homeless woman who suffers from schizophrenia and major mood disorders. She’s “famous” around here. The whole city rally’s together for her; but she refuses to live in a home or facility. She’s been given apartments and she just won’t stay. Whenever we see her, which is often, we buy her food and give her cash. We donate blankets and winter clothes. Art studio owner lets her sleep in the studio during the cold days in winter. 

I normally don’t broadcast any of that, because I believe in giving based on doing the right thing and not for back pats. You asked so figured I would add. 

We have a yearly tradition that we started back in 2015 where we randomly choose families in need and donate them Thanksgiving dinner. Everything you would need to make it. 

That’s all done because it’s basic humanity in our opinion. It’s not being a saint, because we arent saints, not even close. We can, so we do. It was that simple. We’re in this together.
You sound psycho? Please get help.

It would impact my life quite a bit if myself (and a majority of other Americans) went out and voted for a candidate, that candidate won a majority of the EC electors... and the other candidate that lost used violence and intimidation to make sure they were installed as president instead.

>Did you go out and protect free and fair elections?

I feel like allowing Jan 6th to happen and then turning around and *just voting for the exact person who orchestrated it* is sending a clear signal that you *don't* think free and fair elections are important. That you don't see those actions as disqualifying for the executive of the country. Even if that isn't what you intend to say, trust me... Trump and those who would mimic his leadership style are paying attention. If this is even close they will learn the lesson that Americans didn't view intimidation and violence as disqualifying. Voting against Trump *is* voting for the integrity of our elections.
We live in a country where people vote and we peacefully transfer power, even when those votes don't lead to the result the party in power hoped for.

Yes. It personally affects me when someone tries to take this freedom away.
Just another empty headed moron.....
Finally an answer with some thought.
Your comment is correct. Just wondering what changed in your life, how did it affect your life? Honest question.
something that your posts lack
That's some Brave New World level copium to argue that because I wasn't personally assaulted during the coup attempt on January 6 that it didn't threaten my personal liberty
'They abandoned me': Michigan couple ditched adopted son in Jamaica
"An adopted teen who was sent to Jamaica begged to come home after being abused, but says his wealthy, born-again parents don't want him back".

He's 17, his name is Elijah Goldman, he was a successful Traverse City HS student but was sent to one of those abusive "troubled teen" "schools" for such "misdeeds" as watching porn. 

Paris Hilton is currently leading the charge against this industry. The abuse was so bad Jamaica SHUT THE SCHOOL DOWN and his parents still left him abandoned in Jamaica for another seven months. 

The descriptions of the abuse are harrowing. Currently a lawyer and a child welfare advocate are helping him. 

The "parents" live in Traverse City, are millionaires, and are named Mark and Spring Goldman.
Oh what the FUCK

These people are monsters
Can someone explain why the county he and his adoptive parents have a legal residence in is NOT obligated to take care of this child? How are the parents not facing charges?
[deleted]
"born again" said it all to me. 

My manager at a large corporate company was a "born again" Christian and man, this guy was the most sadistic asshole towards me and everyone who was not white, Christian or hetero.
Horrific story fuck those “parents”. I hope he can rescue his sister from that abuse. The ditzy party girl was always partially an act with Paris Hilton but I’m still impressed she is personally taking time to help these kids, not just paying others to do it which is still commendable.
Wow, absolutely insane abuse story. Is it wrong for me to feel as though public doxxing of these two parents is moral in this situation? They’re clearly dodging justice against child abuse through their wealth and legal loopholes. Like, how are they just living their lives as though nothing’s happening? Of course it’s ultra-conservative nutjobs who bend religion to their abusive tendencies.
If anyone is part of the overheard in traverse fb page post it there.
Well they must have some local pull too because I live local to them and I don’t think this has been touched on at all by local news outlets. Fucking disgusting behavior by the Goldmans. I hope Elijah is able to find peace and that there is some justice served in the end.
Wow I live in TC and am some how not surprised
Paywall removed: https://archive.is/LbwVr
Man, this story is so much worse than I imagined, which was bad enough. I shouldn't have read it before bed. Hope the kids get a better home and hope the parents get exactly what they deserve.
Fuck you mark and spring
Jesus Christ….I would take this kid in myself if I thought it was possible or could help.   I can’t afford to send him to college but I got a room and can afford his necessities.  

Has anyone started something like a gofundme for him?  At 17 he’s almost an adult and possibly could look at college in his future if was a good student and athlete it shouldn’t be hard to get accepted somewhere, especially with his story.  I’m sure we could crowd fund 4 years of room, board, and tuition.

And I wouldn’t care if he watched porn….i do too.  lol.
Absolutely horrendous, fucking awful parents. 

News flash assholes, sex is a part of life, teens need education and not shaming and abuse because of extreme religious views.

Also adding in Paris Hilton is genuinely sweet, I have seen interviews with her reflecting on the harassment she faced and how she is protecting her daughter.
God's love shown through Christian parents
Friendly reminder that the troubled teen industry is a seething mass of abuse and cruelty. An autobiographical comic everyone should read (but is deeply upsetting) is this one about a survivor of those systems. https://elan.school/

Once again, it’s a deeply, profoundly upsetting read, seriously, don’t read this if you’re in a bad headspace.
Our foster care system in this state is a fucking joke. No one cares about those kids, and they’re the ones that need the most care and love. The parents also need to be held responsible, idc how rich they are
It’s not quite the same situation but Elijah’s story reminds me of the [child exchanges](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/adoption/#article/part1) where kids adopted from other countries are “rehomed” when their adoptive parents feel like they’re too troublesome. It feels like Elijah’s parents were trying to “rehome” him in these atrocious facilities instead.
r/raisedbynarcissists
Next time I’m in TC, I might have to post some fliers about this.
Paris Hilton?  Well I'm glad she's using her fame for something worthwhile.  Hopefully the young man will be able to put this bullshit behind him and thrive
What an awful story. These adoptive parents can go fuck themselves in prison. Maybe they'll find some more weird friends they can connect with there. 

Not to take away from the kid, but how on earth did Paris Hilton of all people get connected to this? It's great that she's using her platform for good and everything, but it just seems random.
This really threw me for a loop when I saw the headline because former Kentucky governor Matt Bevin and his wife did the *exact same thing* to one of their adopted children—abandoned him at a Jamaican “school” like this. This article is behind a paywall but the school in the story about the Bevins was called Atlantis Leadership Academy.

These people who abandon their kids like this should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. How they can live with themselves is beyond me—the only possible explanation is that they have no conscience or soul.
[Spring Goldman’s Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/springpgoldman?igsh=MTZpeWhxcmQydmhy) 

Check out the tags on this bitch’s bio . . .
Apparently he’s a special education instructional assistant too (according to his Facebook profile) This guys job is to work with special needs children…
This for real feels like those w. Virginia & Washington cases where people basically have been trying to adopt slaves.

I feel so terrible for this kid, he needs stability, safety, and a whole lotta unconditional love asap.
This is disgraceful.    How the Goldmans came to be parents is irrelevant.    They abandoned their child in a foreign country.   Abandoned.  Violated left him for dead.   This should be prosecuted offense.   An Adopted child has the same rights as a birth child.  When you have a child you must protect them.   And rearing children is hard for everyone!
This is monstrous. I truly hope the parents are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.
This story is wild. I hope the parents are shamed and their reputation is tarnished. 

Grew up with a couple of friends who were subjected to abuse by religious caretakers. The stories they would tell me made me so angry.
Wow...absolutely heartbreaking. This is where I live. How could someone do that to their child. Heartless people
The former governor of KY did the same thing to his kid.  That guy is an asshole 

https://www.wkyt.com/2024/08/08/former-ky-governor-matt-bevins-adopted-son-back-us-report-says/
If you’re local there’s a hearing at the Traverse City Courthouse Wednesday morning at 8:30a.
Read the story on USA Today.  The kid got good grades and was an athlete in his HS.  He discovered porn. The parents sent him off to a 'troubled teen academy' in Jamaica where he was abused because he had a 'porn addiction'!  He was a fucking teen who discovered porn for cripes sake. Instead of, oh I don't know, taking away his wifi access and his devices, giving him chores, or maybe making him do a research paper on the porn industry, like normal parents, they send him off to Jamaica and ignore him.  They won't take him back and they're not facing any legal repercussions!!  Oh and they're "Christians".
as an adopted person myself, THIS exact scenario was my ultimate fear growing up. i feel so terribly for this young man. fuck those assholes, they're completely inhumane.
update:  they successfully got Elijah placed in the custody of local CPS, with the Goldmans consenting to the deal. That paves the way for Elijah to move in with a foster parent — in this case, a retired schoolteacher in the Traverse City area who came forward this week and offered to take him in.
I never imagined I’d say this, but thank God for Paris Hilton. 🥺 She is saving children who have no one to speak for them.
This is awful, I hope the parents get their comeuppance for it.

It's always surprised me that none of the kids abused at these "troubled teen" camps has decided to go back and settle a few scores once they become an adult.
This is behind a paywall for me. Anyone have the article text extracted out that they can post here?
Omfg… because Jesus?!?!? I bet Mark and Spring pride themselves in “family values”…
That’s really heartbreaking!
And they still have photos of him all over their Facebook.
He’s a teacher at my kids school.
Dude, this kid was in my class when he first came to traverse city, I went to parties at his house he was like the nicest kid literally everyone loved him
It wasn't until Sept. 3 that Elijah returned to the U.S., when Jamaican authorities put him on a plane and flew him to Florida. There, a man sent by his adoptive parents had come to pick him up and take him to Utah to live. Elijah refused because he said he doesn't know anyone in Utah, and he doesn't trust the man who would take him there     So Florida CPS officials sent him home to Michigan. 

Last Thursday, he was flown to Traverse City, where he has been holed up in a hotel room ever since — still anxious about what's to come. He is prohibited from leaving the room and going outdoors. And his parents have had his cellphone and tablet taken away..
The Goldmans, who reportedly have told their son that moving back home is not an option, are expected to explain what prompted them to send their son to boarding schools, why the boy was left alone in Jamaica for seven months, and why they believe Utah is the best place for him now.

That latter part is what has Elijah's advocates all riled up. They say sending Elijah to Utah is not an option, especially given the parents' other plan: Once Elijah is in Utah, he would be placed in the care of a transport agent, the same man who took him to the Jamaican school against his will, the same school where he and six other American boys alleged abuse of all sorts, including waterboarding, whippings, beatings and starvation.

How the fuck is Michigan's whole goal in this to get the parents off? Hold these pieces of shit accountable!!!!! And THEY LET THEM SEE HIMWITHOUT HIS PERMISSION. Awful nightmare dad was waiting for him at the airport and gross cruella mom stalked him to cps and tried to guilt trip him with sobs and hugs. They should be in JAIL
Fuck these parents and the horse they rode in on.
As someone who started watching porn at a young age, yes it is bad, but sending a child away is not the way to deal with it
There's a special place in Hell for this couple... Mark and Spring Goldman will go to Hell.. Mark my words.. pun intended.. "The shoes you're wearing,  don't make the man!" Direct quote from Clint Black.. so true...
What the actual hell. I’m no millionaire, but I’d find a way to get him here and give him a home.
Lol there should be major fines and imprisonment...why is there not? They just paid people to look the other way
The Goldman's have that "look", especially the wife..that 'see you next Tuesday' look in her face permanently fixed. All because he was a little rebellious and was not living up to their so-called "Christian" ways. Even before I opened the USA today article on this story earlier, I had this awful feeling is was going to be one of "those schools"....a school in Jamaica run by Americans (first red flag). A school for troubled teens and supposedly christian based (second red flag). Elijah endured some pretty awful things and it's disgusting the Goldman's just sit there and deny all wrongdoing of blatant neglect and deny any abuse occurred at the school, despite the fact the school was shut down by government order and four staff charged with various abuse related crimes. Strong evidence the Goldmans dismiss out of hand. Isn't one of the central tenets of Christianity to basically confess and accept and own your wrongdoing (sins)? Ironic, isn't it. The Goldman's I'm willing to bet are members of one of those cults that claims to be some purified denomination. A few easily come to mind...
At least Elijah has a new home and an apparently caring woman to call family. He hasn't had that in a long time. 
According to ChatFGPT....

In Michigan, child abandonment is considered a serious offense and is categorized under child neglect laws. Here are some key points:

1. Definition: Child abandonment involves leaving a child without supervision or in a harmful environment because the custodial parent or guardian is unwilling or unable to care for the child’s health and welfare.
2. Age Limit: The laws cover children who are 17 years old and younger.
3. Penalties: Abandoning a child can result in a felony conviction, with a sentence ranging from one to three years in prison

Sounds absolutely horrendous. I truly hope that the people (I can't call them parents) can be charged with abuse. What they did to him is truly criminal. 

       Bit of a gripe now it's great when Op's give links not so great when they lead to a pay wall.

Remember children! ALL POLITICIANS ARE SCUMBAGS!
Years ago I got into it with an adoptive parent defending the practice of rehoming adoptees where they asked, “well, what would you do if your kid was completely unmanageable?” And I was like, “suck it up, dumbass. You think I can go ditch my seven year old twins at the firehouse because “boohoohoo this is too hard, I prefer being a drug-addled fuck-up to being a responsible parent.”? I mean, Jesus effin Christ man, who the fuck doesn’t? 

I got pregnant on accident. Adoptive parents sign up for this. How is it I know the rules better than they do?
You see these are the type of people who deserve to have  their fingers, kneecaps and elbows broken on the joints  then pushed down a set of stairs and be  completely conscious when the crabs and rats come for them. 

Alternatively scattering Legos on the floor of their bedroom in the middle of the night and then upending a bag of approximately 900 very pissed off bullet ants over each of them in the dark as they are sleeping would also be acceptable. 

For context: bullet ants have the most agonizingly painful sting of all insects:

“According to the Schmidt Sting Pain Index. The bullet ant's sting is described as "pure, intense, brilliant pain" that feels like being shot or walking on flaming charcoal. The pain can last for up to 24–36 hours and can cause muscle contractions and a burning sensation.”

The Legos on the floor in the dark should be self-explanatory.
Guess what, all teenagers are hard work and pretty much 80% min watch porn.  Grow up born again pricks.  I hope they go to jail for this.

I am very, VERY confused how the Goldmans (and now the adoption oversight officials in Grand Traverse County) are not being held 100% responsible for the plight of this poor kid. 
He is a minor child, and was a legal citizen of the State of Michigan. The fact that he was adopted (or his bad behavior) does not deter from that central fact — **he is legally Mark & Spring Goldman’s child.**

If I ditched my kid in a foreign country, there is no doubt that I could (and should) be charged with abandonment and/or neglect. Child endangerment, at minimum. 

And what is to become of this young man’s sister, who appears to still be in the Goldman’s care? It’s insane to read that the state allowed the Goldman’s to essentially wash their hands of one child…while still being allowed to be the caretakers of his younger sibling.
> the county

The politics in that area are a fucking joke...ultra fucking conservatives live there.
Millionaires abide by a completely different set of rules than you and I.
Sounds like they paid off the state? 

Someone should ask the AG for a comment.

Like, broooo
I am so glad you archived his "faith journey" article because I just read that and holy crap, what a pretentious twat that man is.
I shared on the Traverse City sub and emailed the governor at 3am..this is absolutely unacceptable and it seems like as of Thursday Elijah is back with Mark and Spring. 
Thank you for posting, this is the third result when I googled "mark and spring goldman of traverse city"
that blog 🤮 what a disgusting human 
Edit: this needs to be watched and shared everywhere [Paris Hilton advocates](https://youtu.be/2f-kYZ3YOYo?si=dohJqJcfD9M_Oyx0)
Family business of course; the crazy religious are always a family business.
Oh good....this problem will take care of itself now...
Please share all this everywhere. Free press link paywalled and everyone should read these

I think they blocked part of the story. It says "click for more" & I cannot access it
They're always just SOOOOOO faithful. Wonderfully accurate portrayal of Christian Values.
THEY STILL HAVE HIM POSTED
There’s a reason sadists are drawn to religion, it gives them permission to abuse and feel sanctimonious about it at the same time.
Telling quote:


"My life is not perfect, nor is my marriage. I am also not always proud of how I father my children either, but one thing I do have is a God who loves me and has a place for me waiting in heaven. Can I get an Amen?"


Basically "I suck, but I believe in God so it's fine." Then he basically throws up his hand for a high five. What a douchebag.
> "born again"

I only knew one "born again" person...he was a piece of shit who literally used the "I'm going to heaven no matter what so I can sin all I want" mentality they all have.  HE was OPENLY prideful of being able to sin however he wanted without fear.
And they believe once they are "saved" (which they literally say a prayer and declare "I'm saved!") they can't become "unsaved" and are righteous people no matter what they do.  And most of them do plenty.
The act was actually a way she coped with her PTSD after having been tortured in similar 'programs'. She's talked about it in more recent interviews.

I really respect her for what she's done so far in trying to get these shut down.
Ever since learning about her ordeal my views about her changed. I didn't hate her, just wasn't my style of entertainment. 

Now that I know..I see it as a defense/coping mechanism kind of behavior. 

I'm so glad she's speaking out and actually doing something for kids in similar situations. 
Many talk, not many do anymore. It's nice to see her doing something
If public shaming is what it takes to put a stop to this disgusting behavior then I say let’s start buying up billboards, my bitches.
Might want to edit your comment, as this is not doxxing - they're named in the article.
Totally unreasonable to expect adults to be held accountable for their actions.
No doxxing necessary, they've just got their shit all over the internet for all to see! 
What they are doing is criminal. Criminals don't get to hide.
Someone post it here https://www.facebook.com/groups/overheardintraversecity
You know what to do.
Totally agree. I hope people take the warning in the post about the abuse descriptions seriously.

I grew up being beaten to unconsciousness regularly; what this article describes is way, way worse.
I would love if someone started a GoFundMe for him. This poor kid. His birthday probably can't come soon enough so he can start making his own decisions instead of being ping-ponged from place to place.
Thankfully, some angel named Terri did step up to take him in after his lawyers successfully shut down the Goldman’s plan to send him to live in Utah against his will. The adopters (I can’t even bring myself to call them parents) happily signed custody over to CPS this morning. But the more I read about this story the more enraged I get. I cannot believe these people are not being charged with anything.  I hope his sister gets out of there.

Here’s an article with updates from this morning: https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2024/09/11/michigan-boy-abandoned-adoptive-parents-jamaica-elijah-goldman/75173108007/
Not that this should have happened to *any* kid, but FWIW the children in this case were adopted by the Goldmans - they weren’t foster children living in a temporary home.
MDHHS is always looking for foster parents. Feel free to sign up.
Holy shit.  I’ve never seen this sub.  I haven’t even clicked on the link yet but I know I’ve found my home.   Thank you.
If you make the flyer, I'll post it. I have absolutely no design skills and my printer is black and white, but I'd do it.
I guess this got recommended to me because I’m from Jamaica. But she was on the island a few months ago, no one in the press knew. My friend saw her and we wondered why she was in that area (it’s a tourist spot but there’s more exclusive spots for her celebrity status). 

Then the story broke about the school in the local news and then I heard she was an advocate for this stuff in the US news. We put two and two together and I’m impressed she went in person to deal with this issue.

I feel sorry for that boy, who knows what he endured in the Jamaican “foster” system. He would have definitely have a target in his back when the other boys knew he was a foreigner and an American one at that.
Paris Hilton became an advocate as a result of the abuse she experienced at a boarding school, I believe it was. The more I watch what she is doing, the more I admire her.
She was sent to one of these torture factories as a teen. It gave her PTSD. Now she advocates against them. She's done interviews about it, spoken to Congress about it, and runs a nonprofit for it.
Elijah was also at the Atlantis Leadership Academy. Here's a link to an archived story from Lansing State Journal: https://archive.is/mmod9
Yeah, I was recommended this and this was also my first thought. It makes me absolutely sick this happened to multiple children. It's almost unbelievable.
Oh god international adoption :/

https://ayibopost.com/the-serious-consequences-of-disorderly-adoption-in-haiti/
It's disgusting they still have pictures of him, even in the profile picture
Yup.
After months of languishing in an abusive boarding school in Jamaica — where boys said they were beaten, waterboarded, starved and whipped — Michigan teenager Elijah Goldman begged to come home.

But his adoptive parents in Traverse City never came for him: Not even after Jamaican authorities removed him from the American-run school, placed him in a foster home, shut down the school following allegations of abuse and neglect, and arrested and charged four school officials with child abuse.

Rather, Elijah's mom and dad — a wealthy and conservative Christian couple who adopted him from Haiti when he was 11 — left him in Jamaica for another seven months, while his American friends were brought home.

Alone and afraid, Elijah suffered in silence in a foreign land, desperate for someone to rescue him, to take him back to the quaint Michigan town where he was a track star, went to school, had a girlfriend and hung out with friends.
They abandoned me ... it hurts'
"I appreciate them for bringing me to the U.S., but they abandoned me," Elijah, now 17, wrote to the Free Press one recent night, while still waiting to be rescued from Jamaica. "I'm staying strong, but it hurts."

In a harrowing child welfare case that has sparked international interest, including that of celebrity icon and advocate for troubled teens Paris Hilton, who has intervened in Elijah's case, children's rights activists are seeking to draw attention to a pervasive problem and dark side of adoption — abandonment of the vulnerable.

It's where parents adopt troubled children, but then change their minds in a buyer's-remorse kind of way, because the kids come with too many issues. So they send them away, never to see them again.

That's what child welfare advocates say they believe happened to Elijah, whose adoptive parents sent him to an American-run boarding school in Treasure Beach, Jamaica, in September 2023, over behavior problems — including watching pornography — and allegedly ditched him in the process.

They never visited him, nor attended any of his court hearings, where Elijah and other boys disclosed allegations of horrific abuse they endured at the school called the Atlantis Leadership Academy. Elijah said he was cut with a razor and beaten in the back with a hammer. Other boys reported being waterboarded with a hose up the nose, tied to railings by the neck and beaten, and being forced to engage in club fights, where staff and local police would place bets.

The allegations prompted Jamaican officials to remove Elijah and six other American boys from the academy in February and place them in Jamaican custody. One month later, they closed the school down.

Still, Elijah's adoptive parents never came.

Elijah said the last time he heard from his adoptive parents was in April, when they called during a court proceeding. When asked what his adoptive parents told him, he said: "They didn't want me home. ... And they didn't believe me about the whole court thing ... that they were abusing us."

The Free Press made numerous attempts to speak to Elijah's parents. Multiple voicemails and text messages were left for both parents. The mom responded by text, stating: "If you would please send us your questions in writing we can consider responding." The Free Press sent a list of questions on Wednesday morning, and left more voicemails and text messages. As of Friday evening, the couple had not responded. Michigan officials reportedly told a lawyer and advocate for Elijah that the adoptive parents told them that they had a plan to get Elijah out of Jamaica but were advised not to travel there.

Lawyer: Biological parent would not get away with this
Elijah's case has drawn the ire of child welfare advocates, who maintain biological parents would not get away with abandoning a minor child in a foreign country for a year, especially when the child is reporting abuse.

"They were specifically told, 'Your son was abused.' And they didn’t even send him clothes," said New York children's rights attorney Dawn Post, who traveled to Jamaica in the spring, met with Elijah, and has been fighting for him ever since.

"What makes it so astounding is that that these wealthy parents think they can get away with it," Post said of Elijah's adoptive parents, who live in a $1.7 million lakefront home in Traverse City that was named "The Southern Living Home of the Year" in 2007.

Post said she believes Elijah's mom and dad are getting preferential treatment from Michigan authorities because they are adoptive parents, not biological.

"If it was a biological parent — believe me — you'd have an abandonment case against them," said Post, noting she has reached out to multiple government agencies in Michigan about Elijah's case, including the governor's office, Department of Health and Human Services, and Child and Protective Services in Traverse City.

But so far, she said, no one has stepped in to help Elijah resume his life in Michigan, or to hold his adoptive parents accountable for stranding him in Jamaica.

Elijah returns to U.S., fate uncertain
Elijah is back on American soil, though his future remains uncertain. He was returned to the U.S. on Tuesday after Jamaican authorities put him on a plane and sent him to Florida, where American officials would take over and address his needs.

But since landing in Florida, his life has been a nonstop series of traumatic events, with no government agency stepping up to take him in. Florida said he was Michigan's responsibility. Michigan said he was Florida's responsibility.

His adoptive parents did not meet him at the Miami airport.

Rather, Post was there. So was an abuse survivor and youth advocate named Chelsea Maldonado, who works as a consultant to Paris Hilton's charity known as 11:11 Media Impact, which works to protect vulnerable youths from mistreatment, particularly those in residential facilities.

"He’s been abandoned and let down by every person who was in a position to offer him care, love and support," Maldonado said of Elijah, stressing the troubled teen industry preys on adopted youth. "No child should be adopted into this country only to be abandoned, or sent to a place like Atlantis Leadership Academy ... This must end."

Elijah arrived at the airport in jeans and a pullover fleece, carrying all of his belongings in a single backpack. A fellow survivor from the now-shuttered boarding school was there to greet Elijah, who smiled as he hugged his friend in the arrivals terminal. But the nervous teen kept looking over his shoulder. And in a matter of minutes, a daunting scene played out.

A U.S. embassy official from Jamaica, a police officer and a youth transport agent whom Elijah did not want to leave with, showed up. They whisked him away from his friend and advocates and took him into a room to discuss matters privately.

In the end, Elijah was spared having to leave with the transport agent — the man his adoptive parents had designated as his legal guardian; the same man they hired to take Elijah to the airport when they sent him to Jamaica against his wishes in 2023; the same man who wrote a letter of recommendation on behalf of the academy where Elijah and the others reportedly were abused.

Elijah said this transport agent had manipulated him into going to Jamaica and that he didn't trust him with his future.

Neither did his lawyer, or his youth advocate, who both made sure to be at the airport to protect Elijah and place him in safe hands.

From Jamaica to Florida to Michigan — Elijah finally sees his adoptive parents
Elijah arrived in Miami just before 6 p.m. Tuesday. By 8 p.m., he was in a car with the two advocates who showed up to help him, away from his adoptive parents' chosen legal guardian, eager to begin a new life.

"I'm the happiest man alive," he wrote in a message to the Free Press on Tuesday night.

Within 24 hours, however, he would learn that Michigan authorities said they had no legal authority over him; that housing him in Michigan was out of their hands, and that his lawyer needed to talk to Child Protective Services in Florida and find a place for him there.

"This is beyond insane," Post said.

By midnight Wednesday, more than 24 hours after landing in Miami, Elijah was in Florida CPS custody, housed in a children's home.

"Everything is good," Elijah wrote to the Free Press.

By morning, however, his life was upended again. Florida CPS placed him on a flight to Traverse City. Elijah said he didn't know who would meet him there, neither did his lawyer.

"As a mom of 4 and a owner of multiple businesses I have become incredibly passionate about empowering others to see their potential and create a life of abundance," her LinkedIn page reads. "By serving and loving others and helping them to succeed I am changing lives one person at a time."

In a personal essay about his faith journey, Mark Goldman also discusses changing lives, specifically his own. On a faith-inspired business website called Check Your Game, Mark Goldman wrote about a prior rage issue, and how a verbal fight with his wife almost triggered a call to the police, and eventually led him to Jesus Christ.

"The following morning, I decided! I was done thinking I could fix all my issues with booze, gambling, working out and pornography. I needed to try something else," Mark Goldman says in the essay, which credits his mom with turning him to Jesus Christ following a 2008 fight with his wife.

The personal essay also mentions Mark Goldman "waiting to be matched with our two kiddos from Haiti," how he "left a multimillion-dollar company" to work in a school setting, and how he and his wife "brought our 2 kids from Haiti home with us" in 2018.
How do you feel about that?
Why is this in quotes?
I posted the archive links in the first comment on the post.
Shut up. He was a sixteen year old child that they sent away to be abused. Mark and Spring should be in jail and their other children should be placed with better parents.
Fine then lets let 16 year olds smoke, own guns, vote, and anything else an adult can

Oh wait 16 and 17 are considered minors and its illegal to abandon a minor. Oops, guess if you are rich illegal shit is now just "not a great look"

That's a stretch to consider from this story. And in fact, most of the people involved would be unelected civil servants.
Our family adopted a child.  He gave us hell for years.  We never gave up on him because he's family.  He's doing better every year.  If he was about to be hit by a bus I'd jump in front of the bus to save him because he's our child.
Cause I feel a lot of them aren’t doing it out the goodness of their hearts
>well, what would you do if your kid was completely unmanageable?”

Sometimes my 5 year old REALLLY pushes my buttons. And when she does I think to myself "Well, what are you gonna do? Drop her off at a firestation? No? That's what I thought. Take a breath and deal" It always gives me a chuckle and diffuses my anger a bit because it's a ridiculous reaction to a kid being a kid. 

It's alarming that an adoptive parent thinks this is a feasible option.
I think too many are evangelicals on a mission from Jesus to collect as many kids as they can. They’re therapy resistant, overly reliant on faith, and blind to the needs of their kids. It has to be this unconditional love, and while they may love their kids, I think they provide a conditional love.

So the kids either cave to suppressing their feelings, stay silent, or burn up and are never spoken of again.

Reminds me of some true crime tv show. A girl from russia had been adopted by multiple families who abandoned her because of some kind of behavior issues.
I watched horrifying documentary on how easy it is to rehome adopted children. Churches literally host pageants where the kids prove they are good enough for homes. And it’s a simple monetary transaction. Family #2 doesn’t have to pass any sort of background check or anything. Once the kid has been adopted the first time. The government considers it case closed. 

The people looking to purchase rehomed kids are pretty much exactly as you expect. Church folk with a scary something in their eyes.
Doxxing isn't a /Michigan rule, it's a reddit site-wide rule.  Posting anything more than what's in the article is an easy way to get your account suspended by the Reddit admins.
They’re rich. That is why. They’re rich.

I was a social worker in MI for years and interacted with CPS a lot. They’re basically powerless and if you have money, you can hire a CPS specialized attorney. 

When I worked at the children’s hospital, we had a few cases of (biological, poor) parents refusing to come get their kids; if they continued to refuse, we had to call CPS and the police for child abandonment who **always** forced the parents to take them home (because the parents were threatened with charges).
> I am very, VERY confused

Literally grand traverse county...that's how.
🙌🙌🙌
Abandoning the kid in a foreign country also means the kid doesn't have the documentation to even work while over there, not above the table.  No ID or papers other than a passport and maybe a US ID.  This is a really rotten thing to do.  It's not unheard of for parents to disown their child because he is gay or something, but to do it in another country is next level rotten.

Michigan just showing they care as much about the kids as Epstein
I’d love to know what adoption agency they used and if it’s not Bethany I will be shocked.
Good Ole religion/Christianity- no matter how much you “pray”, go to church on Sunday and write blogs about how faithful you are, still doesn’t cover up the fact that you’re a real piece of shit and your imaginary faith does nothing for you for being that way.
I know way too many Christian’s who use their faith as actual justification for their shitty behavior. After all, gods on their side so how could what their doing possibly be wrong? Then those same fuck twats will lament how the young hate church now.
I felt the same. I also hope there are people in the sub more influential than me that might be able to help.

Only 2 kinds of people in religions. Predators and Prey
Yup this is the mentality ALL born agains have...it's why they're drawn to it.  They're told they're NOT actually bad people doing bad things...it's just "weakness."  BUT AS LONG AS YOU BELIEVE IN JESUS.......

Which enables them to go out and do their bad stuff with impunity.  They actually feel complled and JUSTIFIED in doing the bad things.
RIGHT! Holy crap. 

I hope the kid is alright
I've known a few born-agains and they were all crazier and meaner than shithouse rats. The worst thing about them is their smugness. God, they're so fucking smug. 
SAME. This manager i mentioned was the first and only I met and that was his exact behavior! 

Dude told me I'm going to hell because I'm not Christian 😂
Yep! He decided to go through with it after a heart attack in 2019-2020. Prior to that he didn't care about religion. 

He's also a minister at a church after he was "saved"
Oh wow I miss those..I didn't know. Was also a kid when she seemed the biggest. Good for her though to keep getting better from that.
I literally cannot do that, but that’s also beside the point. The point is the system doesn’t care about the kids so nothing is gonna get fixed and the parents are rich enough to pay off the state to not get charged with child abuse. And the state is gonna throw it under the rug like they do with most child abuse cases bc they couldn’t care less. It’s a broken system.
I can't spend to much time there, myself. Half the posts make me feel bad for complaining about my own problems.
I was telling my gf about this and she said the same thing. I'm glad she is able to bounce back and help others in shitty situations.
Oh my god. This poor kid. I don’t even have words for what I think of his “parents”…the only people not failing him are the ones trying so desperately to help him and being thwarted by people trying to send him back to the people who abused and abandoned him. The fact that there are other kids in the home is horrifying, and the classism of the whole situation is appalling. We have people who get investigated by CPS for having their kid play at an adjacent playground while they work for crap wages at McDonald’s, but these people skate by because they’re unbelievably rich so they just do what they want with zero consequences.

Also, “I’m not a perfect parent/person” is basically Track 1 on “The Abusive POS Parent’s Greatest Hits” compilation.
Just before 2 p.m. Thursday, his flight landed in Traverse City.

"My adopted dad is here," Elijah wrote in a message to the Free Press. "They said I have to go with him. He's acting like everything is normal."

Elijah and his dad met with CPS in Traverse City. He said CPS told him he had to go with his dad to Detroit, get on a plane, and go to Utah where he would join the transport agent who had taken him to Jamaica, and get an apartment in Utah to live.

Elijah refused.

As of 6 p.m. Thursday, he was sitting in the rain in the CPS parking lot, waiting for his lawyer to arrive from Florida and pick him up. His mom showed up at one point. She went up to him, and clutched him sobbing, saying she just wanted to see him.

Elijah said he felt "confused."

"I don't think they love me anymore," he wrote to the Free Press after leaving the parking lot in his lawyer's car. "But we do have some good memories."

Camping was one of them.

Friday came with more uncertainty. Lawyers filed a neglect petition with a court in Traverse City, along with a motion requesting Elijah be placed in protective custody. As of Friday evening, there was no resolution.

Elijah went back to a hotel, pending a Wednesday hearing date.

Parents respond: 'I'm not always proud of how I father my children'
Elijah's adoptive parents are Mark and Spring Goldman, of Traverse City. They have denied multiple requests to speak to the Free Press. According to public records, LinkedIn pages, child advocates familiar with the couple, and a prior essay written by the dad, here is a glimpse into the Goldmans' lives:

The couple have two children of their own and adopted two other children from Haiti, including Elijah and Elijah's younger sister, who is 12 and still lives with the Goldmans. The family lives in a sprawling, white colonial that is listed at $1.7 million on Zillow, and $1.9 million on Realtor.com. Mark Goldman, 54, spent years working for his family's real estate and restaurant business before leaving that career to work in special education.

His wife, Spring Goldman, 51, describes herself on her LinkedIn page as a working mom and self-employed health and wellness consultant.

You are god sent.  I was adopted, and was a MAJOR fuck up from 13-the time I moved out (and got married) at 17.  My parents could have, and looking back probably should have sent me somewhere or killed me.  I won’t get into all I did (we’re not talking small stuff either), but I thank god they kept giving and trying.  If not for them, I’d be dead or in jail by now.  Both are still alive, and I’m now mid 40s and turned out to be a pretty decent and above average successful person, all due to them.  I’m so soooo very lucky, and just wanted to say thank you for not giving up reatona!!

Edit…oh wow, I just realized this was the MI sub…I grew up in the D from birth/adoption to 25…now in TX.  You sound like exactly what my mother would say…Thank you again!!
Here’s the thing: the child is always the gift.

And I don’t mean that in a hokey, Hallmark way.

I mean even in the surly, disgusting, mundane, rebellious and insulting even abusive teenager way - parenting is the honor and responsibility. There are a million ways to duck this responsibility. Children have no way to duck existing and needing care - sometimes intense care.

Parenting is hard as fuck, and parenting a deeply traumatized child (and it’s always traumatizing to be removed from your birth family, even in the extremely narrow circumstances that it’s the best option for the kid) is harrowing.

But *BEING* a traumatized kid is even harder, and deserves to be centered when we talk about adoptive families.

And we as a society abandon so many children and parents and families, especially the more marginalized.

But the way we elevate adoptive parents as heroes is gross and horrible. The adoptive kids are almost always surviving way more than the parents and we ignore that part.

Yes, give the parents and kids and families tons of support.

But let’s always remember the kids are the gift, and parenting them is an honor and a gift, not an act of generosity.
These kids are by and large traumatized. They have abandonment issues because, well, they were abandoned. It takes YEARS of proving that trauma wrong for a child to finally heal.
Yeah the (usually white) savior complex wears off really quick when things get hard.
I'd tell mine that I was gonna trade her in for a nice quiet potted silk plant. lol.  It instantly made her giggle and shifted the mood.  Once when she was in middle school I actually looked up Swiss boarding schools and fantasized shipping her off to one of them.  It was a nice little daydream.
My oldest was such a pain that he wanted to  enlist in the ARMY at age 5.   SO I LET HIM!  LOL
Ooof, forcing these "parents" to take these poor kids home seems like they're asking for the situation to end in tragedy.  There's really no good solution to these situations.  That had to be a very difficult job.
CPS in in Michigan is abysmal. Read a report where a woman who just had another baby she was struggling to care for told the worker she was scared she would shake the baby to make him stop crying. They left the baby in her care. They said the fact she was worried was an indication she wouldn't actually do it. wtf. Spoiler. She did.
Are you still a CPS worker? The laws have changed a ton in the last 5 years and it’s next to impossible to remove a kid from their home. It’s fucked up. I’ve seen kids left in really bad situations because of newer CPS policies.
I did PS & Foster Care in MI. More than once after having an assigned case it "disappeared" overnight off the computer & hard file copy. Going to a "special unit." Always so many secrets, but found out these are MI people w deep pockets & clout. No record anywhere of the cases ever in the system.
The best thing about Grand Traverse is their pie. /s
Can you elaborate?  I’m totally ignorant on the agency or significance of it - would love the tea
Which is wild since Jesus had very strong things to say about those sorts of people.

Have they even read the Bible?
Unfortunately, I think the article indicates there's no way he's all right, being back with them.
I have actually worked in the system, and you are denigrating a lot of hard-working people. I was there sitting by kids in the ER. I was calling to find placements. I was making sure they were in school, seeing the doctor, dentist, and therapist. I was in court advocating for them. I was getting foster parents reimbursed for gymnastics, ballet, art classes, etc. I was confronting parents for using meth over prioritizing their kids. So, no, you don't get to belittle the work of thousands of people because of one situation with two rich assholes and one child. This one situation does not mean that no workers anywhere care about kids in the system. It's easy to criticize, but you are not volunteering to make it any better, so who really doesn't care about the kids?
People could have had vacations, college paid for, designer clothes, and braces, yet still have a high ACEs score.

Turns out the parents are the control freaks here, not everyone else. I feel sorry for any children you have as im feeling you gonna be like "heres 175 dollars, court is over there, im done" the moment they turn 16

I wasn't a major fuckup but had extremely religious parents. They sent me away at 17 for losing my virginity. Also, I currently live in the D grew up in Oregon. Glad some people have some non crazy religious parents that adopt. 

With that being said my parents now have chilled out with the religious bullshit over the last 8 years. I'm in my 30s and honestly wish there was something I could do to spread awareness of situations where super religious people want to adopt for selfish reasons.
You weren’t a fuck up. You suffered a massive attachment trauma and developed a way to survive that no longer served you. You were operating from a place of primal fear of abandonment. Someone “saw” you and helped you heal with love . 💜
I'm curious what exactly they did that helped you, and what else they could have done to help you.
*godsend
🏆
🙌🙌🙌
Yes yes yes. All of this.  

Thank you so much for articulating this so clearly.
YOU GET IT!!
I was thinking more that there are financial incentives/fraud, access to vulnerable kids, etc
I shouldn’t have spoken in absolutes - there were a two kids who were sent to placement but the parents were charged with abandonment. Then they wanted the kids back, which was also frustrating, because do you really think that child’s behavior or emotional state was improved by their parents abandoning them and letting them sit in a hospital as strangers argued and tried to figure out what to do with them? It was awful. 

Child welfare is a big mess. I could never do CPS. You have no power and it’s basically voluntary to participate. And you see stories like this and worse all the time. 

But I can’t think of a single (poor) family I worked with who wouldn’t have had the hammer brought down on them for abandoning their kid at the hospital, let alone in a foreign fucking country. 

Bio parents would not get away with this, and poor parents sure as shit wouldn’t.
Yeah, unfortunately that’s been my experience too when filing as a mandated reporter. Having it be a “states rights” issue is a mistake to me.
No, I never was a CPS worker. I worked with children in medicine and then also in family court, so I just interacted with them a lot. But I definitely saw what you’re talking about.
You can Google a lot more about them, but in short they have a history of super shady adoptions wherein they use their version of white nationalist Christianity to harm birth parents and therefore also adoptees. 

One example is that they like taking referrals from “crisis pregnancy centers” that coerce minors into adoption because it’s god will or some other harmful bullshit. 

An example of them exerting shady pressure and circumventing parental input for pregnant minors is the adoption facilitated on the first season of Teen Mom with the teens Caitlyn and Tyler. It’s the reason Tyler had to hand over the newborn in a parking lot.

More recently, they have participated in “rehoming” minor children who were stolen from their families by the US government at the Mexican-US border.

They’ve rebranded as “Bethany” but for a longtime they were known as Bethany Christian Services.

ETA: Their HQ is in GR.
IF the christian god is even remotely real....these people are all going to hell WITHOUT question...

So there's gotta be two distinct types....ones that don't believe it at all and are using it to get away with "sin"....and the "true believers" who FULLY believe that they can do whatever they want as long as they believe in jesus.

Either way you're a shitty shitty person and a bad guy.
Wait. They are making him live with them?! I was hoping he was moved elsewhere 

Article closed out on me before I could fully finish reading. Gotta check the Ublock settings on chrome.
I think the point they're getting at is that this should be fucking illegal to snag up an adoptive kid, send them out to a "correctional" facility in Jamaica, then completely abandon them there. If that is legal in Michigan, then there is a big fucking oversight in our foster care system.

They're clearly not trying to belittle the people who actually do their jobs. You're letting your personal feelings get in the way of what's an obvious issue with the system itself, not the people working in it. This isn't about you, it's about fixing the bigger picture.

I also very much bet all of us are in agreement that it should be illegal to do what they did.
I grew up in the D but live in Oregon now. Lol
What religion, if I may ask?
Wdym selfish reasons if you wouldn’t mind embellishing.
There’s only one D, and the way you said it makes me doubt you mean here.
🙌
no, they said "you are god sent", not "you are a godsend" 

it works perfectly fine! but one could question whether "god sent" should be one word or not, i suppose 🤔
Good point. There was a family on our block that specialized in fostering kids, mostly pre-teens and teens along with their two natural kids. For years they received BIG MONEY from the county for this. They added on a two story addition in the back. Then one day a teenage girl got sexually assaulted and word got back to the county, resulting in the foster kids getting removed and investigation started.  After 25 years the foster family literally pulled up stakes and were gone overnight.
My experience is less fraud and more white/religious saviorism - both with the probability of leading to exploited kids. 

But I’ve never been in foster care. 

The kids surviving/who survived it can speak more to the prevalence of different motives and their impacts.

How much do you think the religious aspect plays into the "parents" getting away with this?
Yes.  And you're really lucky if the intake worker isn't beyond nasty (I mean, it's a horrible job) and tells you the kid deserved the (egregious, readily obvious) abuse.
That’s super fucked up. Thanks for taking the time to shine some light on them.
I used to work in foster care in West Michigan about 5 to 10 years ago and then later did work with GAL's. The whole system out there is abysmal. I saw many CPS workers lie under oath on the stand regularly and despite having solid proof they lied, the most that would happen is a slap on the wrist. The shady adoptions and policies of private foster care agencies was horrible as well and with West Michigan being so Christian, what angered me the most is the large amount of LBGT+ that couldn't adopt from any agency because they're ALL faith based. So loving homes were passed over and denied because the agencies "didn't agree with that lifestyle."
Someone once told me that in order to get into heaven, all you have to do is ask for forgiveness on your death bed. For example, Hitler got into heaven by simply asking God for forgiveness. That is why these people do horrible things on earth, because God will just forgive them if they ask nicely when they are dying.
Yup, they're making him live with them, at least so far. It's *horrible*.
You legally could send you birth child to a "correctional" program in Jamaica. It has nothing to do with adoption. Once you finalize an adoption, the child is legally your child. The state no longer has any involvement in it. Do you think the judges, attorneys, guardian ad litems, foster workers, adoption workers, CASA workers, etc. all have a magic crystal ball that lets them know which people will turn out to be assholes after they adopt kids? Do you think kids are better served staying in the system until they age out because some people who adopt kids turn out to be shitty parents?
Evangelicalism born again Christians. Just like the folks who did this
People praise people who adopt especially in religious communities. Call them saints, amazing people, get reminded "I never would be able to handle that".... it feeds quite a few people's egos. In other cases if they adopt in the states some states continue to comp for adopting from the foster care system.

Edit: and I forgot to add they get told they are "saving a soul" aka converting someone else to Christianity
Hahaha what? That's ridiculous I'm literally on the michigan subreddit and literally have a history of posting on the Detroit subreddit. Good one troll
*a* godsend then 😆
Do you live just north of Lansing? A _very_ similar thing happened here. Apparently there were two foster families kind of working together, covering for one another, doing the same things. Sickening.
I live two hours South of Traverse City in the  “bible belt” of Michigan. They’ve turned the North into an extension of that. The religious aspect of this has EVERYTHING to do with this. Insanely rich, Evangelical Christian, wanna-be Theocratics, have invaded the tourist towns of Northern Michigan (former Sec. of Education Betsy DeVos and gang have homes and their yacht in the area). They and their fellow cult members are doing everything they can to turn these areas into exclusive enclaves where most of what they do goes unscrutinized. They’re largely succeeding.
I don’t think it plays that much of a role. I saw parents of all races and religious  backgrounds get away with things they shouldn’t have. The opposite too - CPS hammering down on the wrong issue and being too quick to remove. It is a crapshoot. But if you’re wealthy and connected? You’re going to be in a lot better of a position.
 
It also makes me think of the case over the summer of the white parents, one of whom was a cop, took their infant on a boat during a heatwave of Arizona and left her to basically boil to death in the sun while they had some fun in the water and got to make a GoFundMe. Last I heard they were being investigated, but still; I think if they had been poor parents, allowing their infant to bake in the sun to death without protection while they splash in the pool, it would have gone down very differently for the parents. 

I think it also just boils down to children don’t really have rights in the United States. We’re the only country in the UN who has not ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. 

Parental rights to choose what “they think is best” for their kid supersedes kids’ rights to safety all the time. I saw it all the time when I worked at the children’s hospital. 

This article also adds to my opinion that child welfare and CPS laws, practices and agencies shouldn’t vary from state to state. It shouldn’t be up to the states to decide, because then parents will hop from jurisdiction from jurisdiction (things can even get extremely messy when a family hops counties within the state, let alone state to state). There’s this “influencer”family where they have several children and live in a bus, and they were clearly medically neglecting their poor newborn. People were calling, but if someone is going state to state it’s hard for CPS to do anything because they barely have any power in their own county. It being a “states rights” issue enables shitty and abusive parents (especially ones with means) to get away with doing whatever they want to their kids, and kids fall through the cracks.
They probably use their faith to justify being shitty people. Like most religious people.
Wow, that is even worse than I had feared. Thank you so much for speaking on this. Do you have any thoughts on how a random person like me can help build a system that actually cares for families and children?
That trick only works if you don't plan it. Do bad things with asking for forgiveness later in mind...boom...straight to hell!
Unreal.
You cannot abandon a child in a foreign country. You may be able to send your child there, but once the facility you sent them to is done with them they’re still your child. It is your responsibility to get your minor child back to the country they have citizenship in.
Ok thanks, this is more or less what I was thinking but didn’t know how I would put in words. I know a family that’s religious and has adopted 5 children.. dad has a good job and seems to be rarely at home.
You’re not from here originally, I’ll give you a break.
No. At the time I was living in California. We now reside elsewhere.
I moved back to Central MI after 12 years in Southern California and was SHOCKED at the abundance religious radio stations that are now present.  One of the first things I commented on when I got home.
I live up north (native, born here), and it absolutely creeps me out how ultra-conservative/gun-nutty/conspiracy-theorist people are becoming around here.  Especially those who move here to “get away from the BS” wherever they came from, and I am ashamed of the racist, homophobia, and xenophobic attitudes, and sheer damn bitchiness born out of entitlement I have seen directed at others.
>We’re the only country in the UN who has not ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. 

[Nor the Kyoto Protocol, the Rome Statute, or the Geneva Convention Protocols, among others.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_treaties_unsigned_or_unratified_by_the_United_States)
You’re absolutely right. They’re a “good, christian family”. Good meaning wealthy.
Right. Something about intentions. "I'll ask for forgiveness later even though I'm going to knowingly do a bunch of shitty things purposely" doesn't cut it. 

I've studied a lot of religions and most of them have that to close that stupid loophole 😂
I agree, and that is child abandonment, which is illegal. I think the parents should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. MDHHS would have no authority in this case until the minor returns to the state, at which point the Department could petition the court for removal of the minor from the home.
Yes, and somehow they all come in crystal clear, when even more local stations sometimes have static lol
Thank you for this - good reading for later!
I honestly cannot imagine jumping through all the elaborate hoops required to be an adoptive parent only to go, “oh, my bad. You are actually a challenge to parent, little buckareeno. This was a mistake. Can I get a do-over?”

We Pulled out over 200 electric scooters from the Red Cedar River 😡
The photos are all from separate days, the majority of these scooters we pulled out from Bouge street bridge. We pulled out a ridiculous amount of Spin Scooters from the river, which was a huge factor leading up to the ban of Spin in the area! 

Each scooter weighed probably close to 100 pounds and we pulled pulling 30-40 up each trip out. Over an hour drive each way to this spot and spin threatened to sue instead of reward. 

Spin filed for bankruptcy as of March of this year, more information on various articles about the scooters we pulled out of the Red Cedar River. What are your thoughts on e-Scooters and how can they be better implemented into the public to prevent issues like this?

Think about all the heavy metals that you and your crew are personally responsible for keeping out of our ecosystem and our wildlife. Thank you so much for your efforts.
Before reading the post I thought there were just a lot of dumb people accidentally dropping them into the river. But no of course it's much more sinister.


Thank you for helping clean the river of this junk!
That's a very Green activity to take care of the Red Cedar like that!
I'm confused as to what they tried to sue you for.  Seems like you're taking care of an illegal dumping site for them.
lol, think you found part of the reason they went broke. 

Thank you for doing this - go green!
1. Why do so many people throw them in the river?

2. How do these companies stay profitable if they are constantly having to buy new scooters?
Worst jetskis ever
*In the depths of the Red Cedar,*

*There's some bikes that are known to all*

*Their specialty is dumping*

*And the company's bound to fall*
Damn that's a lot of pollution - good on you guys for pulling it up
Good work highlighting this. All these on-demand scooter companies need to be banned. Having scooters just laying around all over sidewalks is a major nuisance in every city they're in.
Is this the river that goes through michigan state?

Awesome work!
I saw something here on Reddit last year about 15,000 bikes a year being pulled out of the canals in Amsterdam. 

I don't know how that relates to ebikes in Michigan, but I thought it was an interesting little bit of trivia.

WHO THE FUCK IS THROWING ALL THESE INTO WATER? Raise your kids better
[deleted]
Thank you for helping the environment and waterways, you are heroes! Spin needs to be investigated by the EPA.
[deleted]
I grew up on that river catching soft shells, painters, and red eared sliders! Thanks for your hard work!
Why in gods name would anyone throw an electric scooter into a river?  I don't buy the 'bored college student' answer... someone's got to be willfully evil to do that.  What a waste of resources.
Electric scooters are great. People suck.
Thank you for cleaning up our ecosystem as best as you're able to!! You're the best!
This is happening in so many major cities. I just don't understand human nature, why throw these into our water ways? Do you want swimmable waters with fish? Cuz this is how you don't get that!
This is sad, and people are trash. Thank you for caring enough to do the right thing when others cant be bothered enough to care not to. Also, the company Spin, should take a long hard look at themselves and go over the implications of suing someone over getting their crap out the river. They either they put them there or had very little accountability of their assets.
Thank you OP, this is literally doing the lords work. It makes me sick to think so many entitled brats are polluting are rivers this way.
IIRC one city found the life expectancy of an electric scooter was under two months. Not failures as such, mostly thrown in rivers and lakes.  Not really a viable business model.
Than you for performing this public service. Seriously, this is great work. 

I generally like the concept of e-scooters, at least on paper. Once you add humans to the mix, it falls apart. I don’t see how it is even a viable business model when so many are being dumped in the river. 

Spin can go right to hell for attempting to sue as far as I’m concerned.
These things were like a social expiriment or some shit lmao. We had these in Monroe for like a year or two before the exact same shit happened with people chucking them in the River Raisin
It's just too bad that there are so many idiots on campus that are so destructive and have absolutely no regard for other people's property. Grow the hell up people.
Do you get to keep them?
State needs to seize the company's assets to pay for disposal.
Wait until they start doing this with CyberTrucks.
The company that owns those needs to be prosecuted
You should see if you can get compensated from Bird for this.
its truly disgusting. those batteries can destabilize ecosystems within months if it’s enough
Probably the work of just a couple pricks….
Good job. That’s absolutely horrific that someone would want to trash the place they live so badly…. Makes no sense really. Just miserable and disrespectful people. Thanks for picking up after those scumbags.
talk to local prosecutor say all these were abandoned/dumped and have the prosecutor go after companies. prosecutor can lay fines against a company to come clean it up professionally.
unreal. some people are the worst. thank you for doing this!
How does that work where you live? Salvage law? You get to keep and sell for salvage? Any value in them, (beyond the awesome environmental benefits of removing them I mean)?
Don't you have to swipe a card or something to rent them? Can't the company track down who rented them last and charge them for the scooter?
200 is insane!
Was that the river roundup in Ann Arbor?  I did that once. It was amazing.
So electric scooter companies are just money laundering.  Got it.
This is why we can’t have nice things
I hate that people think this is a helpful way to fight against the corporatization of our transportation and recreational activities. Thank you so much for pulling those out of the river as throwing them in the river only hurts people. I just wish those scooters weren't so expensive and I wish they were more accessible to the public. I'm too poor to ever use those scooters.
I never understood the scooters till I went to Germany,  they are awesome and its a shame they get wasted like this..
Appreciate you cleaning up after college kids. They can be dicks sadly.
I think the problem with the scooters is that they're marketed as having little or zero maintenance costs associated with the municipality or school they're contracting with. Unfortunately, everything has a maintenance cost. Maybe tracking devices with staff dedicated to retrieving them and cleaning them? Honestly outright banning these lithium battery menaces might be a good idea. They don't instantly make your town better, they don't do the heavy lifting to make your downtown more attractive. Either you have accessability and transportation or you don't.
Thank you.
So that’s what spin did with their scooters after losing to lime
People suck. Things like this are supposed to reduce polution but just end up part of the problem.
try grand rapids next! I'm sure there's a few in there
You earned a trip to the tipi if it's still out there
Time for a whistle blower to come forward.
Great job!

People like you doing projects like this is why we can have nice things.
Try Bay City next, I used to live real close to downtown area and those bikes were everywhere
How do these companies make any money? I'll watch a magnet fishing  video from anywhere  in the world, and  they'll be pulling these scooters out.
thank you!
Thank you for your service. A GoFundMe could probably net you some operation expenses.
Jesus!
Link to the magnet?
I can't imagine why they went bankrupt.
Fucked
The e scooters are finally out where it live, but they are restricting you from being able to ride them close to the river, probably so people stop throwing them in, it just sucks there's a huge river right through the middle of town and I partially would rent them to cross it, we'll see what happens I guess
Fuck e-scooters
How and why did these all end up in the water, did I miss that part of the story?
I’m genuinely always surprised that these have stuck around. As often as I see them being pulled out of rivers and stuff you’d think cities would just say fuck this and stop buying more and give up trying.

I’m glad they’re still available n all that. But damn the amount that are just thrown in rivers is depressing.
Thank you!!!
It seems like webcams at the bridges would be a good start.
Whoever threw those in the river should be immediately sent to the gulag 🥰
What dumb people throw them in?
Looks like they uncovered some insurance fraud to me. No way 200 scooters went in at almost same spot. Companies were not making enough money renting them out so yeet into river get money back now and bankrupt or dissolve Corp and money is doubled in short time.
Let's throw out a couple more contracts to this vital industry
I mean this begs the question.... did that company purposefully and illegally dispose of those scooters? And in what other waterways?
So it was Spin themselves throwing them in the river? For insurance claims?
I seriously wonder why it's socially acceptable for vandals to throw expensive private property that doesn't belong to them in a river, but then the owner of that property is to blame for littering. Makes no sense, unless you hate the scooters because you don't like to see other people having mobility or fun.

The answer is for the drunk spoiled brats who do stuff like this to shared bikes and scooters (and public bathrooms and hotel rooms, and the upholstery of uber ride back seats, etc) to get a misdemeanor/fine.

If you think the scooters are a nuisance, that does not mean you have a reason to vandalize or dump them. If your neighbor owned a big lifted pickup truck, does that give you an acceptable and legal right to slash their tires?

Do you have evidence that the company which owned the scooters was dumping them illegally? If you accused them of that knowing that this was false and did so in a highly public manner then yes wouldn't that be defamation? Maybe the OP should get sued.

Am I the lone crazy person or is this entire thread is unreasonable?
Where is this at? I have some e scooters that need a good river to be tossed in.

All jokes aside, you're doing great work. Those e scooters are a pox upon city life and they deserve to be destroyed.
Hmmm! Get drunk and throw scooters in river one night then protest for climate change action the next night.  Yup, sounds like a typical college city.
What did you do with all of them after pulling them out?
Drop them off at the company that left them there.
[removed]
Our species is worst.
Do the scooters work?
People clearly hate these things. Can we just get rid of them already?
You could probably get some money for all those batteries.
Sounds like there is far less learning, and an obtuse amount of ignorance and stupidity among students these days. Sad for America, sad for the world. I have been, and you are now witnessing the demise of our society and way of life as we know it. This is all part of a greater plan for the down fall of the west. And it starts with the degradation of our youth. make them stupid, weak and ignorent. Then take away their constitutional rights... Along with guns, (also a constitutional right). So they cant fight back. Give em a bunker to run to...yaa that will work... Then invade. Or squash their tech, send them back to the 1800's. they will then be defeated. Then invade... But mark these words in your mostly empty heads. We are on our way out and there is nothing you or I can do. Millions of "scooters" in all the rivers near collegiate campuses. Chew on that! Mic Drop! but I will more than likely be censored. No more truth in this country either! And you most likely wont get a reply from me...I just simply am not beholden to the monster... Don't know why I responded to this. Out of all the madness to respond to.... Sad! Truly an embarrassment!
lol classic
Send them a bill for gas and hours spent recovering.
How much government money did this company receive? What a joke.
Thank you!!!!
Sparty on!
Great. Now take them to the dump. Fuck those things.
I love the spring scooter hatching
Wasn't this already posted? Pretty sure I remember this exact post about scooters from the red cedar a few weeks ago
Why do the scooters in each picture look the same? Why is there that single one with a clear bright clean orange stick in every one of them? Is it coincidence or significant for some reason? 

I haven't really been paying attention to the scooter saga. Is there an news article that has a good summary?
200!?!?  How were there so many?!
Do we even have Red Cedars in Michigan?
Thanks for doing it
My 88 spree should be there
Y'all are awesome people!
Dude you're my hero
Sad.
After you pull those scooters then what they would do with those scooters??
Honestly take away scooters around that area, that’s ridiculous how many were in the river.
Ugh, I mean this is the issue. There’s too many factors. You would think common sense would stop people but wtf is the point of throwing a Perfectly fine working scooter into a river? Maybe spin should have made a better tracking system. Idk a small groups fault results on everyone in the community it’s tuff but what can you do.
🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
“zero emission” vehicles, cheaper to throw them in a river then recycle those power packs. Teslas, Leafs, Bolts will surface next.
Awesome, there’s 100 more at least waiting to be found in the Huron river!
so that’s where the spin scooters went
How the fuck did hundreds of scooters end up in the river in the first place?
You and your boyfriend seem to be doing hard work.
Come to UCF
College kids; climate change is the most important issue today. Also college kids; wanna yeet batteries into the water system
 I lived in Austin, Texas when these scooters came out. I remember watching some drunk tech bro zig zagging on a lime scooter get bodied by a Tacoma and dragged 25 feet after he ran the light on 4th and Colorado. People liked throwing them in Lady Bird Lake. When I moved back to Michigan I must say I’m happy I haven’t seen one here, at least not where I live.
Ok but why do people just dump scooters in rivers??  This is a problem in France, too
Red Cedar river near where?
People just have no respect for things that don't belong to them. I'm sure most of these were thrown in on purpose by People 
I think Escooters are a good thing, unfortunately especially in the US people suck.
Probably when all those butthole MICHIGAN fans came here
I told them, I did, these scooters are a bad idea, mark my words.  Yes sirree.
What kind of idiot does this?
If you want to see much more waste checkout the overhead photos and videos of ebike graveyards in China on YouTube.

Burning couches. Now this.
Ugh, electric vehicles are going to be an environmental disaster.
I was once a student at MSU doing stupid shit
Good, now they'll end back in the river in less than a week
Should have left them
[removed]
That's awesome! Now put them back!
How many guns did you find this time?
I'm gonna toss em in there faster than you can fish them out
You magnet people cause more problems than help.  What does pulling all of the junk out of a body of water and wasting township and city resources accomplish?  Clicks and views?  "Hey, we found a gun that might be a murder weapon!!!", while it's a muddy chunk of rusty steel that zero forensics could be pulled from.  Well, thanks for calling the police over this...
the company should be fined.
you have an entire lake to dilute that stuff into, but the electric eels need feeding here and now
Electric bikes don’t normally have any heavy metals
No problem, cleaning the waters one throw at a time
Sinister? I was a student around this time and everyone was just getting drunk and throwing these things in the river for fun. You would walk across the bridge and see all the blinking lights.
I would magnet fish more of the Red Cedar River but it's like 1:20 from me. Doing almost 3 hours worth of driving each trip out there
They threatened under "defamation" (never would've made it to court anyways) because they didn't like me posting pictures of what we were pulling out of the river (their own product) and they didn't like it being all over the news. Never said anything bad about them during that time. They never offered a reward or a helping hand in the clean up effort. They also broke multiple contract points with the city and campus.
Holy shit.  That would be fucking villainous.  If that's the case, I hope they all go to prison.
Those things pay for themselves after like a week or two IIRC
They don't buy new scooters, they claim the missing ones for many times more than the scooters are worth through insurance
The main culprit Spin didn’t manage to stay profitable (I think I read recently that almost no scooter companies are currently) they have filed for bankruptcy and are banned from East Lansing thanks to their apparent [fraud/negligence](https://www.wilx.com/2024/03/06/electric-scooter-company-banned-east-lansing/)

1. Drunk college kids.

2. The companies are not profitable because of vandalism like this

They were a good idea on the surface but nobody seemed to factor in basic human shittiness.  It's like those bike repair stations towns and parks put up - yeah they're handy until someone steals the tools and breaks them 20 minutes after they get installed.
Works quite well in my city, but mainly because scooters are allowed to use the infrastructure for bikes like bike lanes.

Also in higher frequented areas, scooters are only allowed to park in designated areas, otherwise the scooter company fines you.
And cars parked on the sidewalk and in bike lanes are any different?

At least scooters don't kill anyone.
Yeah, red cedar connects to the Grand River, or well branches from it

I don’t think the business did it. Students threw them in the river most likely
I did also get an injury while pulling one of their scooters up too, had the brake handle jabbed into my arm to the bone, but Spin is no longer a company, went bankrupt and sold out
What a wonderful comment. :) Your gratitude puts you on our list for the most grateful users this week on Reddit! You can view the full list on r/TheGratitudeBot.
Drunk college kids will absolutely throw e scooters in, kinda like a game to then, who can throw them the furthest, heard too many stories about what locals have seen after we discovered all these scooters in the water.
when I was a student at MSU someone ripped out a tree I had growing in a pot on my back porch. it happened on a tuesday night during the summer but pretty sure it was a drunk college kid :/
The company threw them in when they started going under. Probably got a bunch of insurance money.
It's called destructive nature, people love to destroy stuff, just the destroy stuff. They don't care about anything but themselves
Nope, out of over 200 we weren't even allowed to keep one, I asked the company that owns them too.
I'm a pretty hardcore Libertarian, gov shouldn't do anything because it can't be trusted with power type, but I'm on board with you. Preventative measures and quick recovery.
They won't even if I tried
No it's illegal to keep them because they're privately owned. As of March they can legally be scrapped but not kept
No because the person who last rented the scooter likely isn't the one who threw it in
That's just from ONE small bridge too....
I'm from Grand rapids, only found like 4 over the last 7 years of fishing gr
I would but that's well over 3 hours from me, might do it when I decide to travel to Detroit though, any specific spots you'd recommend
They claim insurance off the scooters like multiple times more than what the scooters are worth. That's how they make money
https://kratosmagnetics.com/discount/DULOW12

That's the website I use for magnet and gear
That we can only guess, most likely drunk college kids
It seems likely, given that they threatened to sue OP for pulling them out of the river.
They do not deserve to be destroyed by immature people. There are far more civil ways to deal with shit like this. You have no idea how much of a struggle it was to clean that many out of the river and how dangerous it can be when lithium batteries get wet.

Appreciate it though.
Called the company so they could pick up their "vehicles" that we pulled out of the river. Since March of 2024, spin scooters can legally be brought into scrap yards now (may require proof on how you obtained them, but most scrap yards know who I am and what I do)
How? No vehicle is big enough to haul 40+ e scooters without renting a u haul. They ended up picking them up in 3 different trucks 😂
Removed. See rule #2 in the [r/Michigan subreddit rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Michigan/wiki/index#wiki_rules).
Illegal to keep
You probably saw it on the magnet fishing sub reddit like a month ago, I haven't posted it on the Michigan subreddit about it until this post. Maybe someone cross posted it from the magnet fishing subreddit to here?
Because the majority of the ones that were being dumped were Spin scooters, they are privately owned by a company, not owned by individual people.
Drunk college kids if I had to guess, it's up to almost 230 e scooters we pulled out to be exact
I think we do in the UP, but don't quote me, I don't know much about trees lol but we definitely have a Red Cedar River lol
Um that's my dad...
It's not a bad idea, it's just very poorly planned.
Likely the drunk kind. It almost certainly wasn't just one person
No Michigan state
*The illegal or irresponsible disposal of electric vehicles
Well if people throw 200 cars in the river, maybe, but it will take centuries to catch up with the environmental damage from toxic chemicals and leaded gas that ICE vehicles have gifted us with.
A bit less than petrol powered cars though.
How they gonna end back up in the river when they are removed from the premise
Removed. See rule #2 in the [r/Michigan subreddit rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Michigan/wiki/index#wiki_rules).
What does guns gotta do with e scooters?
Cry about it, no we don't. Maybe don't throw weapons in the water and you wouldn't need to worry.
Did Spin put the scooters in the river?
Why?  It's not the company dumping these into the river. In a lot of cases the same jackasses who park their gas cars at EV chargers chuck these in rivers, dumpsters, etc.  Part of why companies like spin failed was blatant sabotage.
That’s why I always throw a couple batteries into my local river as a treat.
Wait a minute…the electric eels all live in the ocean: do you work for AutoZone or something?! Look, you can’t stop me from throwing my used car batteries into the ocean! It’s safe and legal thrills!! You and your AutoZone cronies can buzz off.

If someone were to want to try magnet fishing, what apparatus would they need to start?
One of the scooter companies ended up being banned from Lansing thanks to these recovery efforts. It turned out that they were making no moves to retrieve scooters from the river and bridge, which routinely caused scooters to be pushed off the bridge to clear it.
This seems more like a dumping ground for the company imo
Is that not more sinister than accidentally driving it into the river?
Yes... That's sinister Palllll
Tell me you are a Sparty without telling me
Thank you for doing something so awesome and making our water healthier.  Spin should have been fined for every one of these dumped in waterways.  Jerks.
By threatening to sue, it implies that Spin was dumping scooters in the river themselves. Which nobody would assume if they hadn't said anything.
AHH, the truth! Our only weakness!
All that makes me think is that they were illegally dumping them. I didn't even think about that until you said they tried to sue you. Guess they're just telling on themselves. Lol.
"I don't need an agenda, I just tell the truth"

  
You rock!!!
Well, I had some stupid ideas they might sue over in mind before I read your comment, there, but that out-stupids everything I thought of.

(Uh-oh! I might be defaming them myself by calling their lawsuit stupid!)
Lol, the best defense of a defamation charge is the truth
Do you have any updates to this? Did Spin successfully sue? Are you still pulling them out of the river? Just curious! And great work, fellas!
they probably had an insurance or tax write off for lost, vs selling for salvage/scrap. that might not work out in the long run...
Damn, that's kinda sad. We pay them to continue this cycle. 


Regardless, thank you for getting them out of the rivers.


Have watched several YouTube videos of magnet fishing, it looks like a lot of fun.
Are insurance companies unaware of this?
hell yeah, I'm glad the state is starting to act against these companies that straight up leech on our cities.
Thanks for the laugh. Just spit out my coffee.
To be a good idea on the surface they would have needed dedicated parking stations like city bike rentals have and if the scooter isn't returned to a designated parking station the last user gets charged something like $100. That would have solved the problem of them being left everywhere they aren't supposed to be. It also would have greatly reduced the number of people who wanted to use them because they are no longer convenient, much like the city bike rentals. 

Also need to educate people that they aren't for use on sidewalks just like bikes aren't. Sidewalks are for walking, scooters belong on the road, in bike lanes, or mixed used paths, just like bikes.
Cars get fined for that or even towed.
Gotcha thanks!
These things are generally GPS tracked so they can be recovered for charging/battery swapping.  225+ scooters going offline or missing on the edge of a bridge should have prompted a recovery effort.  But, from the sounds of it, they're too busy threatening to sue people and going turbo broke.
Can confirm, I went to MSU when bird scooters were around. People got drunk and threw them in the river. Never understood why, but it happened.

Definitely - drunk/annoyed/bored/stupid students were to blame.
make sure to get a tetanus shot if haven't already.

That's frightening. Thank you for continuing this work despite your injury. I hope it healed well.
Good bot
What shitty people.  Their parents didn't do a good job raising them.
That's wild. Did they at least pay you for your work removing them?
Put pressure on them then. Get interviews, make noisy but as peaceful as possible protests, etc.
Ah. I just hope you aren't getting stuck with cost of disposal for fishing them out. You just call the company and let them know where to pick them up?
Which bridge? That’s wild! Is that the Hagadorn bridge?
really!? that's actually really good news, thanks for your service, you're appreciated more than you know!
Hmm.... Washington Avenue, basically the main Street downtown, I did see an article about scooters being taken, but now I can't find it!
Well that's way worse than what I was thinking, drunk college kids tossing them over..
And even if it wasn't, they made everybody think that by threatening to sue
The trouble is that this can be an act of civil disobedience because the complaints about these dreadful companies fall on deaf ears, so people take matters into their own hands and trash the scooters. Not the best way to get rid of them, but it is the simplest for most people.
I'm still gonna toss em in the river, you literally cannot stop me. The scooters YEARN FOR THE RIVER
so its finders keepers with spin scooters now?
I honestly am surprised they came and got them.  The amount of lithium there has to make disposing of them a nightmare.
Ah must have been that
Thanks, I got that part. I don't know anything about electric scooters really, so maybe it's just something obvious I am overlooking or don't know how to ask the right question. The clean bright orange stick on a single scooter in every picture stands out to me. I'm just wondering what the significance of it is or if it was just random coincidence.
I am aghast at their behavior. But so glad about you and your crew doing this.
Thanks for all your work in getting this stuff out of the rivers!
How could you prevent this, though, short of insisting that everyone return their scooters to secured facilities when done with them?
Yep
and mining of raw materials, processing, all the plastic required, when they set on fire, leaking, etc.
They'll find a way. City scooters always end up dumped no matter how much you retrieve them.
[removed]
Yeah just leave all those lithium ion batteries down there, what could go wrong?
Worry about what?  People like you pissing away taxpayer funds?  Watch all of the magnet fishing videos on YouTube.  It's full of people calling emergency services for no reason.  Hence, pissing away tax money.
This is why we can’t have nice things. 😏
Yes
If they're threatening to sue over someone dredging their product up from the river-- they might have helped contribute to the scooters ending up there.
probably, the insurance company cried fraud
SOMEBODY’S GOTTA CHARGE THE EELS GRU!
Okay? But why do you need to? Why can’t you just dispose of it correctly…. Respectfully…. Instead of making the earth a worser place than when you found it. I’m sure you are a great role model for any youngsters in your life.🤡
There is no cadmium lead or mercury in lithium ion
Batteries you’re just spreading FUD
Magnet, rope, gloves, and a 5 gallon bucket.
Good 👍 🦸‍♂️
I think it could be considered a dumping ground in the sense that the company is aware that everyone is throwing these scooters in the river, and doing nothing to recover them. Which is definitely wrong. I don’t think the company is paying employees to dump them in themselves though. It was definitely a trend to get fucked up and huck one in there.
This is a highly trafficked bridge in the middle of MSU’s campus. If a company is dumping hundreds of scooters someone is going to notice.
It turned out it was. The main culprit is banned from operating in Lansing now due to their bad faith practices.
You greatly underestimate the destruction that drunk people can and will do.
Why?
They were fined by East Lansing for breaking multiple ordinances and contract points
Which should have been rolled to the customer.
Damn, we should fine McDonald’s for every Big Mac container thrown on the highway also. 

Mostly kidding, I see what you’re saying, but I’m sure the company didn’t want thousands of dollars worth of scooters thrown into a river.
It’s not really Spin’s fault. If you want to blame someone, blame asshole college kids
Suing a bankrupt company *eagle screeches in the sky*
This exactly, when I first saw him pulling the scooters I thought wow what a nice guy. After hearing that they were threatening to sue I immediately thought they dumped the scooters for insurance claim on a failing company or something. It's amazing how stupid so many companies are, and even more amazing that people keep giving companies like that money..
I absolutely would assume that. 

1, maybe even 10, in the river - that’s an asshole teenager. 

100+ is industrial dumping to avoid proper disposal.

The threat just confirms it.
Which may be entirely true, but filing a lawsuit would never be interpreted as an admission of guilt, and they clearly don’t care about their brand image. I’d guess it’s just the private equity firm sweeping up the rubble trying to make a few bucks.
Net necessarily. From what I've heard a lot of the contracts require that the companies make an effort to recover and properly dispose of their scooters. This just shows that they're not even trying
No! Not honesty!
I read that in a Simpsons-esque villain character’s voice haha
This was a year ago they threatened to sue, if they did try it never made it through 😂 

Still pulling them out at random. Pulled out another 50 this year.
It is fun, but very occasionally you get some very unexpected discoveries like this one. It's back breaking work lol
If they aren't the State of Michigan is likely to get involved. This sounds like insurance fraud to me.
On the campus of Michigan state University students are encouraged to use the sidewalks (my daughter went there and they were encouraged to do so for safety reasons). However in the state of Michigan the law for scooters and bikes also encourages them to use the sidewalks when available but they must yield to pedestrians and use proper hand signals.
Maybe we should push them into the river.
It's definitely odd because some of the active spin scooters(ones that were NOT in the water) that we gave the gps codes to the person we called said they could not track exactly where we were at, couldn't get the GPS off any of them
Same reason they would steal my bike seat, tires, deface murals, etc. A lot of college kids are extremely immature and entitled.
As a former drunk MSU student, I tried to throw a construction sign into the river off that very same bridge to appease the River God. Thankfully I failed as I had to ditch the sign and run when a cop pulled over.

TLDR: drunk college kids are dumb
Nah, it was a huge issue when I lived in Oakland (Ca) too. Between "fuck this corporation!" and "Hur Hur good luck picking it up in the middle of the lake" it happened *a lot*. This is not an isolated phenomenon, and putting a high volume and concentration of young adults who are much more likely to feel "Hur Hur" or " Fuck corporations!" in one area definitely increases the chances.
Have you met drunk college students before?

Them collectively throwing 200 scooters in the river, over the course of several months, because they think it's funny is far more believable than your insurance fraud theory.
Nah this many screams corporate dumping. College students have better things to do
Corporate trashers trying to cover their dumping I see.
Yeah they may have gone out of business but somebody owns the IP.
Right, it's not even something that would cross most peoples mind when drinking. Ignorant people gonna ignorant
Nope they never even offered a reward, threatened to sue instead
Yeah but the company we found all the scooters of is bankrupting is no longer a company it dissolved and got bought out
Nope, I was not forced to pay any disposal cost, The company that own the scooters picked them up.
Bouge street in East Lansing
I mostly magnet fish to find old relics or historical items, I never planned or expected to pull that many scooters out, didn't know about them until we started pulling em out lol. Would've been nice to keep that and scrap em, would've definitely paid for the gas and equipment used.
Until you get caught by PD (They are cracking down hard on people for that right now)
Which makes me wish there was a chain of custody proof for the company now. How do we know the lithium was disposed of properly after leaving OP's hands?
Well Spin wasn't tracking their equipment and didn't try any attempts at recovery on equipment and just claimed the insurance from the missing scooters. We didn't find nearly as many Lime or Bird because they track their stuff down when it is inactive for a few days and pick it up
Wouldn't call it much of a crew, it was just 2 of us for the most part, some people later joined in on the effort back we already had around 150 when they joined in. I'm only counting the amount my dad and I pulled out.
Well first off they could put checkpoints on where scooters must be dropped off before you can hit finish. Needs to be within a certain radius of said check point. People could also submit new checkpoints. It's not very hard, just very time consuming and requires upkeep, which should be done in the first place. There should be a checkpoint rather than just dump it wherever.
Oh, *now* you care about the environment.  You still need to mine and process all the materials and fuel required to run ICE vehicles.
Odd how wrong you are, cuz last time I went to East Lansing, didn't find a single e scooter in the river, and I hit all the hot spots we kept finding em and spots I haven't hit.
It's already on YouTube and other platforms, just know they aren't the only ones armed 😂

This was clear sarcasm. It’s unfortunate we have to label it sometimes.
How many Spin scooters can you fit in the bucket before you have to dump it off the other side of the bridge to empty it out for the next ones?
What's a good magnet for someone just starting out??
We did this shit at IU too. Seems like a common occurrence on college campuses
Sounds par for the course with MSU
You mean like pulling up 200+ scooters and having 80-90% be from this one single company...
*Fine, then. We'll operate in the river!*
Haha, I worked for a small structural steel and ornamental iron company in East Lansing. Every Monday we would get calls to come out and weld the handrails back on at Farm Village after the weekend.
Who picks them up and disposes of them after you pull them out?
The problem is their business model calculated not bothering to look for and retrieve them was cheaper than buying replacements.  I think the best thing we could have done was written a state law or new ordinances for heavy fines based on every spin device found in our waterways.  This way it incentivizes them to keep better track, and have a better recovery system in place.
The problems I see is that all these scooters are geo tagged and it wasn’t any of their costumers who tossed these in the river.

The company can very plainly see that signal was lost near a body of water. As the owners of the vehicles, with data that points to their scooters being in the water it should absolutely be their responsibility to at least confirm if the scooters are in the water. 

I’d want to see three things for rental scooters to continue. 

Stereoscopic camera that starts filming when the scooter detects the wheels have left the ground with no active rider, it’s the only way to prove a specific person picked the thing up. 

They should be required to publish the serial numbers of scooters lost in or nearby bodies of water. 

They should also be required to pay a bounty on high risk scoots. If one happened to lose power and get left close enough to look like it was lost in the river, it’s a high enough risk to pay to remove. 

The bounty is where they could catch some people, as the types of people to damage the scooters are totally some of the same types of people that would fraudulently break them to claim a bounty. 

The bounty account would require access to your location services. Anyone who was at the same location at the same time as a scooter going in the water can be cross referenced to the scooter camera. 

Shame we can’t just have nice things
They should have a mitigation strategy.  People will always be assholes.  Doesn't mean you shred any responsibility for polluting our waterways.  For them, it's just a business write-off.  They don't care.  For us, it's a toxic dump in our rivers, lakes, and streams.
A few scooters could be college kids, TWO HUNDRED scooters in the same river seems a lot more like insurance fraud to me.
Spin knows where they are located.
A dozen scooters? Maybe.

200? I smell insurance fraud.
Considering they're not in bankruptcy anymore.  Yes, definitely.

The yield to pedestrians part is the crux of the issue. In my experience 95% of cyclist and 100% of scooter riders don't do that.
Not trying to defend the company, but GPS doesn't work under water and especially if there is a large concrete bridge. But still, after a dozen scooters disappear near the same spot someone should do something

Edit: can't read. Lol
GPS won't go through water, but if they were keeping track of the last reported location I feel like it should have shown up.
I did not like the idea of camera everywhere like in the UK until I saw officer camera catching bad officers or proving guilt of offenders.  I also like idea of camera catching property damage like scooters thrown into a river.  A local club I below too that is a not for profit and is run by the members has property damage from time to time due to members violating the rules.  They too are adding cameras.  

I just assume I may be on video anytime I am in public.  If college kids thought their activities were monitored and would face repercussions, I wonder if they would act better.  If not, at least send them back home to mommy and daddy until they learn to act like responsible adults.
That never happened, go tell the corporate trashers you tried to cover for them and get paid.
I agree that dumb people do dumb things and drunk people are dumb. The thing that points to corporate fuckery is that the company tried to sue the dude for posting how he was cleaning up the river.

Oh you mean after the company paid them to do it.
Yeah, a company that's out of business is buying accounts older than yours just to post on r/Michigan the exact day it's needed. I mean I lean towards the idea that it's corporate dumping but you immediately jump to the everyone who disagrees with you is being paid theory, which is insane.
No good deed goes unpunished!
Someone still owns the liability.

Yes, the one scooter that stands out to me in these pictures does say "spin" on it. It looks like you have the same set of roughly 30 scooters and just positioned them differently and took different pictures that you say are from different days. It set off my bs detector and I was hoping there was an explanation for it, as it seems many other readers took the post at face value.

Finding 30 would still be significant, so it didn't seem there was any reason for dishonesty, which is why I wondered if I was missing something or misunderstood.
It seems like people who didn't rent the scooters took parked scooters and threw them in the river.


I don't think anyone who paid to use the scooter would throw it in a river during a ride connected to their credit card.

edit to add: you'd think that there would be surveillance of some kind at the checkpoint. If new checkpoints can be added by anybody I can see how that would get out of hand.
I'm not saying ICE is better, but they are both bad.
Not my experience, always saw at least 3 or 4 perputally in the river in any big city.

They do it in Portland, OR too. Pretty much anywhere scooters are
The company that owns them, but it seemingly takes forever for them to show up
That would raise the cost to be economically unfeasible. To do that in safe, low risk way as typical of how a business would need to in the real world, you'd have to pay hundreds of dollars an hour for certified, insured scuba divers to get them out of a body of water.

Also more importantly we don't treat other industries like this. Again, do you fine McDonalds for every piece of McDonalds packaging found as litter? Or do we fine people who litter?

>They should also be required to pay a bounty on high risk scoots. If one happened to lose power and get left close enough to look like it was lost in the river, it’s a high enough risk to pay to remove. 

What is your strategy to prevent people from throwing scooters in the water, then coming back to get them to claim the bounty?
I thought it was already found out in other places that it was some sort of fraud.  I can't seem to find any articles in my 1 min of searching.
You are seriously underestimating drunk MSU students with easy access to a river. Not to mention, those things were like gnats on campus, everywhere. I've fought the urge many times to chuck those goddamn things in the river myself.
I mentioned they tried to track scooters that were never in the water that happened to be parked nearby, that's the ones we gave the gps number to the company to try and track the location
Obviously every student who tossed it over the bridge was smart enough to disable the GPS blocks earlier, there's no way the company could have known! /s
No.

I mean drunken college students get done using them to get where they want to be, and then think it's hilarious to chuck it into the river.

They hire drones out cause it's not hard to find mindless idiots that will do anything for a few bucks.
I know right, threatened to get arrested if I kept pulling firearms out of the river and reporting them over to the police. Like how am I supposed to control what I find with a magnet.
Lol
No these were all different days, We pulled out 30 on day one, 45 the second day, 50 the third day, then 26 the 4th day, After that, we'd find a dozen of them scattered about each trip. The Grand majority of them were all found off the same bridge, literally news articles online if you want to look at them, red cedar river scooters on Google and go to news section
I have zero reason to lie about so many scooter being pulled out, especially since there's factual evidence behind it if you do 5 minutes of research online. I also have video documentation lol
[removed]
Look around, raising costs has less than zero effect on feasibility.
Still pushing that same crap. We know what happened.
Where do I get paid?
I didn't accuse you of lying. I even stated that I saw no reason for you to be dishonest. I merely asked for an explanation of the discrepancy and a link to a news article.

After a few replies you have done neither. Claims of "evidence" and do your own research doesn't help your case any. I went from wondering what was the significance of the single scooter, to where I am now, where I do actually suspect you are lying. LoL back at ya. Deflect, deny, what's the next step?

Congratulations Detroit Lions!
First 6–1 start since 1956
52 to 14?!?!?!
I hope this convinces some of the people that were so worried about losing this game. 
The Lions PTSD is real, but so is this team, man. This is the best Lions team we’ve ever seen, from owner to waterboy. It’s a long road to the Super Bowl, but I’m not afraid of it. Bring that shit on.
[deleted]
As a lifelong browns fan, it's great to see the lions kicking ass. Super happy for this team.
Just watched some of the highlights... The number of times they scored without a player being touched... I could have scored those.
RESTORE THE ROAR!!!
This is a sign of the end times.
Adrian, MI is proud this day.
Im not a native Michigander. I moved here more than 10 years ago and grew up rooting for the giants. I’ve never really paid the lions any mind. These last two have turned me into a fan. Love the energy around this team!
Dan Campbell is the man!! Changed our organization for sure.
Great stuff.
Detroit is on a revenge tour
Every lion has it's day.
Super excited to see my packers (I’m a Yooper) take on the lions in Lambeau in person next week. Legit NFC Championship preview!
Brad better be cooking!
They'll fuck it up. It's the Ford curse.
This is the part where they get our hopes up and then *grind the bones of our enthusiasm into the ground*.
Just a bit of a massacre.
Looked like Tennessee team were mostly high school boys.
To be fair, the team they were facing was 1-5.
Super fun to see a real “next man up” attitude actually working.
I kept laughing at every turnover or big run… I just… don’t know what to do with myself now that the Lions are playing so well.
If they make it they're going to have to handcuff Hutchinson to his wheel chair and lock the door to keep him off that field, lol
As a Pats fan I'm rooting for you guys to put a stop to KC and be the heroes we need you to be.
Like I was telling my friend while we were watching the game, it feels weird being one of the best teams lol
I saw the end of the Packers game. I wasn’t happy they won.

Hopefully, it’ll be like the Vikings game and they get brought down a notch.
Yea, looking forward to that one too. The whole NFC is just a thunderdome right now and it's good to be on the top!

Beating the teams they need to in important games always seemed to be the Lions biggest shortcomings in the past. It's great to finally see them execute and win when they really need to.
Packers barely squeaked a win against a 2-5 Jaguars. It'll be a fight but we're certainly favored to win.
So how do I show up for both teams? A blue cheese head?
They aren’t even a good team. They’re scraping by shit teams.
Feels good man. The decades of mediocrity or worse are finally paying off. 2008 is a distant memory.
congrats on the ravens win tbh. i yelped!
I hope they make it to the Super Bowl this season

Super Bowl is going to be in New Orleans during Mardi Gras
Reminds me of the 2002 Wings. Damn near the whole team ended up in the HOF. *I* could have played a few shifts and they'd have been fine and I can't even skate that well.

Hopefully the same will be true for this years Lions!
Michigan Wolverines college football is incredible also
November 3 and December 5 are both Lions vs Packers

The December 5th game will be on Amazon Prime Video
Tell me you haven't watched the Lions in the last three years without telling me you haven't watched the Lions in the last three years.
Not anymore!
Same Old Lions died with Matt Patricia.
SOL never would have gone to Green Bay in the last game of the season and knocked them out of the playoffs in a game where they had nothing to gain. That’s the day I knew SOL was gone. I don’t even consider myself a Lions fan anymore.
Look at the team stats
at halftime i was like 'is someone going to stop them? is is okay to watch this?' genuine concern for TN.
With the number 1 defense to this point.
Yeah, but it's still a bit of cognitive dissonance
I watched the whole packers game. I am not afraid
I think that’s just being a Packers fan.
I hope they break last year's record noise level as well.
Oh shit, yea you're right. Man that would be one helluva time to win the Superbowl.
No. Go green.
If one team can sweep those, have to think they will win the division. Must watch and must win for all of us in Michigan and Wisconsin
The name that should never be spoken.
Look at the special teams and turnovers. Was a total team effort in the ass kicking
Hard to give up big yards when the opponents average starting position is the red zone.
Only because we handled Minnesota, and yeah that was by yards - they were like 21st for scoring defense.  Now they're 29th.  Still 1st by yards ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
go white!
Yup -- great game!
Satanic Invocation at Ottawa County
The Satanic Temple-West Michigan is proud to announce that our Ministry has been selected to give an opening invocation at the Ottawa County Commission. We are excited to represent our growing community by taking part in the tradition of invocation.
Hey, religious types, if you could stop reporting this thread for made up reasons, that would be greaaaat.
I’m sure the fine people of Ottawa County will be Completely Normal™️ about this.
I'm sure the right wing "free speech absolutists" will be glad to see this.
I'm a practicing Catholic and adore the Satanic Temple. Anyone frightened by them doesn't understand that they are an atheistic/agnostic organization whose primary goals include maintaining the separation of church and state and individual liberty in the jurisdictions in which they operate. 

They're high-minded legal trolls and fucking brilliant at it. Watching the Christofacists of Ottawa County melt down about them is going to be hilarious.

Edit: to the person that sent sent me a "Reddit cares" message: remove your lips from Trump's elderly dong and get a life
Can I get a “HELL yeah!”
Ironically Christian nationalism is far more satanic then the actual church of Satan
Joe Moss is going to shit his pants, I can't even imagine what the weird sign guy will do.  He posted a protect childhood innocence sign in front of his seat when the lgbtq friendly church minister got to pray.
Hail Santa!!! 😎 What's an invocation??
They do some damn good work.
Good for them.  The Satanic Temple is a great organization.  Obviously there is a lot of misunderstanding related to them.  I imagine their "Invocation" in West Michigan will send certain people into a tizzy.
I’m coming in full Baphomet regalia and I’m bringing the popcorn
The pearls will be clutched. 

Someone get the fainting couches and the smelling salts a ready!
All for it! Exorcise the shit out of Ottawa County!
Where and when?
This is gonna go over great in west Michigan lol
I didnt expect to see TST in this sub, pretty cool to see 2 communities im apart of interact
Ahhhhhhh!!! It’s high time. I am so happy to hear this. Do you know when so we can watch for it? Are you sending out press releases about it?
I hope MSP provide security. Zealots are known to get violent over anything "satanic" and I don't trust Ottawa County police or sherriff department to be unbias if the religious loons get nutty.
Oh hell yes!  Looking forward to reading about this on MLive.
Watching morons FREAK over this is so satisfying. 

“The Satanic Temple encourages benevolence and empathy, rejects tyrannical authority, advocates practical common sense, opposes injustice, and undertakes noble pursuits. The Satanic Temple uses Satan as a symbol of the eternal rebel fighting arbitrary authority and oppressive social norms.”
Hail 1A 

Hail TST W MI 

Hail Satan ⛧
Cool! Jamestown will lose their minds!
Hail to Lucifer!
Hell yeah, this is fantastic.
Hey, if you favor one religion, you've got to favor them all.  Take turns.  HAHAHA
TST is such a brilliant invention. The benefits of classifying your bodily autonomy under religion is good enough, but the added bonus of rustling jimmies of people who actually think it is about Satan is *chef's kiss*
When is this?

Edit: whoever is reporting this as potential self harm: I’m sorry your religiosity is so fragile, instead, try prayer. I mean, he took a nap for the entire holocaust, but maybe now he will be all ears.
honestly I've seen the way that modern Christians act, if Satanism is opposed to that then I'm all for it.
Bout time. Keep up the good work.
Love those guys.
Is this real? I genuinely want to know if/where I can watch this!
I’m more concerned with Christian churches (particularly mega churches, Christofascists, and Christian Nationalists), this in no way feels threatening they aren’t knocking on doors pushing their beliefs, they aren’t causing disruption at school meetings, and they aren’t acting like their views are priority over others in politics.
I mean, great, but explain to me again why a *government* function needs a *religious* invocation of *any kind.*
Ottawa County has been a racist shithole my entire life.
I can't believe I'm going to miss one of the finest spectacles Ottawa County (and Grand Haven, I assume?) has ever seen. Gonna have to ask the fam to visit in my place. Pearl clutching will abound, surely.
Fuck yeah man
Cool, team! Way.to.go! 😂
Well, there is no god so can’t hurt to learn new things.
I’m so excited!! I’m gonna bring my Baphie coffee mug.
Haha! This is beautiful. I’m a lifelong Christian but I absolutely love how genuinely helpful the Satanic Temple has been to people who need their services.
Well this could get interesting
Absolutely amazing
Nice to see some religion diversity around here😅
make sure to swing on by the Berkley community meeting as well, i am shocked every time they start with a prayer.
FUCK YEAH, HAIL SATAN
This is great! I don't go in for any religion, but it's great to hear that you're getting equal time, as it were.
What day is this happening?
I hope Satan actually makes an appearance this time. I keep going to all the public events and the man himself is never around. I’m this close to becoming a Luciferian.
Hail yeah!
this should be wonderful to watch indeed
Can someone from another county attend?
They are teaching the zoomed in muggles to zoom out and I love it.
All Hail NATAS!
Nice
Fun!!
hail satan!
I'm going to hang the posters around downtown grand haven
Ottawa has better selection of pepper corns in their stores.
Can someone ELI5?  Like, I know what the satanic Temple is and what they represent. What does this mean for the Ottawa County Commission? Is this just a meeting that they're opening for? 

I'm excited, but I don't know what this means really.
If you have been following the goings on in Ottawa county and a group called Ottawa Impact you understand this post, even if it is a joke. It is a joke right??
This is good news. Yahweh and Satan are the same guy anyway.
Hail Satan

Invocation by the Incredible String Band. Found it in a playlist from Woodstock and it's really amazing.

They were invited by Ottawa County right? Am I reading that wrong?
As if the satanic temple is normal
Right winger here. I'm extremely happy about this. I'd be even happier if we could take ALL religion out of politics.
Don't forget, Lavey Satanism is just Ayn Rand with candles. The libertarian right is receptive to this sort of thing.
When I first head of TST, I was really confused because the tenets they were promoting seemed like good things to me... It challenged me even though I haven't cared for religion in 35 years and considered myself atheist...
I love this lol. You are indeed the sassiest of pants haha
The only people that have a reason to be mad at the Satanic Temple are those upset to see one area of Christian theocratic control of government decline.
Yep - they are a true test of Freedom of Religion....which we all grew up being taught was what this nation was founded on.  Go get it. 
I need them to open a satellite temple in the st Joseph area. For Reasons.
I'm a practising Lutheran and regard them with mild amusement.
I’m a former catholic. I went to 12 years of catholic school, 4 of those being in an all boys high school. At least it was a Jesuit education. I’m not Christian anymore, and after visiting the Vatican and seeing its opulence, I understand the Protestant Reformation. It’s the religious version of the French Revolution 

I love the satanic temple. Any real Christian would know this organization is primarily a joke, and also a firewall between church and state. 

REAL Christians, inspired by the words of Jesus and not their pastor, preacher, etc. should join with the satanic church in doing good works for the less fortunate.
Well, hail yourself dude.
You really are the sassiest of pants and I’m here for it.
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|upvote)
You’re cool
It dislike them precisely because they are high-minded legal trolls. It gets on my nerves how committed to the bit they are. Yes, technically, from a legal standpoint, there is no way to differentiate what they're doing from a legitimate religion. But anybody with a brain can tell that TST is an elaborate civil protest, not a spiritual movement.


But they get really pissy when you point this out, because their technically-a-religion-in-the-eyes-of-the-government status rests upon them continually acting as if they were one. And in order to maintain the charade, they must not ever admit that they don't actually believe in Satan. This aggravates me, someone who agrees with their goal and philosophy. I don't imagine it will be very effective at converting opponents to their cause.


I understand their point. I just think they're being counterproductively adversarial in making it.
HELL yeah!  -from an Ottawa County resident.
Woah, immediate flashbacks of the Blue Mountain State intro as I read that lol.
HELL YEAH - Ottawa County resident
HELL YEAH BORTHER.
And the Satanic Temple is far more Christian than televangelists.
Go on. I would like to hear more.

Forget the article. 
How’d you do that?
The yokels will come out of the woodwork!!!
I also would like to know!
[deleted]
if folks would take a minute to actually investigate the satanic temple they would realize it has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with satan or devil worshipping and everything to do with personal freedom and agency from religious oppression and the exact bullshit that you speak of.

All organized religion is terrible. They use an imaginary figure to oppress and abuse people, not to mention all of the fucking cash they sit on without paying a cent in taxes.
Precisely their point.
You're in luck the meetings get posted to YouTube! Well if anything too rowdy happens, it might not... 
I'm from Grand Haven and I'm thinking about coming home to see this!
An invocation is a little speech that’s meant to kick off a meeting. It is often religious but doesn’t have to be. My fraternity in college had a chaplain position whose only job was to deliver an inspiring speech at the start of each weekly meeting. 

If I had to guess,  the temple probably saw Christians dominating the invocation speeches at these county meetings and decided to act as a counterbalance. 

So it’s not consequential at all, but it’s sure to get some people riled up.
They may be corny, but they're doing gods work.  
Er....you know what I mean.
Awe come on.  We could have been neighbors.
Ottawa County is also happy about it. buh-bye
They are also a way to practice philosophy and art through spirituality and the metaphysical... but yea people try to pull it into the physical world and it doesn't work right.

Bruh, read their [beliefs](https://thesatanictemple.com/pages/about-us) and let me know what doesn't jive with your version of Golden Rule.
right.  karma is necessary for a good life?  a belief in a made up sense of cosmic justice?
What's edgy about satanism?
Most of what Christians do these days isn't what Jesus would do, either - but here we are.
The Satanic Temple is probably more aligned with what Jesus actually taught than the modern Christian church.
If you're Christian, you have no idea who Jesus really was. Christianity was invented after Jesus died. Books were written long after his passing, modified by the person paying for a copy to be made. There's just so much wrong with your stance on what Jesus would do.
im sure jesus would say stuff like this, though

Cool. So are we gonna talk about how Christians are so mask off they're digging into the backs of their skulls, searching for something left to peel?
How do you feel about the likes of say Kenneth Copeland lying and bilking his followers out of money for another private jet? Or Joel Olsteen not opening the doors to his megachurch to help flood victims because he just got new carpet? Or all the Evangelical churches who have aligned behind Trump and ignore how he embodies all the sins?

That's not how budgets work.

Do some actual research on The Satanic Temple (not to be confused with the Church of Satan - completely different organizations) next time
Fun fact, The Satanic Temple doesn't believe in the Devil/Satan.
And worshiping god and other fictitious characters is not a joke?  The satanic church doesn’t even worship satan.  It is just symbolism that cry baby christians fall for.
Holland voted for Biden in 2020 (by 11 percentage points, no less), for Clinton in 2016, and Obama in 2008.
And those suckers hurt.  Made of wood.
My coffee just flew out of my mouth. Lol
They're being sued over this very thing, so it's likely an attempt to look neutral.
Not trying to attack you, but I am curious how you square away your desire to remove religion from politics, while remaining a right winger. It seems to me that the American right wing uses religion at nearly every chance they get.
Right. This is the correct take. But until then (lol) more inclusion is better
> happier if we could take ALL religion out of politics

> Right winger

No, you're not. At least not in 2024 America.

Maybe you were right wing in 1955. Not anymore.
Why are you still conservative when every leader for the past twenty years at a minimum has been synonymous with Evangelical fundamentalism? They deny there is separation of church and state, say the US is a Christian nation, have an ongoing crusade against abortion and contraception, and are overtly racist and hostile to every other religion?
i was thinking along these lines last night while reading about the israel-palestine conflict... its no wonder a state founded on the basis of a religion itself has been the center of so much conflict.
Libertarian so rightish I guess here?


Agreed. Not my business what you praise. As long as it's not like. Hurting others who really gives a shit. I'll go. Huh well that's weird, and walk on by. 1a protects everyone's speech even if it's something I don't like. That's how it works
> Right winger here.

Just out of curiosity, what do you mean by "right-winger"?

Christian Nationalism seems to be a pretty core aspect of that worldview.
Welcome to the point that the Satanic temple is trying to make.
You are not a modern Trumpian right-winger.
Center fielder here… couldn’t agree more.

Which is higher a law or belief? What do you think the "elite" satanists do with their control over people? 

Maybe the same legitimate criticisms Christian churches get could apply to them? Wouldn't that be ironic.
You know the laws of physics, thermodynamics, logic, and cause and effect?

"Do as thou wilt" is literally a joke to trap YOU, because the true second part is "because it will be done unto you." If it was the whole of the law wtf bother saying it?

That's added to make it sound complete because the essential part they took out.
Hi just like to chime in ToS isn’t actually formed of satanist. They’re more agnostic and atheists. Its a long standing political stunt.

*Church* of Satan = Satanist

The Satanic Temple (*TST*) = Separation of church and state activists.
I know, it would be kinda ironic if this location is on a dirt road.
The government funds and are involved in most of these organizations and I kinda wanna know why.
From their site: "IF YOU DO NOT BELIEVE IN THE SUPERNATURAL, HOW IS TST A RELIGION? 

* The idea that religion belongs to supernaturalists is ignorant, backward, and offensive. The metaphorical Satanic construct is no more arbitrary to us than are the deeply held beliefs that we actively advocate. Are we supposed to believe that those who pledge submission to an ethereal supernatural deity hold to their values more deeply than we? Are we supposed to concede that only the superstitious are rightful recipients of religious exemption and privilege? Satanism provides all that a religion should be without a compulsory attachment to untenable items of faith-based belief. It provides a narrative structure by which we contextualize our lives and works. It also provides a body of symbolism and religious practice — a sense of identity, culture, community, and shared values."

They are a registered Religion so what is your point again???
I did not saying that worshiping any God is not a joke!
[deleted]
There's also a church on every street corner. Probably not as amenable as you would think...
It just means he identifies as right wing overall, doesn't mean he has to be right wing on every specific issue.
Pew research shows only 54% of "unaffiliated" religious voters are democrat.  That 46% is an awful lot of moderate to conservative unaffiliated folks.  So if you assume all of them would prefer separation of church and state, and a fair majority of Biblical conservatives do as well in my circles at least.

You don't have to be religious to be conservative, such as the pro-life stance.  Almost a full 25% of people with no religious affiliation would vote for abortion to be illegal in most cases.
Right, so have every religion speak there.
In 1954 they added "ONE NATION UNDER GOD" to all the currency that didn't have it yet, made "One nation under God" the US motto, and added "under God" to the Pledge of Allegiance.  That was roughly the start of the nationwide plague of stupidity and violence that we're dealing with today.  Gotta go back a little farther, but I'm not sure how far.
This is the problem with identity politics.

Dude is obviously not a right winger anymore but they still have his vote because he thinks he's right wing. Despite probably being much more liberal minded.
Libertarians still fall on the right wing of American politics.
> Maybe you were right wing in 1955. Not anymore.

If you're liberal or conservative you're right wing. If you were right wing in '55 you're still right wing today.
Interesting. I know several right wing individuals, many who are not religious to one degree or another. So ya, 2024 America, nonreligious, right wing. You have to take into consideration that not all right wingers are the same. There's a reasonable size group of right wing folks who absolutely hate Trump.

Surprisingly, I have found left wingers to be more consistent in their professed beliefs, though I suspect much of that is a front so they fit in and don't get cancelled.

BTW, I'm very much an independent thinker who despises both the Democratic party and the GOP.
“Conservative” doesn’t mean what it once did, but both ends of the circle (or wings) remain the same.
Right wingers are gonna be pissed about this!

Right winger isn’t pissed. 

You’re not a real right winger!!!!


My god this is pathetic
He could mean fiscal conservative, they do classify as right wingers too. Not everyone has to be a bible thumper.
I vote republican. 
I believe in personal responsibility. 
I don't support socialized Healthcare. 
I don't support student loan forgiveness. 
I don't believe that women can be men & vice-versa. 
I refuse to take their experimental vaccine. 
I think every American should own a gun. 
I believe those who call themselves "woke" are the biggest threat to our Republic. 
I believe that the less the government interferes with our lives, the better off we are. 
I think we should have a border wall. 
I think we should abolish the ATF and the IRS. 
I think we should privatize social security. 
I believe the American people were better off when Trump was in office.
Have that dude who tracks Elon and Taylor swift track this dude too.  I'd be interested in that
So … lingojam gotcha lol
I don’t think I have ever seen TST endorse a candidate.
They have though...They've got religious ceremonies and iconography removed from government establishments.

I have no idea what strawman you're trying to put up but can you at least acknowledge that their beliefs don't run afoul of any Golden Rule, which was your beef in your comment before it was removed?

Paul was allegedly a heretic who was tossed by the followers of Jesus. In that regard, Pauline Christianity has nothing to do with Jesus. It is what it is.

Feels like this was the rogue with a level or two in bard.
I’m surprised it hit tbh.
TST doesn't actually believe in or worship Satan. They exist to do community work and, at a higher level, promote and maintain the separation of church and state as well as individual liberty. 

I strongly suggest you look up their website and read about them in their own words, rather than making assumptions and taking TST at surface level. You may learn something new.

Edit: saved you some work https://thesatanictemple.com/pages/about-us
I'm not a democrat and I'm an atheist.

I don't wonder why everyone outside of cities worship Trump. I know why; they are isolated, ignorant, and reactionaries. They have been groomed by Fox News and right wing AM radio to believe that everyone is coming to get them, that there are all these enemies who want to take all their things, and they are too weak to realize they are being manipulated by fascists who play them like a fiddle. They think that's a catharsis, but it's just feeding into a perpetual cycle that makes them arrogant, aggrieved, and anti-social all at the behest of corrupt, power hunger assholes who are the ones ACTUALLY planning on taking all they hold dear way.

But with that out of the way all I did was ask a question and you didn't answer. You instead went on the attack. Which tells me you didn't think about the question or you did but you didn't like the answer.

When you say "I follow Christ" what you're really saying is that you warp the messages in the bible (guessing you haven't read it) in order to justify and validate hate and paranoia. It allows you to reject common sense in favor for a delusion that feels right. All while turning your back at an obvious rot within the Religion you claim you're not a part of but you're not really fooling anyone.

Also, the Satanic Temple doesn't believe in Satan. They're political and they are fighting for your freedoms.
Dude, take 2 seconds to read about them. They literally don't believe in or worship Satan.
Removed. See rule #8 in the [r/Michigan subreddit rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Michigan/wiki/index#wiki_rules).
I refuse your king in totallity. Your religion and indeed all modern religions as a whole. I believe in seperation of church and state which is the stated goal of TST. Until we achieve that seperation I believe the government shall be compelled to treat all religions equally.
Not in the US he isn't.  We live in a representative democracy rather than a monarchy, so there is no government role of "king" designated to any role of authority.  Unless you mean he is king like those little kids with the Burger King hats say they are king.
>Sorry but Jesus is King 👑

Is a myth made up by people who wanted to usurp power from Kings. Religion at it's core is an organization created so that a select few assholes could get power and wealth and influence. It's just another power structure which has become degenerate and corrupt and craven. How many centuries is it going to take before we stop pretending that these fairy tales are just another product being sold by greedy motherfuckers?
Jesus was a black woman
King of sadistic people who are willing to kill their children for a twisted mythological ideology.
Good answer.
I agree, we need to stop giving religious organizations tax breaks!  Shame on the government for funding them.
Government shouldn’t be funding them?
You are thinking of churches, you hate churches not religions

That's nearly every city or large town in Southern Michigan though.
Holland = Holland. I’m proud to say that at least Holland is becoming a bit more progressive, even if it still has a long way to come. But, Holland should not be included in the labels the surrounding areas get.
Yeah, no it is not.
I see what you did there 🙏🏼
Sure, but that's the sort of issue that seems like it would steer someone away from a group of people who are making policy decisions based on religion, which is why I asked.
That doesn't really answer my question, but thanks for the effort.

I'm curious WHY people who claim to want religion out of politics are willing to embrace a political party that does the exact opposite. The fact that it's happening is plainly obvious, it's the why that intrigues me.
I've been mildly obsessed with westward expansion (mostly the years leading up to the Civil War), and lemme tell ya, American Exceptionalism/Manifest Destiny is the OG brain worm. Which predates the era I'm speaking of, of course, but it is the fuel to much of this madness.
"One nation under God" was added to the Pledge. They made "In God We Trust" the national motto. 

We can thank the Knights of Columbus for vandalizing the Pledge. We can thank Billy Graham, the State of Florida, and the American Legion for changing the national motto.
Nah look at his further comments in this thread. Dude is a stereotypical right winger that just isn't as religious. Nothing he believes is liberal
You can be right wing and liberal. It's a whole quadrant of the political compass
I lean right and am not religious, I don't think it's a defining factor of the right even though a lot are.
the real problem is the two party system. you gotta pick a side, unfortunately. if we had more sides to pick, or no sides at all, the country would benefit massively.
i recently learned [FDR was very anti ideology](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/08/16/democrats-socialism-fdr-roosevelt-227622/)
Libertarians? You mean pro-choice, don't care if you're gay/trans, pro-weed, no corporate bailouts, no religion in government, no morality laws, no problems with women being independent, pro-open borders, those kind of people?

Bro, they aren't part of the American right and haven't been for awhile.

So you think we should have carbon and pollution taxes? How about congestion pricing for roads?
People who believe that there is systematic inequality and we should take steps to eliminate or lessen that inequality is the greatest threat to our republic?

Okay.
You believe "the less government interferes with our lives the better", but see no problem with a police officer hitting a handcuffed woman. Yep, definitely a "right winger".

Typical neckbeard response. Oh shit! Are you going to dig through my profile now!?
Doesnt make a difference to me if they are “Pretending” to worship satan to spite the christians or not. I don’t need to read one damn thing about them. Their name and symbol speaks volumes. They are meddling with forces beyond their understanding.
If you heard about a charity named “Hitler’s Nazis” and they used the swastika as their logo, is there a description they could write on their website that would make it OK with you?

The name and symbol alone are acts of worship, whether they are smart enough to realize that or not.
Ok Demon
😂 
Nothing triggers your master like the true king.
You’re right let’s just worship Satan to prove God isn’t real 🙃
I like you for this.
I thought he was a white man
Those are call serial killers and often have psychopathy.
Yeah abortion is wild
Someone caught it 🙌🙌
Jamestown township successfully voted to defund the public library due to them not putting books with homosexuality behind the front counter. Lots of Tudor Dixon and Trump signs out here.
At least you can buy weed in Grand Haven.  Holland and Zeeland refuse to sell it so I drive to Saugatuck and let them enjoy the tax Dollaz.
A bit more progressive being like. Downgrading from dropping the n bomb to using "coloreds" but yeah sure.

I kid but I feel like I'm not that far off. Plus Holland liberals are all rich liberals in my experience
Funny you say that, because I thought of good old Manifest Destiny when I was making my comment.  Maybe it goes all the way back to the original settlers, who left England because it wasn't religiously extreme enough for their liking.
I worked with a guy like this, total Athiest but loves him some Ben Shapiro and "limited gubmnt" but would send me crazy videos of Kenneth Copeland and be like, "you beleive this shit?"
How exactly?
Liberalism is right wing. It's not even some massively complicated thing.
That’s centrist
Religion is the single unifying thread among the American right. 

Could an atheist win any electon today as a republican? 

There is no other trait that is automatically disqualifying. A trans person would do quite well in the GOP as long as they hate trans people. 
What a very lousy article.

Twisting the words of a dead man to damnify the closest party to his values.

Par for the course of pro-Republican propaganda.

When they referenced Fox News as a source I visibly cringed.
Just because you don't want a large government in people's lives doesn't mean you're not part of the political right. You may not be a social conservative but in the textbook sense libertarians are DEFINITELY right wing in that they support a reduced government and more strict limits on governmental powers.

But let's look at the social and moral "righteousness" that libertarians claim to have. They think that simply wanting to prevent government from interference in our lives somehow makes them progressive. It doesn't. Apathy isn't justice. What do libertarians have to say about providing equity in education, housing, voting rights, compensation, Healthcare rights, etc? What will libertarians do to undo decades of unfair treatment and social limitations on minority groups and religions? 

Defending justice and democracy requires an active interest, not indifference and apathy. It's not enough to just nuke the government and leave everyone to fend for themselves in the world they are left with.
It also means at the wing, i.e. much farther than just center-right
See then you’re just making generalizations off of your own opinion. Instead of actually using facts

Brainwashed and uneducated. Yeah, that's it.  That's a pretty typical leftist response. Do you have any original thoughts you can call your own? Or do you just copy and paste from everybody else?
All of them.
i mean, editing comments to make it look like you werent confused sure is a strategy...
dont need to as you obviously have an issue with projection.
Ok, remain ignorant forever then. You have the opportunity to learn something new and are blinded by your preconceptions and biases. It's a sad way to spend this life, but I guess that's what you want.
Worship doesn't exist.

Also, if Hitler's Nazis were feeding children and volunteering at animal shelters and not hating minorities and maybe just liked German Shepherds a lot that'd be fine.

Their actions show you who they are.

I mean, I'd take issue with their PR ability and marketing sense but I'm not going to hate them for being nazis when they aren't nazis.
To quote you: 

"Yes, he is." Lucifer stands for freedom. Light hates to be in a cage, light is intelligence, light is freedom. Serving God is slavery.
And who exactly is my master?
They don't worship Satan. 

They use that as a way to show how in the tank people are for Christianity. Throwing away basic ideals of this country and giving themselves over to zealous delusions to justify their repulsive, anti-social behavior.
How is it wild tho? Bruh it’s completely necessary in a good modern society. Do you believe people should be forced to carry their rapists child??
> Yeah abortion is wild

So, this is just interesting (maybe just to me), and a bit past the time frame I mentioned earlier... 

Charles Ingalls came from a Puritan family. He was, of course, all about that good ol Manifest Destiny.

We know the general story of his Westward travels with his wife and daughters, Mary, Laura, Carrie, and Grace.

Rose Wilder, the great-granddaughter of Puritans and Laura's daughter, became a dear friend and supporter of Ayn Rand. Free market libertarianism, baby. And here's the fun part:

She provided generous financial support to a free market school in Colorado: The Freedom School. Two of its most successful alumni? Charles and David Koch.

Anyway, just one story about how a thread from my idiot ancestors (plot twist: I come from a branch off Rose's Great-Grandfather) took a shitty, incredibly harmful ideal and ruined everything. 

I don't know how to end this post, lol.
Eww, Libertarians. 

For real though, what planet do Libertarians live on?
Being a libertarian. It’s really easy to be if you ignore basically everything around you.
Liberalism is a right wing ideology that only looks like it might be left wing because we've stamped out all leftist ideology in the US. All liberals are right wing.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Political_Compass?wprov=sfla1
Exactly. People have a hard time disconnecting party from right/left liberal/authoritarian. A lot of it come from all the political rhetoric they hear.
I don't think an atheist could win as a Democrat either. I'd be suprised if even a non Christian could win frankly.

Its interesting that I've never been disqualified even though I'm very open about not being religious.
This is simply not true. There are *plenty* of right wingers in America that are not religious.
i am endlessly amused how often ill make a comment replying to someone in one thread and then in another seemingly unrelated thread my reply is just as relevant. [for example](https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1bhqb9s/comment/kvgsd44/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3):  


>>>>(quoting another comment): The only corruption of society in my view is the fact that our infrastructure, cultural norms, and technology have breeded people like you who twist facts so brazenly and expect to not be corrected, further leading even more unskeptical thinkers astray.

>the thing about critical thinking and being skeptical is that requires you to understand and apply a bit of nuance. point being you can agree with some points someone makes, or an article makes, while disagreeing with other points. on this point, i would argue that his thoughts about how modern economics disregards ethics (etc) contradicts with the reality of immigration in the context of climate change and the ways we have (arguably) caused societal unrest in various countries around the world.

in my [other comments linking to the article youre criticizing](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=author%3Arelevantusername2020%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.politico.com%2Fmagazine%2Fstory%2F2019%2F08%2F16%2Fdemocrats-socialism-fdr-roosevelt-227622%2F&type=comment) i mentioned that it seemed to be written as a bit of a hit piece on Bernie Sanders but you can ignore the (obvious) bias from the article and instead focus on the facts - which is what i was referencing it for: that FDR despised ideology and saw how easily it could lead to basically what we have today, and what is important is the ideas - relying on the "label" applied to ideas is being intellectually lazy.

Libertarianism is the ideology of choice of those who are both uneducated and arrogant.
Holy shit there's two of us in the thread? This has to be a record.
That's not an answer. 

If you're right wing then you're voting for Republicans who are doing things like restricting rights, attacking voter freedom, deregulating corporations that make everyone sicker and not just perpetuate but accelerate the capture of our economy by the super wealthy that has done nothing but to drum up income disparity and inequality and create the shit show we're in. 

So if you're voting for Republicans then you're putting into people who are antithetical to what you claim to believe. And I don't care what you say you are, I care what you do. And if you put Republicans in power you ain't a liberal.
There are, indeed, Jewish, Muslim, and other non-Christian folks serving as elected officials around the country and in the Congress.

Granted, other than 2 Jewish Republicans in Congress, the rest of the "non-Christians" are Democrats AFAIK.

Same.
Asking a legitimate question, where would someone land if they believe that the federal government has a purpose but is grossly misused? I support Trans rights, bodily autonomy, the 2nd amendment, social safety nets with common sense, voting rights, and democracy as an ideal.

I've been looking at it as libertarian-left, and an-com stuff appeals as well, but I'm interested in reading more specific theory.
>That's not an answer. 

It is. It explains what it means to be liberal and right. 

>If you're right wing then you're voting for Republicans

That's not always true. I've meet lots of people who are liberal and right and voted for Biden in 2020. Does that make them a leftist?  No. 

The real problem is that the US has the electoral college and has a two party system because of it. This means that like unlike other countries where people have have multiple parties to choose from and can pick one that better fits their political stance, we are stuck having to pick between to parties that do a shitty job representing the people. Because of the two party system, neither party has to try to do much for the people who vote for them, they only have to do enough to do better than the other party in certain areas to keep people voting for them so they can keep power. 

Many people will vote for one party one election then vote for another party the next election. Does this mean they are jumping back and forth every couple of years from being left wing to right wing and back? No, that would be stupid to think. People don't change their political views that much. Voting democrat or republican doesn't automatically make you left wing or right wing. It just means you voted for a democrat or republican.
Ah I thought we were just talking about president. In that case Kyrsten Sinema is a current member of congress who is not religious.

Personally, I think in general people should be more responsible, both with sex and what to do after sex… I’m more concerned with the 99% of abortions than the outliers. A lot of people kill their babies who would have been the greatest source of joy and purpose they would have ever known on this earth. I think that’s very tragic. I think society should be more family centric and I think big families are awesome.

I don’t wish to be in a position to make the law, I’d rather live in a society where people did the right thing... but I do think anything past basically the first trimester is pretty much murder.

Libertarian left is not a thing. Libertarians believe in staunchly right wing economic policies. If you are referring to the “liberal” nature of libertarian beliefs; remember liberal is SOUTH on the political compass not left. So libertarians are actually south right.

Just because you believe the government is misusing its power does not mean that you ideologically believe that we shouldn’t have a government.
Some variety of liberal/progressive/leftist. 

You described what the left is fighting for to a T. 

The right has this ongoing bullshit campaign against the left because they do not have a single solitary good argument to refute shit like, Trans people are people and deserve rights. Their arguments are "no because we find them icky and we want to use the violence of the state to eradicate them". They know how awful that is. 

Being on the left just means you have common sense, a basic understanding of how things function and a modicum of compassion. 

Libertarians are a shit show. Go online and look at some of their conventions. There is one infamous one where they are fighting on whether or not we should have driver's licenses or if you think your 5 year old can drive have at it. They're insane.

Talk to any Libertarian and ask them to explain their position and you will see how badly thought out it is. Ask them what their plan is to deal with their shit. Like their literal feces. Because we in reality have a sewage system. Have them follow the logical next question of what do you do about the disease waste causes, how do you plan to process it, what if there's contamination, how will you know? 

You know what's a good example of libertarianism in action? Cyberpunk 2077. 

You want medical care? Shit you'd better pay out the ass for the Trauma Team insurance and if not, fuck you, go find some ripperdoc in a back alley to give you some street drugs to patch you up. If you're poor it's better you just die in the combat zone because the NCPD don't patrol a certain neighborhood because they didn't get paid and now you are up to your ass in gangers. 

Then of course eat your highly processed vending machine food from the one megacorp who is selling synthetic meat with just enough nutrients to keep you going. Anti-trust laws? Monopolies? Get outta here with that. They own everything and if competition does emerge they'd better come with a fuckin' army. If that happens good news, that corp is going to hire you for cheap to fight for them in a corporate war.
Umm … pro-gun democrat?
>It is. It explains what it means to be liberal and right.

Well, let's be real. It's an internet test. There's even a section in that wikipedia page talking about it's short comings and who has criticized it. It's not scientific. 

You can't take that test and then assume with 100% accuracy that's what you are for the sole reason is that labels are fucking meaningless. 

I have no idea if I am a liberal, progressive, leftist or centrist. I have been called all those things by different people. Shit, look at music. What's alternative rock verses garage rock verses indie rock verses prog rock...it's enough to make you want to beat your head against a wall. 

&#x200B;

>That's not always true. I've meet lots of people who are liberal and right and voted for Biden in 2020. Does that make them a leftist?  No.

Biden isn't a liberal. He's been more progressive than I expected but he's not a liberal or a leftist. He's got a record of conservative policies. But regardless, he voted for the democrat, so his claim that he's "right" doesn't hold water because he didn't put the right wing candidate in power. 

So they don't identify with conservatives. 

And what it is to be progressive or conservative changes. Especially as it shifts to the right with the increasingly violent and dangerous rhetoric from Conservatives as they move the overton window. So your friend might think he's a conservative but the party has moved away from him. The window has shifted and he could not go where the party is now. 

So calling himself a conservative doesn't apply.

My husband yells "south Detroit is just canada!" Everytime this song comes on. I need to buy him this shirt. 
I don't stop believing.
I was born in 'South Detroit'...
I get it. I also used to Live in West Windsor, NJ, which I used to chuckle to myself about being Detroit, NJ.
I tell everyone who will listen you can travel south from America into Canada and every time they’re like sir, this is a Wendy’s.
i like the look on faces when you explain geography to them.
I got it immediately. WINDSOR!
guess you'll have to take them on a little journey to see this place for themselves
I once referred to Windsor as Michigan's taint in front of a group of Canadians. Didn't go over well.
I have the same shirt.  Nice and soft and a great representation of the city and our friends to the south
Windsor
Awesome shirt, and technically... well shit
Almost got that at Arts, Beats, and Eats!
This is the most Canadian thing ever .

I like to think that Canadians are just mistaken as polite. Their sarcasm is just that subtle.
Everyone says south Detroit is Canada but… wouldn’t downtown just be south Detroit since it’s the southern most part of Detroit?.. I know, I’m a hoot at parties.
My maternal grandmother was from Harrow, Ontario (southeast of Windsor). Her nephew (my mom's cousin - one of the coolest people I have ever known, with the driest sense of humor) was born there. He used to tell people he was from "south of Detroit." Everyone would guess he was from places like Trenton or Monroe. He loved telling that story. 

Great shirt!
OP is helping us kick start our holiday shopping! Love it!!

I appreciate it, OP

Love it. 

Don't Stop Believing
This is excellent.  I have had arguments with people because they just assume downriver is "South Detroit".  No one really thinks about how Windsor exists and is directly south.  Like downriver is west, but the i75 sign says south, so they think it's south.
I get it

I get it.
Born and raised.
It would be quite the “Journey “ to go there so “Don’t stop believing “ and you just might make it…
I get it
I got it!
Geography jokes are not for everyone lol

Love it though
Is this a Windsor joke?
...born and raised in...
I LOVE THIS 

Being from The Detroit area, I like to tell people that when I lived in Michigan my Good Neighbor to the south was Canada. They just look and say what are you talking about, Mexico is our southern neighbor.
I work at a wedding venue in the metro area. Every time this song gets played I get old man cranky and say “that’s not a thing that’s Canada.”  It’s to the point my staff gets excited when they hear it so they can see me get all pissed off over nothing. 

I’m just north of 30.
Pretty sure I saw somebody wearing this on a midnight train going anywhere
she took the midnight train goin eeeenyywhaaaaaerr
Windsor. It's Windsor isn't it?
This is clever. Makes it that much more satisfying when someone does get it
Love it.
I love it!
Drive directly south from Detroit and you are in Canada.  Weird fact
That’s hilarious. I want one.
My wife is a huge Journey fan.

I told her that "South Detroit" is Windsor, Ontario. 🇨🇦
I yell that ever time I hear that song hahahaha, That’s Canada!!!
Care to explain the humor?  I live 40 mins from Detroit.  Have my whole life and I don't get the joke.
Born and raised?
Really?!
Windsor!!!! Lol
It’s the song.
Windsor FTW!
Under the Umbrella Tree and Fred Penner forever.
I want that shirt
Love it!
Can anyone explain this to me?
Lyric was originally “… Windsor” but “South Detroit” is clearly better.
Detroit is the only place in the continental US where you go south to get to Canada.
How boot them Lions, eh?
this is amazing
Lol
Did you get this shirt in Royal Oak?
I get it. That shirt is amazing
Where did you get that? I WANT ONE!
I mean I'm 24 and I understood 🤷🏻‍♀️
I always told people south Detroit was the river.
You must be just a city boy, I guess?
I’m from Downriver…..you know….south of Detroit….
Windsor Ontario south of Detroit
I need this
U mean east detroit
Born and raised!
Everybody knows the first country you come to that is south of detroit is Canada, therefore south detroit must be Windsor.
I have that as a decal on my car
Windsor
My daughter and son in law live in Windsor. I bought him one for Christmas! (Royal Oak here!)
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I get it. When I play it my daughters in their 30s laugh too! Where can I get that shirt!
Haha’. I love it.  I want one and I’m not Canadian.
“🎶Just a Ciiiitttayy Bbboooiiii!!🎶”
Because “South Detroit” is SW Windsor, CA
I don't get it? I assume south park but I'm probably wrong
I hate that F’n song.
Whoever didn’t get it ain’t supposed to.
Lived in Windsor my whole life, I need this shirt! I also saw one that said "Detroitish" at Eastern market once that I missed out on, would love to find it again.
Born and raised
I have an old t-shirt that I’ve had for 13ish years that’s almost identical, but the print is almost completely gone.
I got it!  I know Windsor is south of Detroit
my uncle from windsor has this shirt!
I have the same shirt. Nobody has ever commented about the reference 🙄
Haha, windsor is south of Detroit
You maple folks sure do have a funny way of spelling 'Toledo.'
That’s because they’re not from Detroit.
I'd wear that up and down the boulevards.
You need to start hanging around new people.
I love this. 😂
I LoLed!
Hilarious. I love this shirt! Unless you live here a little known fact is Windsor is south of Detroit!
Totally got it on the first round.  Love from West Hollywood!
I get it, but I think of Delray as south Detroit
I get it. I cringe every time people go crazy for the line in Don’t Stop Believing. I want to scream “you’re cheering for Canada you knuckleheads!”
Journey song calls out South Detroit, which is Canada
If printing for US market I can understand how no one would get it.
That's Windsor
I have always said, the song is about a guy from Windsor.
Windsor!
No, "south Detroit" is "down river"
Geography can be fun!
Lol!!!!
I grew up in the metro and never understood “south Detroit “ lmao
I guess I'm old, too. I got it immediately.
Brilliant! 🤣
Oh, I got it. That’s why I hate Journey.
I was born 3 miles north of Canada.
Neither do I
Ugh. Terrible song.
I want to support our friends in Windsor Ontario!  I love the sweatshirt!!!! 
Remember the average American is STUPID

I refer to our wonderful city as North Windsor lol
Canada isn’t south of Detroit though….
No one got it = no one cares.
![gif](giphy|mreXWhhWkoMWQ|downsized)
Only when the Wolverine Amtrak is delayed
I just moved to Detroit/Michigan two years ago and had no idea this was some sort of inside joke.  It’s fun to learn new things about your new hometown
Born and raised
Or because smoky rooms aren't really a thing anymore
Don't. stop. believing
Haha I got this right away and I don’t live in Detroit.
Those songs that are only good when drunk
Windsor? I barely know her eh
My best friend says the same thing every time she hears the song. I've found her Christmas present 💀
The amount of snickering that happens at any Detroit sporting event immediately after we all scream that one line is why I adore my hometown.
I yell "Windsor, Ontario" right over the top of "South Detroit." I'm going to tell my wife to buy me this shirt.
I yell "That's Downriver!" The *impressive* part is that now my husband does too, and he's German.
So does my partner. He's Australian and absolutely loves that I taught him that. We live in Australia as well, so when he says it in public, if people hear him they're a bit confused.
[deleted]
OMG, I thought I was the only one that did that!  Hysterical!
My fiancée too
Downriver
Wyandotte checking in
Same (Trenton)! Lol!
Lincoln Park here...after 55 miserable years in Commiefornia, now Ontonagon!!
Love this!
Except that south Detroit still means the southern part of Detroit, not south *of* Detroit
Sure, we can do that.

Any way you want it.
I see what you did there 👀
"It's OOR taint, ok? Sorry."
Should have thrown in an “eh”
I have this same shirt, it’s from ink detroit store in hazel park. When people see it, most don’t get it. Love it!😆
The hang up is that anyone “Born and raised” in Detroit would never call it South Detroit. So the song lyrics don’t make sense to locals. If you’re from the area, the southernmost part of Detroit is called “Detroit” or “downtown”. If you were “born and raised” south of downtown you would say you were Canadian (straight south is the Detroit River with Canada on the south side), or you’re from “Downriver” because all of the areas southwest of Detroit are along the river after it turns south. For comparison, Chicago has “south side” and “north side” and “western suburbs”, but no one from Chicago says they are from “East Chicago” — that’s Lake Michigan.
Yeah this is honestly one of the things that Detroiters get hung up on for no reason that bugs me. 

Every plot of land has a southern part. For Detroit, that is just downtown. Just because it isn’t a city like Chicago that has a “South Side” doesn’t mean there isn’t a southern part.
I agree 😅
Exaaactly! I always thought Detroiters being weird about the South Detroit line was silly.

Everywhere you go has a North, South, East and West part. There is a Southern side of my house, for example. Just because I can keep going South and hit my neighbor's house doesn't mean that South Myhouse isn't there.
Gotta tell my Journey story.  In the early 1980s, The Rolling Stones were coming to New York City and I was unemployed, so I sent out a few dozen requests for the tickets.  If your request was drawn, you were mailed instructions for how to buy them.  I did get ONE chance to buy two tickets and did so.  I learned later how much my husband’s coworker wanted to see the Stones, so I let him go with my husband, instead of going myself.  How did he repay me?  He bought four tickets to take us to see Journey!  Since they were coming with us, we couldn’t just stay home and say we went, we had to actually GO.
No, it’s Windsor.
Actually you're kind of wet.
Eastern Market
What a terribly ignorant thing to say.
Yes it is. Look at the map.
Yes it is
LOL.
Projection.
Which is, every damn time.
[deleted]
Please look into Detroit Bus Company and/or Detroit History Tours. They both have super cool informative 3-hr tours of Detroit. We just went on one over the weekend and we went to three of the oldest bars and learned about each. Jimmy Hoffa used to make phone calls from a phone booth that still exists inside Nancy Whiskeys for example. You won’t regret it.
It’s not really an “inside joke” here unless your name is Steve Perry and you can’t think of anything else that rhymes with the word “boy”.
I didn’t know it was a joke, but I do know they play it at every sports event, and maybe even in intermissions at concerts? I’ve lived here for like, 10-12 years, but I don’t get to get out and do a whole lot
Or the smell of wine and cheap perfume.
I’m from Wyandotte. I always thought it meant Downriver.
I'm slow tonight. That's something you better believe.
I have to know, please. What song?
That’s Southwest of Detroit.
Maybe southwest?
Typically when something is considered "south (city)" is because it's south of the city center. If you look on a map, Windsor is directly south of Detroit's city center. Wyandotte is not directly south, it's more southwest.
Me too!
Southgate!
Hello my fellow Trentoniter, Trentonian, Trentongander, Trentonite, Trentistanian.....I give up.
Raised 🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️
Can I have the money you used to live in that horrible place?
The hang up is that anyone “Born and raised” in Detroit would never call it South Detroit. So the song lyrics don’t make sense to locals. If you’re from the area, the southernmost part of Detroit is called “Detroit” or “downtown”. If you were “born and raised” south of downtown you would say you were Canadian (straight south is the Detroit River with Canada on the south side), or you’re from “Downriver” because all of the areas southwest of Detroit are along the river after it turns south.

Except that when the song was written, he wasn't talking about southern Detroit.
There is no southern part of Detroit, central Detroit is the southernmost part of Detroit and Windsor was almost named south Detroit and is still referred to as south Detroit whether related to the song or otherwise. The song is a mess up but the place south Detroit is either fictional or windsor, not southern detroit.
Will they see the lights go down in the city?
Oh shit thank you so much. I'm going to pick one up
Ugh! You did him a favor with the Stones and then he turns around and does you like that!?
“No one got it” is a projection. 🤷‍♂️
Luckily in my hometown I have two options for trains from Chicago that stop in my city. Wolverine and Blue Water. I feel like I have always had better luck with BW than W
Yeah, you can be north of Canada in Detroit, and you can be south of Mexico in Yuma AZ.  There are other places this applies, but those are the ones I've been to.
Haha yeah i listened to the song and understand it now. I grew up in NYC and Seattle and I would've never understood this reference and I doubt many people in those areas would either. Not many of us understand nuanced Michigan geography until it's relevant to you
Long before Journey existed, the question was *If you get in a plane in Detroit and fly due south, what's the first forign country you fly over?*

I need that shirt!!!
With South Park font
So if you are in the center of Detroit and look south your not looking at south Detroit?  Every city has a south side even Detroit.
I have to double check, but I'm not sure Steve actually wrote the song lyrics or music. I think it was Jonathan Cain. Regardless, the fact that he never suggested another rhyme while recording the song is telling. I'm sure plenty of people of pointed this out to members of the band ove the years. Perry was a replacement anyway, so he may not have felt comfortable making that kind of suggestion. I only know this info not because I'm any big Journey fan but because of all the recent legal drama with the band, so I'm starting to notice all the trivia about them.
Nah, this is definitely still a thing. 
(Not me. But Hazel Park is close enough and it’s definitely there.)
>that’s something you better believe.

Oh I won’t. I was told long ago…Don’t Stop Believing
It's cool. It's been kind of a lazy day, and the weather isn't helping.
"Don't Stop Believin'" by Journey
Downvote my previous comment to oblivion. I'm tired and was a bit slow.
It’s funny because there is no SOUTH DETROIT that would be Canada.
[deleted]
Still there?
Trentontoner!! 🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️
linguistics is the best thing ever
Calling it horrible is way too kind. Good riddance to the west coast and too many decades of working too hard to barely get by.
Actually, East Chicago is literally a city in Indiana.
Because he didn’t know jack about Detroit, not because he meant Canada.

>Perry cowrote “Don’t Stop Believin’” with guitarist Neal Schon and keyboard player Jonathan Cain. As he explained to Library of Congress writer/editor Neely Tucker, he’d noticed a directional sign for I-75 that featured South on one line and Detroit on the next, and assumed that was a place or a district or at least something more concrete than Oz.
Literally every plot of land has a southern part. 

Yes, Steve Perry was just making a song and knew nothing about Detroit, but that doesn’t change the fact that every city has a north/ south/east/west.
How could a place possibly not have a southernmost point(s)? That’s what being a place is.
Sure there is a south Detroit. It borders the area of Melvindale and Lincoln Park.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit#/map/0
Hahaha, no.
It’s just Delray. Have you even driven down there?
[deleted]
My silly self forgot to grab it when I had the chance, so I ordered it from their website lol. I thought surely I needed a comfy shirt showing the love for both places. With the added twist of the song joke, an instant classic tee haha! 🇨🇦🙌🇺🇸
I live in Washington and I’m farther north than most Canadians
But the song is Iconic
If you leave from DTW you won’t hit Canada going south.
You would see downtown, then the river, then Canada. There really is no south Detroit.
Thank you
Thank you. Took my way too long to figure out lol.
Been there
Usually people distinguish southwest as a separate geographical area. There isn't any area that is known as south Detroit even of there are areas that are south of Detroit. I mean, we are considered a "midwest" state even if we are more east than west. 
I'm very adept at linguistics, some might even say "cunning". Sometimes I'll put the two together and have a really good time.......cunning-linguistically speaking.
😆
Which is really West Gary!
Antarctica would like to have a word. 

/s
Look at Detroit on a map and tell us what is due south of the RenCen. Across the river is “South Detroit”
Except it's never called that. That's Downriver and the area above is called Southwest or West Side.
If you look at a map, Delray is south west Detroit.  Inside Detroit, going due south, you hit the river and then Canada, mostly Windsor.
Uh… no. Dearborn is almost due west. Curse this sub for not allowing images.
But can you look to the south and see Canadians?
At the time the question was current, Detroit City Airport, now Coleman A. Young International Airport was a fully active, commercial airport.
There is no ***neighborhood*** named South Detroit. There is literally a South of any given city or other contiguously defined geographical area. But don’t let pedantry get in the way of good memes.
“You would see downtown” which is southern Detroit.
Michigan was a Midwest state, about 170 years ago. Strange how old descriptions persist. Today Michigan is an Eastern North Central state.
Nothing in Detroit is south of the RenCen…thus the area that the RenCen is in (aka downtown) is South Detroit.  You can't just claim a different city as your own.  It would be like calling Ypsi "East Ann Arbor."
Yep. Google Pt Roberts WA. You gotta drive through Canada to get there, or take a ferry.
Not this argument again. 🤦🏽‍♀️ No, there is no South Detroit. No, nobody says they are going to South Detroit. No one considers us as having a south side. There are areas with names - Corktown, Boston Edison, Brush Park, Indian Village, etc - but there is no mindset of a “south” Detroit. South Detroit is Windsor, Ontario, Canada.
Right, but we are still considered the Midwest region. That's what I'm saying, that the way things are described and categorized are not always based on technicalities. Just like there's no region of Detroit considered South Detroit, Michigan is considered a Midwest state. 
![gif](giphy|PrCKC4buWwpsQ)

Is this your tactic? You argue until the other person wants to bang her head on a table?
Well, I did say it applied in other places.
I said there are no neighborhoods called South Detroit and your “retort” is to just list neighborhood names?

if you’re on the River downtown, what side of Detroit are you on? Like, in reference to Cardinal directions?

Calling it an argument at all is a misnomer. It’s an objective byproduct of a consistent geographical taxonomy. There is no argument.
I'm not "arguing" lmao just saying facts.  Sorry you didn't take a geography class in high school.
Never said you didn’t, friend. Maybe I should have put an exclamation mark or something on it cuz I was just adding to the weird geography facts
On the river downtown is central Detroit. It is the epicenter. Everything radiates outward to the southwest, west, north, and northeast. Due south is Canada.
I know you can do it in western New York, too.  There are also a couple places along the Rio Grande in Texas where you can be south of Mexico as well.  It's one of those jokes that when I say it my kids roll their eyes.  That's half the fun in saying it.
Check the map again. Granted, just making things up out of whole cloth is the only thing you can really do when arguing with a pedant, but that doesn’t mean I’ll let them fly unchallenged.

And honestly, even if you were right, that would just move South Detroit further downriver. You really can’t win here.
Non-Michigander here.  Had some friends from up there swear up and down that Michigan has the best hotdog in the world and I did not believe them.  I was wrong.
Finally ordered some Koegels natural casing Viennas (even got the shirt as a joke for my buddies) and did a taste test with manwich style and Koegels chili topping style.  I am upset at just how good they are it’s not even fair.  Best hotdogs in the world.  
Welcome. Spread the word among the unfortunate. Serve the curve.
Oh yeah. Wait until you try coney sauce on one. *chefs kiss*
Living outside Michigan, I can tell you why Michigan has the best hotdogs. Michigan has strict rules on hotdogs. No filler meat or, as I say, not filled with lips and assholes. I don't care if you want just ketchup on your hotdog or some fancy sauce with chili it just tastes better with a natural dog instead of the Frankenweenie other states pass off as hotdogs
Throw some chili sauce, diced union and mustard you got yourself a coney baby.
Yes, we have the holy trinity of hot dogs here in Michigan. Kowalski, Dearborn brand, Koegels.
My family used to hand out Koegels on the Au Sable river to canoers/kayakers/tubers in the Roscommon area every July. It was so neat seeing folks relaxing their way down the river and spotting my grandpa's cabin where we had a grill on the deck and a big "FREE HOTDOGS" sign. My grandpa passed away a few years ago and we had to sell his cabin. I'm hoping to buy it back someday and get that tradition going again.
The best part is that in Michigan we don't care what you choose to put on your hotdog. There may be preferred suggestions but You will not see any temper tantrums for using ketchup or whatever the hell you want like you see the people of Chicago do.
Now you need to have a Flint coney to make your life complete.
Now try a Dearborn frank
 Never doubt a Michigander, pal.
Michigan really has some great food but seems to fly under the radar for a lot of the country. Pizza, Coney/Hot dogs, Chips, Pop, etc all have great offerings in Michigan and that doesn't include all of the individual recipes and stuff.
You need to get some proper coney sauce.
Lmfao, you may not be from Michigan, but you have the most Michigan facial expression ever in that Pic and I love it.
When I lived in CA, no one knew what a coney dog was, so I made them with hormel sauce from the grocery, which also was near impossible to find…

People were disgusted! 😆 they seriously thought I was a lunatic making that food. Fuk em’

Also, these same people put olives and carrots in their spaghetti sauce, so… Fuk em’
This is the content I'm here for.
Koegel’s is probably the best I’ve ever had.
If there's one thing Michiganders know, it's their weiner!
Need some Better Made chips and some Vernors or Faygo to go with it 👍🏼
Well I am a bit older and I can still smell the tiger stadium dogs. With the dude heaving the box with the steamed buns and yummy dogs. Gimme 2 with mustard! Man those were the days! They suck now.
Lifelong Michigander who moved to Texas in 2023. Kogels are not available here and it BLOWS.
Need a can of Vernor’s to wash it down.
Koegel's are the best! I have my parents ship them down to me in Atlanta!
Go to Yesterdog in East Grand Rapids. Immediately.
You need to try Vollwerths from the UP. Best hotdogs I've ever eaten in my life.
Vollwerths>Koegels.
I’m in North Carolina,grew up close to flint. For years I had a friend here that was from Saginaw and she would drive up to visit and bring back  Koegels.  But  NOW——there’s a company that does “Koegles on the Road.” They drive a tractor trailer down south loaded with Koegels stuff, Pinnconing cheese, Faygo, Better Made chips.  They will be near me in September.  😍.  Maybe they will be close to YOU. Google them.
You look like a mix of Michael Scott tobey McGuire and a third famous person I can't put my finger on
Cheese on your coney dog? This is why people get shot in Detroit. Find new friends before they get you into trouble.
I’m so happy for you!!! What a great day! Good chili:cheese:onion ratio you have on those there too. 

Might have to get to a coney this week now. Thanks for making this post!
Michigan has endless award winning restaurants if any one cares to know! Dogs, Burger, fish frys, BBQ and even Chinese food. And I don't just say that because I grew here lol. None are 5 star restaurants, usually just small local joints with and for some reason really good food!
Try some Midwestern brats and polish sausages too. Wisconsin may be more popular but Michigan can tube up some tasty treats. Just my preference over a standard dog.
I see what are clearly Koegels passed off in neighboring state restaurants as the best hot dogs without giving credit where credit belongs. They simply import them as their own. 

Anyway Koegels with Flint style Coney Hot Dog Chili is where it's at.
Fuck, I love this state.
ONLY mustard, chili and onions for a real coney !
Where’s the coney sauce from?
Now try Kowalski.
Ya love to see another convert.
Yeah.

We don’t mess around with our hot dogs…. 😆
Kowalski, then Dearborn for me. Natural skin casing, of course. It's gott have the snap! 🫰
Their pickled bologna are great sliced on a cracker with some cheese.
Oh good you even ate them the way they are intended to be eaten, hopefully you used no beans
You’re welcome.
Wait til you have detroit style pizza, my friend.
Koegels skinless are my personal fav!
Split top bun, minced onions, pinconning sharp cheddar,  skyline chili sauce, and koegel hot dog. Sometimes a little mustard. Don't at me. Best combo out there.
Get Coney'd, Out of Towner! 

For real though, we got some mad hotdogs. The Kogel Factory is in flint, those dogs are high quality, far better than the other brands that imitate. Regular, skin-on Viennas are the ultimate, and they sell them in huge crates if you want.
Hell yea, it ain’t a coney if u ain’t got koegels
Oh, Lord, now I want to try some. I have no plans to go to MI anytime soon, sadly.
He's....learning...
Love me some G&L hotdogs.
Thought that was Jake Gyllenhaal for a second
So that makes it the best sandwich in the world or no?
I mean this as a compliment - you look like suburban Justin Theroux. Anyone else immediately think this?
Nothing beats Koegel Viennas.  The best.
Sometimes I just crave a coney dog. It was a staple for school lunches when I was a kid.
You’re damn right you were wrong. Glad you learned the error of your ways. Now go have a Vernors and enjoy your coney.
Yesterdog in Grand Rapids needs to be on the bucket list
Yeah man koegels are life changing, then you can also make kegel jokes so it’s a win win.
Yes, we do. We’re hotdog kings with the hotdog people that take hotdogs and eat them and do things to them to make them taste better like put cheese in the middle. Yeah you haven’t tried that. Yeah, that’s Midwest classic.
Flint coneys are the best. Everything else is just a chili dog.
You need Vernor's as well
I sometimes fend about what will I do if I have to leave Michigan and not be able to get Koegels all beef hot dogs, probably not eat hot dogs again.
you look like a Meijer brand Jake Gyllenhaal
Michigan food is criminally underrated
Get yourself some coney sauce from the dirtiest, sun-faded sign, hole in the wall coney shop you can find and enjoy carnal coney bliss.
Now just wash them down with Vernors.
I've never heard of this before ever. Just ordered a shipment to Texas, so we shall see.
Get a Flint-style coney with Koegels and you've reached the top of the mountain.  Everything else after that is just a chili-dog
The small intestines of sheep.
That’s what makes them good. 
And that’s what they use for the casing. 
Koegel Viennas
Kogels is the best
YES!! I love the viennas!
Welcome to the Koegels cult!

![gif](giphy|PudZiAbQDUEik|downsized)
Nice shirt.
God bless flint michigan Vogel hot dogs 🌭!!!!
Koegel's Vienna's RULE!
Kogel dogs roasted over a campfire is my favorite way to cook them, try it if you can!
I bought the book[, 'The Flint Coney - A Savory History' by Dave Liske.  I encourage everyone to buy the book and support the author. ](https://www.arcadiapublishing.com/products/9781467150460) Y[ou can also buy it in a Kindle version on Amazon.](https://www.amazon.com/Flint-Coney-Savory-History-American/dp/1467150460)

He shares the recipes for:  Flint Coney Spice Blend, restaurant preparation using the 25 pound bag of Abbot's Coney Meat (with the suggestion of breaking that down into 25 1 pound bags and how to prepare 1 bag amounts of coney meat.  He debunks the recipe that's made the rounds where you add ground hotdogs into the coney mix, has the recipe for Flint Coney Sauce From Beef Hearts (the author's own version), The FLint Coney "Holy Grail": That Recipe For Macedonian Goulash, Gillie's Flint Coney Island Hot Dog Chili Topping - with a home version of their coney island sauce, and a few other versions.

I won't share the recipe here because I don't have the author's permission and I don't want to take money out of his wallet by sharing his work and research.
If you get a chance, go to Yesterdog in Grand Rapids. I took an old boyfriend once & he was shocked when I ordered 3 … he ended up eating 9 - and we were not drunk or hungover. They are just normal size, dirty water hot dogs, but for some reason they are fucking delicious.

ETA: while you’re in GRap - find a good Polish deli and get some real kielbasa while you’re there. If you’ve never had it, you won’t understand what I mean, just trust me. And it must be par boiled, then cut in half and pan fried with a ketchup & German mustard mixture for dipping along with a little extra horseradish. You should also have thin sliced no seed rye with butter and German potato salad.
lol sorry for the rant
Bro now you gotta get coney sauce from Jackson, Mi. It's where the first coney island restaurant ever opened. You boiling them dogs right?!
Well I’m sorry to inform you but coney dogs aren’t supposed to have cheese on them. Chili, onions and mustard, that’s it.
_One of us!  One of us!_
I hated hot dogs growing up because all we ate was boiled generic dogs for easy family meals every now and then growing up in NC. My girlfriend grew up in NW MI, and I was baffled (and slightly appalled) when I first learned hot dogs were one of favorite foods.

After living up here the past few years, I have learned Michigan is superior to everywhere else when it comes to hot dog culture.

Whenever I head back South, my dad always request a hefty order of dogs and brats from Gabe’s in Maple City.
You’ve just made Cincinnati Coneys using different products.
Koegels is the bomb!
Ever had a Flint style coney? No onions with mustard and the beef chunk sauce  it's so amazing!
One must center slice a dog prior to grilling.     Melt the cheese over the center for completion then top.       Koegels only here.
Wait until you try a Vollwerths natural fading hot dog.
So the hot dog itself is the best or how they cook it? Is it a special bun? Do the topping matter? I feel like a polish dog is the best hotdog so I’m curious.
I'm going to assume you've never had Hoffmann’s.
It’s true
Koegels are the best. Make some chili sauce and you’re golden
I'm a local and have only had that brand maybe once 

Now I gotta do a chili cheese hot dog tonight with em. Thank you for the inspiration
Shhhh
I upvote for shameless pandering
exercise your koegels!
“Serve the curve” sounds like what you do when it’s time for the hot dogs to exit your body.
I’m glad you’ve reoriented yourself back to reality. Yup, pretty good.
Koegel’s delivery truck arrive down south this week?
Koegels are the best!!!
Making my mouth water! It's so sad that hot dogs aren't healthy food. 😢😏
Add some ketchup, shredded dill pickle and sauerkraut and it’d be perfect. Maybe some jalapeño relish too.
THIS GUY HAS OHIO WRITTEN ALL OVER HIM!  GET HIM FELLAS!
You’ve got to try a Flint coney. It’s crumbled ground beef without the chili sauce. Delectable.
Looks like you went with the classic Detroit style coney with the soupier chili. Now you can try Flint style which is a spicy meat topping with less moisture.

Have fun and top it off with a Boston cooler

If you're ever in the Lansing area you need to try Spartys coney island. They make both sauces so you can mix and match.
We know our wieners here.
mustard and onions for the purest. 

But chili cheese dogs are good too.
Cool video on [Michigan hot dogs](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=DslHsK8d9Dc)
We need to campaign Koegals viennas best American hot dog period.
Try koegels frankfurters. Hands down the best hot dog.
Put plain yellow mustard on that and... it gets even better.
Never caught on with me. I do like the pickled red hots and their ring bologna and once in a blue moon I’d try some braunschweiger.
Just wait till you've had Dearborn, or even better, Kowalski.
Coney Island Dogs are the best hot dogs I've had, but then again I don't go asking for a hot dog when I visit other places 😂
These are my 2nd favorite.  My favorite is the Dearborn 1904 brand
Get your ass over here to Starlite Diner in Flint and try our Flint style Coney dog
Koegel Viennas are the best.   I am eating one now.   Having grown up in Flint it is the only hot dog I will eat!
That's not a hotdog lol it's just chili in a bun.
Best dogs and best coneys in the US
Grew up around Flint, if it’s not a Koegel I’m not interested lol. Be right back need an Angelo’s coney!!!
Rusty Dogs in northern MI is so good
I prefer a Colombian hotdog or a Chicago Dog (as long as they are beef).  Didn’t know that there was such thing as a “Michigan hot dog”
My michigan native girlfriend has been swearing this is true. I’m struggling to come to terms with it but we’re moving up soon. I’ll happily eat my words along with Michigan’s apparently incredible hotdogs.
In NY we literally just call the best hotdogs “Michigans.”
Pick yaself up, hop in your car, drive to Lipuma’s. If there is a line, endure. Get coneys, chili cheese fries, and a chicago dog. If something else catches your eye (unless it’s the tacos), give it a shot. So good.
The cheese is a tad excessive, but chili, onions and mustard with the hot dog that goes pop is religion in Michigan
Nothing bets a couple coney dogs and a Boston cooler
If you ever get a chance, go to American coney Island in Detroit. Those are some tasty coney dogs
Before you eat them you can use them to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles. Go Koegels! Serve the Curve!
Wait till you have a Lafayette Coni Island
Gotta hit it with that mustard next time to get the true coney dog experience
Flint/Detroit style coney sauce is seriously the best dog on the planet. The beef heart base makes a huge difference over every other style of chili dog sauce.
Alright, I'm sold. From out of state too, and when I heard that one of the signature dishes here was a hot dog, I was a bit dismissive. Will try hotdogs in EL when I get the chance.
Serve the curve! Take that Peyronie’s disease!
Don’t forget a faygo red pop to go with it
Now, next step is to come to Detroit and go to American Coney Island, Lafayette Coney, and finish with the best Coney you've ever had at Dulys.
We know our weiners sir! 🤣🤣😂😂 🌭🌭
yup detroit invented the coney dog.
Got a fryer?

That looks pretty good.
Made in Flint Michigan! They smoke them there too. Many years ago I was shown how they make them.
Not a hotdog, but I’m also a big fan of Kiolbassa beef sausages and polish sausages. They’re out of San Antonio I believe. Seen them at Costco/Sams Club.
The Detroit style coney dog uses a chili with Greek influences… such as Cinnamon. Depending where you go it’s different. In Detroit American and Lafeyette are the two oldest known. However Flint has its own chilli dog that unique.
Next get a ring bologna and pan fry it.
That cheese feels like a sin, tho.
Koegels are rad
Coney dogs are the best ever.
This is the way.
I’d go the Dearborn Sausage route…just saying
Fkkkk, I was over in Wisconsin for 5 years and never made it over to MI. We were going to go a midwestern tour to find out who had the best chili dogs before we had to move. 

Gonna see if I can have some Koegel’s shipped to CO to give em a test
Every guy on this site with a beard makes the same face when they post a pic of themselves
I saw your other post in r/hotdogs and now the algorithm recommended this subreddit. So I guess I’ll be seeing stuff from r/Michigan for a while until I mute it. The algorithm is so weird sometimes
I am from Flint and now live in Kalamazoo. Whenever I get back to home it includes a trip to Starlite for a coney Yum 😋
KV's are the absolute best natural cased dog on the market.
Thanks to this post I might look for some at meijer
Welcome friend. I love Dogapolyspe 2024, what a fun idea & pace yourselves. Somewhere - maybe in r/hotdogs, was a infographic of all different types of Michigan only different city coney styles. As a born & raised Detroiter who has lived in several cities in the state - I learned something new through that image! I’ll try to find it but you might find it faster searching something like “cool guide to Michigan hot dogs or Michigan coneys”.
I love those, with some Tony Packo’s chili dog sauce, mustard, onions, and cheese.
😆
Happiness, fall in love travel the world do all the things you think you should have done.  Life is amazing. We all may just have five years to live. You’ll never know.  Live love and cherish.
Gotta love that Michigan meat
Ben’s chili dog!  Best!
I'll never forget the first hot dog I ever had outside the state of Michigan. It was a weird, unnatural neon pink color, even though it wasn't a red-hot.  There was no texture to speak of. No skin, just mush. It was too straight, and weirdly short. I must have blocked out my memory of the flavor of the flavor, if it had one at all...


Truly traumatizing. I had no idea other states had it so bad.
All other hotdogs are trash.
With Gracie's Coney Sauce...a dream combo!
*facts.

 I was just up there last weekend and thought about taking some back with me. Couldn't find a suitable way to transport. 🤦‍♂️
Carmelized onions and Dijon mustard is my fave, YUM
If you think you’d like it mustard those dogs and that’s a 100% Detroit coney.
OP, there is a place in Mt Pleasant called Dog Central, they make so many different variations on hot dogs. It's chef's kiss place to eat some amazing hotdogs! And never any judgement on how you like your dog. Worth the trip!
Born and raised in Detroit and damn proud of it. Lived in seven states in this country in 55 years. Michigan has the best Damn Coney Island hotdogs on the planet. Period.
 O4 k
D d on her on 3 o psssddpo3o9 y 393k
Ooo oljpj4 Ooo o4ij4ojok4 o 9 as o4f
Yes! A believer!  The holy grail of hot dogs.
Anybody remember the hotdogs stands outside Kroger stores.pretty sure the coney were 50cents and legit kogeols. Probably harmed my overall health during that wonderful period
Order National Coney Island's "Coney Kit" shipped to your door. 
-Big Coney
red hot tho dog from Dearborn is INSANEEEEEEEEEE at least to me it is
I have never tried a coney dog and I literally never will.
They go best grilled with just mustard and onion and to drink, a Vernors.
Just wait til you try Detroit style pizza 🤯
Damn Daddy. What’s your OF link? 🥵
Love that ‘snap’ 🌭
Viennas are the best and they’re not hot dogs.
Best ever!
Be careful. Coney island restaurants are how I gained 60 lbs. Chilli and cheese fries are wonderful.
Dearborn brand natural casing hotdogs are really good too
This is the way!
Yesterdog
I'm Michiganian
Where can you get these?
Oh yeah.  Koegels viennas are the best around.  I wish I could find the coney topping available, though.  The one in the red chub is just chili sauce, and I find the one in the yellow chub to be far superior. 

Meijer and Kroger said koegels doesn't produce the yellow wrapped coney sauce anymore.  

Has Koegels of Flint Michigan lost the perspective of what the people of Genesee county want and need?

Koegels really forked the goose on that one.
Try skyline chili coneys, you’ll be thrilled.
Koegals are the greatest hotdog to grace this earth and it's a crime that it's mainly a Michigan thing. Fuckin love the originals and chicken versions.
well buddy i can tell that is canned chilli....get that nasty ass shit out of here....thats a not a real hotdog...u can tell you from up north
People from Chicago, Mexico, Iceland and probably a bunch of other places be like “meet in the parking lot” right now haha
From an outsider, it's the second best hot dog behind an Icelandic dog.
Yeah Bitch! You take that hot dog and like it!!!
We dogging
That’s because in Michigan you can’t have pig parts in a hotdog. It must be of a certain cut
True.  And very close is Saelens from Buffalo,  our sister city.
Is that a coney or a hotdog
I’ve heard tales of wonder from Iceland.
But have you ever tried a Chicago dog? Bc if you haven’t, let me tell you that those dogs, like their pizza, are fkn stupid.
Cinci > MI
They are the best!!! Will not buy anything else!!
Not the best by far. I had my best in Belgium, portugal and Germany
Currently on a 15 person family trip to Tennessee. We brought two 4 pound packs of dogs

Kind of seems ridiculous typing that out
Sam club’s hot dogs look better than that.
I went to university in upstate NY, really far up north. Montreal was 60 miles away, and 20 of that was to the Canadian border. We had multiple places in towns that sold Michigans, which were essentially Coneys. So NY, selling midwestern hot dogs named after a classic NY dog. Amazing, loved every one
Just made two this evening. I try not to have it much for health reasons, but every now and then as a treat can't hurt, right? So satisfying.
I travel to Michigan often. I bring back a family pack of them every time
Koegel dogs >>>>>>> all other contenders
Ahhh it’s true. And trying to explain this to anyone out of state just diminishes your education effort
Now it's time for a detroit and flint style coney
Now get them grilled properly on a flat top to get that SNAP when you bite in.
We do have a law about hotdogs and what can be used in them.  We know what’s important in life and we protect it!
Awesome.

Now go to Starlite and get a REAL Flint Coney.

Koegel Vienna with Coney sauce, mustard and diced onions.
it's prudent to wrap Koegals in bacon, then make it a chilli dog.
Only better if they are Koegel's specifically. At least in my experience, lol.
I moved to Michigan in March, and my first Coney was a religious experience.
Born and raised in Michigan, have lived all over since becoming an adult. Michigan hasn’t discovered Sonoran dogs yet, that’s why they still think they’re the best
Anything has to top the abomination that is Cincinnati's famous Skyline Chili dogs.

If I want to eat that much cinnamon, I'll stop at a doughnut shop.
Damn, I've sworn by Nathan's for years. Haven't been able to find them in natural casing though since I was a kid. Guess I'm gonna need to try ordering some Koegels.
You need a flint Michigan coney ( which is where the company was started and still is in Flint today) the sauce isn't runny like the Detroit coneys. worked with people from Detroit, once they tried the Flint one, there was no going back to the Detroit coneys.
I strongly believe in steamed bun, koegel dog, chili sauce, diced onions, and a semi- thick line of mustard. Absolutely no variation.

I'm from Jackson,  MI, so I prefer the chili to be less watery.

For reference: Jackson coney Island, Virginia coney Island,  Andy's Pizza, Jackson Pizza Factory, Christoffs.
I see you've never been to a Chicago-area Home Depot
Oh god. I love koegel’s dawgs so much. 🤤
My guy that's a chilli dog, invented and perfected in Cincinnati.
*squints chicagoan eyes*
I’m so happy you got to experience our top notch wieners. If you go to Champaign Illinois there’s a dive fast food joint that is almost on the same level. Jurassic grill. Lifetime Michigander here (minus 2 years when I lived in central Illinois) those almost made hot dogs ok out there.
nice lil setup I see coming along the keyboard and headset lol
🌭 🌭 👀
Pretty hard to beat Koegel Vienna's.
I like the Keogel skinless beef franks.

Apparently the Meijer house bnand beef hotdogs are good as well.

Dearborn brand are good as well.
If that’s a Chilli Cheese dog….. sorry buddy, come to Texas and see what real chilli with all beef Nolan Ryan dogs are all about!
I married someone from the “other” side of the state. Being from Flint, it was sacrilegious to have anything but a Koegel dog. My husband said they were overrated and introduced me to Chicago style hot dogs. He was right about Koegel’s! Now we only buy Hebrew Nationals and will go out of our way for a Chicago style dog.
Flint dog or Detroit dog?
Swallow that sausage wrongboy.
Koegels are the absolute best.  Love the snap!
Growing up we went to lipumas in Rochester. No idea if they are still there but they had a line down the street and afterwards you go sit outside watching the cars at Dairy Queen.
Koegels are epic!
My toppings are mustard, onions and sauerkraut. Yummy. 😋
Yep. Koegals will ruin hotdogs for you. Because now everywhere you go and eat a hotdog, you're going to be disappointed and just wish it was a Koegal. That pop when you bite thru the casing!? So satisfying.
Drop a block of velvetta in your chili.  You're welcome.
Depends on the restaurant serving them
Where did you buy it from?
Repost this to r/hotdog
Where did you get those in the pic? They look like G&L Chili dogs that I miss sooooo much…(and I’m vegetarian and grew up in MI)
Made the silly mistake of living in another state for many years with no koegels and it was awful, never found a good hotdog.  Every visited to MI included a Meijers run to snag as many Koegels pkgs as we could to bring home.  They are the BEST!
Now somebody get this man to Flint so he can enjoy a Big John's #7 with a bunch of red sauce on the side. Once he finishes that, it's time to get him to Haloburger so he can wash down all that deliciousness with a Boston Cooler.

His assimilation shall be complete.
Flint's best.
Michigander living in Chicago: god how I miss my coney dogs. Wash’em down with a Vernor’s or a Faygo.
I dare you find a better dog than a coney dog
Currently live in Michigan and am originally from buffalo, wardynskis >
Native Michigander. Yes our hotdogs are great, but they would be much better if we dressed them like they do in Iceland. I think about Icelandic hotdogs with too much regularity.
Fun story. I used to work at a retail store in Michigan. One of the Koegel family members came in. At that time, I have never even tried one.

When I took his name and number he seemed shocked that I didn't recognize the name.  We got to talking, and a week later he came back in and gave me 20 packs of the things. I still prefer Nathan's, but Koegel is a close second.

As an aside, Dearborn brand are also fantastic, and also from Michigan.
Honorary Michigander
Try the thick cut bologna, pickled bologna, and dinner franks too. Koegels doesn’t miss!
Lipuma's Coney Island
Give me your philly/philly suburbs hot dog picks???
One of us! One of us! One of us! 😂
America’s “High Five” with the Great Lakes, Up North, four seasons (especially Fall) and great food (pizza, coney hot dogs, pasties) and limited severe weather.  Other states dealing with wildfires, hurricanes, and tornadoes (and weather induced power outages.  And while many states in the West have to deal with water shortages that will only get worse in the future, we have a tremendous resource of the Great Lakes.  Hopefully, the Great Lake states and Canada continue to protect this important resource as “fresh water” will become a critical commodity in the future.
Those are the second best.  Detroit style.  The number one slot goes to flint style coney
Yes, Koegels are THE BEST HOTDOG and I am willing to die on that hill. Used to work near the koegels plant on Bristol in flint. Served many many of them at the DQ on Bristol when I was a kid. All other hot dogs are a cheap imitation.
Love a good coney
I'm originally from Michigan so I've been spoiled with coney islands and amazing hot dogs, but don't sleep on Tony Packo's in Toledo. 

Dogs are on par with Detroit, but they kill us in the pickles and relish category.
no cheez in ThE D brah
I agree these are the best hot dogs, but have trouble convincing some friends to try them because if the natural casing.
No cheese
I’m from the U.P. And did NOT know we apparently have the best hotdogs! I know Vollwerth’s is much beloved by many but this is the first I’ve heard of any Michigan company being claimed the BEST. I have to try these!
We do some awesome Wet Burritos too and have no idea why
I'm salivating at the thought of Michigan coneys
Did you have Detroit Coney's or Flint Coney's?  There is a difference.  Flint Coney's have Koegels Vienna hot dogs which are Kosher, no bad byproducts.  They have a little snap when you bite into them but the taste is unbelievable.
We call them coneys..   Koegel hot dogs are more of a Flint coney with meat sauce and mustard and onion, 

Detroit has their own chili sauce with mustard and onion, and they use whatever hot dog they like personally.  

If you use Ballpark franks..  you suck in my opinion lol  the worst
It’s true, Adam 22.
Try coleslaw on your dog with chili and cheese.
Vienna’s for the win
False. Tony Packos in Toledo.
https://www.facebook.com/DulysConeyIsland

The only Coney Island to go to in Detroit for a real coney
Don’t be afraid to throw some Chicago-style giardiniera on those bad boys!
The slogan makes me laugh.
Now this guy knows how to eat.Kogels has the best hotdogs ever. You can’t have a Coney island without a Kogel hotdog.
From Michigan.. go to a Portillo's and have a Chicago style dog. Detroit does pizza better than Chicago, but Chicago does the hot dog better than Detroit. Dick Portillo didn't create a 33 shop fast food empire on Hot dogs that were even mediocre.. Before I get the downvoted hate.. Eat both, the same day..
Yes. They are superior to all other hot dogs. Now you just have to order National Coney Island Chili and you will have, dare I say, the finest example of a coney dog in the world.
Does Kowalski still make stadium kielbasa?
Glad you learned what’s your favorite topping so far on it?
Damn right you were. 😏
Is that cheese?!?!! ??????
Those are good but I prefer Kowalski
Lol! I knew it was Kogels dogs from just the title!
Koegel Viennas are the absolute BEST! We were in Alaska last month camping and bought Nathan’s and those are horrible. We couldn’t wait to get back to Michigan for our Vienna hotdog. Back in the good ‘ol days our favorite camping feast was Koegel hotdogs and Made-Rite potato chips 😋😋 Sadly, we can’t get Made-Rite potato chips any longer.
If nothing else we have good coney dogs.
Yeah once u eat them u can't ever eat any other hotdogs ever by the way that flint michigan too
I swear by Koegels! They are the only brand I buy anymore. Definitely my favorite hotdog.
And now you’ll never be able to go back to regular ballpark dogs
If you make it to Detroit, visit Lafayette Coney Island downtown. The very best coney dogs!
Already invited people over for dogapolypse 2024,  it’s literally insane how great they are.
I video’d my taste test but couldn’t post videos here so I posted it to the hotdogs sub,  I’m going to try it with just mustard chili and onions today
Serve the curve..Take that Peyronie’s disease!
I served the curve to my wife...Peyronies
Michigan / Detroit coneys are religion.
Looks great 👍
I want to try them every way imaginable.  I ordered their brats,  polish style, and skinless too but the natural casing Viennas have changed my life
Random relatable ADHD story - I was in this small town in Quebec and there was a little takeaway restaurant and on the menu they had a "Michigan hot dog"

It was a hot dog with bolognese sauce. It was like somebody saw a picture of a Coney and then tried to replicate it.
He’s got coneys in the picture lol
Coney sauce my long lost love. Having moved from Detroit to FL there's just no replacing it.
Gotta do flint style if you’re eating a koegel
And if your not from Michigan and just visiting and you see one of the hundreds of “coney island” restaurants in the southeast corner of the state - just know they are Greek restaurants that also serve coney dogs. Also on the menu will be gyros, kebabs, Greek salads, lemon rice soup, saganaki and baklava.
Coney sauce….two words that can make me salivate like Pavlov’s dog.
My parents used to say that too. We always had to go back to Detroit to get any hot dog / bologna products because everything else had “lips, noses and assholes.”

For a while you could get frozen National chili for making coneys at home if you lived in another state (meijers sold it), but I’ve not seen any Detroit chili in a long time.
Michigan purity law of 1516
>not filled with lips and assholes.

We don't get enough Great Outdoors references on Reddit.
That’s what I’m having for breakfast!  I deff prefer it with mustard
Oh my gosh that sounds so good right now I haven't had one like that in over a decade
This is the way.
![gif](giphy|9fBAJu8PJMV4Q|downsized)
No love for Vollwerth's?
Kowalskis are disgusting
Wow I love this idea!  I’m going to do this on the lakefront in honor of your grandpa I’m all about spreading some positivity with hot dogs
That’s an awesome tradition, hope you’re able to continue it one day!
That's amazing. A friend from college used to do the annual Au Sable canoe race. I'll have to ask if they know about the free hotdog cabin.
"I disagree with putting ketchup on a hotdog, but I will fight to the death for you right to do it."- George Washington
True, however the flint vs detroit style argument is very real. (Flint is better of course and I’ll die on that hill)
Hell yeah. No dog discrimination here. Andy why should there be there are so many good options.  Coney, chilli, ketchup and mustard (or either of them by themselves.   I love even weird shit like Coleslaw, sauerkraut, or kimchi.  Fuck it.
Only hot dog elitism I have is you can’t call it a coney if it’s not chili mustard onion. Anything more or less and it’s just a chili dog.
Now that’s just not true. We used to have that hot dog guy at comerica that would refuse ketchup.
>You will not see any temper tantrums for using ketchup or whatever the hell you want like you see the people of Chicago do.

Ha.   


I love Chicago dogs, except I don't, because I'll pick the peppers off, and while the neon relish is.....something, give me dill any day.   


I'm gonna get hate for this, but my preferred toppings are mayo, celery salt, and dill relish.
I was in Chicago with the family on a trip. We stopped at a hotdog stand. The hotdog looked like it left a lot to be desired so i asked for ketchup, too. Dude put like nearly an entire hotdog sized amount of ketchup on top. Not all the food was bad there, but I was definitely happy to get home and eat real food.
Having been to Chicago plenty of times, the whole “Ketchup hate” is extremely exaggerated
Second best part about Michigan is that we are one of the few - if not the only - state that has regulations about what you can and *cannot* put *INSIDE* your hotdog. 

Chew on that. 🌭
There are places in Chicagoland that dont even have catchup for fries. It’s the weirdest gatekeeping thing I have seen
I gotta say, as someone who lived in Chicago for close to 15 years before moving back to Michigan, I have literally never heard anyone who lives in Chicago say shit about how anyone eats their dogs.  A Chicago Style dog doesn't have ketchup on it.  That's it.  But I have actually never heard anyone FROM Chicago say that you shouldn't eat a dog however you want.  Maybe I was just lucky... But every barbeque I went to and every restaurant or coney in the city that I ate at, whether they specialized in hot dogs or not, had ketchup available if you wanted it.
Especially while wearing a Koegels shirt.
Came here to say this
I really wanted to like Dearborn's frank and sausages. The casing is weird. It's like chewing on a condom
Kowalski's too!
Or their pierogis if you’re a fan of those
Dearborn 1904s are incredible.
If it’s anything like these I absolutely will
They eat pork in Dearborn? lol
To further confirm how good Koegel's are?
We'll shoot ya straight
I’ve been told jets deep dish is the next thing I should try I’m not familiar
I did Coney Island inc brand and Koegels chili topping.  I’ve been told I need to try a proper recipe I’m all for making some
I’m from California, I’ve never heard of putting carrots in a marinara or bolognese.  Let alone fucking *olives*.  

Hormel though?  The canned chili? Isn’t that the chili equivalent of chef boyardee?
Mix a cream soda and a red pop and make it a float, or a Boston cooler
Having moved to Texas from Michigan (I moved back after 4 years), you used to be able to order them for delivery to TX. Shipping was like $75 though. I see they don't do it direct anymore, but you have hope. https://koegels.com/how-to-buy-online
[deleted]
This you when you're heading home after visiting family? https://www.facebook.com/share/v/yywPYxzh4ub85AUG/?mibextid=D5vuiz
Still have family here? You can pack things in dry ice and ship it express / next day and it'll survive. My parents send a Koegel's care package to family down in FL every year. One of those styrofoam coolers packed with dry ice and Vienna's, taped up and then packed in another box.
Now that I’ve discovered them I might have to make a trip up north to the promised land and try ALL the hotdogs
Yesterdog is so good. I live out of state now and miss it! I'll have to visit Grand Rapids next time I'm in Michigan
Yesterdogs are objectively not great hotdogs, but they're somehow also the best. It is hard to explain.

When I was born I lived in the apartment above Yesterdog and it's honestly one of the things I miss most about living in GR
Took a girl to Yesterdogs for a first date in the summer of 2004.  I’m a romantic.  

Married for 17 years now.
You’ve piqued my curiosity what is the UP and how do I get them shipped down south
I get Wish version of Jake G sometimes
Henrique Zetterberg maybe
I’m literally about to eat some with just chili topping onions and mustard for breakfast,  I love me some cheese though
Coming from somewhere with some of the best food in the world I’m definitely interested,  we have gas station boudin that’s better than stuff I’ve had in restaurants other places.  If ever you get the chance to come down to Louisiana I’ll make some recommendations
I had the Koegal brats yesterday with kraut and German mustard huge brat fan,  trying their polish sausage tonight!
Best state
It's similar to chili and it goes back to the Greek immigrants that came to Michigan a million years ago (not literally) and they named the restaurants they opened after Coney Island because of reasons and then they started putting this beanless chili sauce on the hot dogs with white onions and mustard and it just tastes correct. 

There's a bunch of places that will ship you their sauce frozen if you want that Michigan hot dog experience at home.
The greatest hotdogs of all time.
Fan for life,  I already reordered enough to share with all my friends the world needs to know these exist
The hot dog itself,  the natural casing has an unbelievable snap (I cooked them on low on a griddler).  I also loved the Michigan toppings of chili sauce (no beans) onions and cheese and tried it coney style today with just chili onions and mustard which were also glorious.  I’m excited to try them all sorts of ways.  I also am a huge fan of polish dogs and got some of Koegels polish to try this weekend
Personally I don't recall ever having Hoffmann's but I shall seek them out because we do like hot dogs in this house but only all beef, natural casing.
I highly recommend the frankfurter over the Vienna. It’s close but koegels frankfurter is the best imo
I had them for breakfast with mustard and they were glorious
“Unique”
You spelled BEST wrong.
Welcome brother 🤝
Koegels chili sauce with mustard on a beef frank is otherworldly good.
Try Kowalski Natural Casing Franks, made in Hamtramk, even  better!
I like onions relish and mustard. As a child I didn't like the natural casing and would peel it off. Lol I've reformed. 🫣
That’s my preferred way. Ketchup for the fries only.
Something about that snap in a Koegel Vienna.
You gotta get their bologna too, slap it on some white bread with mayo and horseradish mustard and sharp cheddar cheese and thank me later
Spiced ground beef "coney" sauce from Abbott's meat in Flint is what gets served on top of a Koegel's Vienna as the best and most traditional Flint-style coney. My personal preference over messy Detroit-style chili dogs.
Virginia Coney Island in Jackson! And Jackson Coney Island! Very good.
The loose hamburger Coney's up here are to die for. I prefer a better mustard than just yellow tho
If you visit Detroit and get the coney sauce, it's made with beef hearts and can't really be replicated at home. It's so fucking good.
Oh no. I am sorry for your experience.

you are welcome.
Mmm I love them with dill relish and Woeber's sweet and spicy mustard!
I always get their products when I travel up north. They're very good, but they don't get a lot of shelf space down state.
Took the words and the dog.... right out of my mouth! UP dogs are superior.
Vollwerth’s hotdogs are the best goddamn hotdogs to ever grace the earth, I will absolutely die on this hill
You seem like an awesome dude. I had a peek at your profile and all of your posts are so fun!

I’ve been on a huge kimchi kick lately and kimchi is now one of my favorite toppings on a hotdog or brat
TIL cabbage is weird
I had a hotdog from a food truck in metro Detroit.  It was a hot dog, followed by mac and cheese, pulled pork, barbecue sauce, and panko breadcrumbs.  Thing was amazing.  Pain to eat, but amazing.
I’m literally eating it this way as I type this just chili topping onion and mustard,  and I prefer it with mustard I think.  I do love me some cheese though
Even weirder, here in Central NY, maybe all of Upstate, is that a coney doesn’t mean chili, mustard, onion, it means a white hot dog made with veal.
I'll take the sport peppers that you don't want!
I assumed I just had bias because I was born and raised in Dearborn and while I like the Flint hot dogs a lot, I prefer the ones from where I grew up. Thank you for the validation.
Natural casings have lots of variations one to the next, it’s not brand specific.  You’ll get that on all different natural cased sausages from time to time, cooking style/time mad a lot to do with it also
Honestly, Kowalski is garbage compared to koegels. Kowalski has a ton of smoke, too the point it feels forced. 

Do a blind test, they are not even comparable.
Kowalski 'Kowality" Meats!
I won’t say it’s better, but it’s damn good, I go back and forth and am never disappointed
Probably not as much as they used to, but damn they got some good bakeries now
This is correct.  Detroit style deep dish is fantastic.  Grab a Vernor’s to drink too.
Dearborn middle eastern food is also very good
I'm a Cottage Inn fan myself.
If you have a Costco membership, they have Detroit Pizza Co. Detroit style deep dish pizza in the freezer section. It’s not quite as good as Jets, but might be easier for you to obtain. It’s been top pizza on “I tried every frozen pizza from Costco” lists.
PLEASE go to Buddy's if you ever find yourself in Metro Detroit. They're the guys who invented Detroit-style deep dish in the first place. You won't be disappointed.
It's fantastic as fuck, definitely get you some ☺️
1lb of ground beef, 1 small can of tomato sauce, 1 can of chicken stock, 3 minced garlic cloves. Dump that in a pot. Bring to a simmer. Season liberally with smoked paprika, chili powder and cumin. Simmer 3 hours with the lid on. Take the lid off and give it one more hour until most of the liquid is gone. Salt to taste.
Tony Packo's hot dog sauce is the best!
Same! My closest friends live in East Lansing and I insist on taking the drive to Yesterdog every time I visit. We’re both from GR, though, so it’s understood that the pilgrimage is a necessity.
True love, man. Beautiful love story.
The UP is the upper peninsula of Michigan. You should be able to find a way to get their products shipped to you from their website. https://vollwerth.com/#
That's it! 😆 

I kept thinking UFC fighter but couldnt think of who. Now I know why... I think he played a UFC fighter in the new Roadhouse lol.
You could be Travis Willingham's brother or cousin.
Absolutely see it
I've read that before actually about y'alls gas station food lol. And I would love some Louisiana food.
I’m well aware what coney sauce is :)

My question to OP was where they got the sauce for  “the best hotdog in the world”
Agreed!
Ah okay! Thanks for that. I will have to see about ordering some.
Im typing on a cell phone with auto-incorrect. All I’m saying is Flint style coneys are different from others.
And dill pickle slices
Koegels > Kowalski
Yeah.. that is subject to opinion but yeah kowalski’s are great.
Michigander all my life, unused to be a solid Kowalski fan until I had a Vienna… damn it’s a toss up! Both are solid dogs!
These are my absolute favorite!!!
I like a lot of Kowalski products but their dogs ain’t one of em..
As god intended
The snap gave me an existential crisis it’s so good
I’ve always referred to them as snappy dogs.
[deleted]
That’s the one thing I didn’t get!  I’ll get some my next order,  what’s the deal with the pickled bologna?
When I first heard flint or detroit coney sauce, I did on of each,never again. flint coney best ever
Flint style is superior to Detroit style.
My man! 

and Andy’s, don’t forget Andy’s.
Flint uses heart too and it isn't a messy slop.

lol. No disrespect to cabbage. I didn’t even realize that all the things I listed were cabbage based.  Those are just not things I grew up with putting on a dog.
Yeah I don’t mind a chili cheese dog, but (and I know I’m biased as a Michigander) a coney is THE best hot dog.
That is weird. Never knew that.
Up here in Okemos I go to Mertz Meats. They have some of the best brats I've ever had, I think in part because of how soft the casing is.
You forgot: Put phone charger in bathroom. Clear hour from schedule. Enjoy!
My grandma has a recipe that includes beef hearts and lard.
Oh hell yes I’m going to make this
Tomato paste too, but yes this is the quintessential Flint Coney sauce recipe 

Worked at Angelo’s for a bit before it was closed

Steam your buns

Then chop up 1 yellow onion medium dice

And top with coney sauce extra onion and mustard
For a sauce you can buy, yeah it's pretty good.

LOL I'm wearing a Tony Packo's t shirt right now!
I play a shit ton of DnD and make dice as a hobby so I’ll take this all day that’s a handsome man right there
One is Coney Island inc hot dog chili sauce and one is Koegels chili topping.  I’ve been told to try abbots.  I made one mixing manwich in as the base
So very sorry, my reading comprehension is not great first thing in the morning and I have this weird impulse to be helpful. Pretty sure it's a personal preference thing. There's a lot of opinions and I don't think any of them are wrong. 

Apologies if I offended. 

FWIW - I'm not sure there is the best hot dog in the world. I do love my coneys but I also really like Chicago style dogs and those dirty water dogs from New York City are up there too. I think the key is kosher. Natural casing all beef. They snap when you bite them, they crack when you grill them, they taste like summer even in the winter. Koegel's definitely fits this. My wife is partial to their ring baloney and that's usually in our fridge. Before we were married I don't think I even knew it was a thing and now I seek it out.
Dearborn> Kogels > Kowalski
It’s the best.

I’d recommend the regular and getting some picked bologna! I’m not a fan of the pickled but I wish I was lol everyone I know loves it. I’ve heard it’s great with crackers and cheese. My dad would always grab a jar of it and some pinconning cheese on the way up north when I was a kid so we could snack in the tree stand while hunting. I’m sure a lot of fellow Michiganders have memories associated with Koegels 😂
How to eat pickled bologna (imo.)

Remove the skin and slice it into thin-ish rounds. 

Slice Colby (or sharp cheddar if that's your thing) cheese into cracker-sized bites. 

Sandwich the two between Chicken in a Biscuit crackers. 

Thank me later.
Personally, I am not big on it..but my wife and kids and all my wife's family absolutely love it. My wife's family lived out of state for a little bit and realized that not everywhere has pickles bologna.

After that, you just need the Vernors and a body of water and you can live that Michigan life.

Brat sized casings, if they are natural, are usually hog casings and pretty thick.  You can get bigger sheep casing which is thin, tender and great, but $$$ and much harder to work with.  That might be what they use, or a higher grade hog casing
Beef hearts sets a good Coney sauce apart. Hamburger will do in a pinch, but the good stuff is made with the heart.

Also, OP, if you make this, top it with yellow mustard and onions. I was a pretty die hard “all chili dogs need cheese” kind of person in my pre-Coney years, but I was wrong. Just mustard and onions.
Beef heart's good but the problem I find is one heart weighs like 3 lbs so it's really way more than you need unless you're gonna try to freeze it or something. I always bug my hunter friends for deer heart during hunting season. Those are SO good and not as big as a cow heart
My mom had the same recipe but she would grind up a couple of Koegel’s and use them in place of beef hearts. She thought it made for a smoother taste.
Fellow D&D player. Checking out your dice and they are pretty damn handsome too. If I played anywhere in person anymore I would definitely ask to buy some.
I was not impressed with that koegels chili topping. If you can find todoroffs you should pick some up. They carry it a Meijer where I live
If you got it from Abbots then that is probably the original Flint style coney sauce, which is a little bit drier than Detroit style. I like both but I grew up on the Flint style. Detroit style is more wet and runny, almost like a chilli base, I get the Detroit style when I do chilli cheese dogs. Flint style I do just heavy mustard and heavy onion.
Dearborn redhots!
Dearborn are super good. Both skinless and natural casing
This guy coneys
This is the way.
STOP!  I CAN TASTE IT, AND WE DONT HAVE ANY CONEY SAUCE IN THE HOUSE!
This absolutely, pinconning, or sharp cheddar. Also Dad loves his peanut butter on them. Sometimes it got too cold and the peanut butter froze. Good times thanks for bringing up that memory
I hardly ever see anyone mention pinconning cheese! That was our favorite, growing up!
I always have loved their pickled bologna. It is awesome with some good cheese and crackers as you said. I like to get "firecracker jack" which is just colby but with pepperjack stuff in it and throw it on some ritz or chicken and a biscuit crackers and ill eat like a entire jar in one sitting if im in the right mood for pickled bologna.

Its good with lots of different cheeses and crackers though. I know a few people who eat it straight up which isnt my cup of tea but that is a option.
I grew up making pickled bologna samiches. Just made some last week. Ring bologna and whole dill pickles. Run the. Threw a grinder and slap some miracle whip or mayo in it. Mix it up. Great samich spread. Even better with toasted bread and a slice of cheese.
Ope, just gonna sneak right past ya for some more pickled bologna.
Excellent reference!  And I put ketchup on my dogs.
Ever heard of abbots chili sauce?  That’s what the site I got them from has and it is made with beef hearts
Thanks!  I only give them out to friends or horde them like a dice goblin I’ve never sold any it’s just therapeutic for me.  I haven’t posted any of my sets for a while but I just made 2 new gorgeous sets for my coworkers that I’m really proud of I’ll try to post later on
Heading up to Glennie Michigan with my grandpa we’d stop in Pinconning just for the cheese!!! Add pickled bologna to it and it was the best!!!
Mother of Oxford High School shooter found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in landmark ruling
Guilty on all 4 counts.
I hope this is a wakeup call for all parents to pay more attention to their children and warning signs they're depressed or distressed because it can easily get to the point where they'll lash out in deadly ways. Especially in this social climate.
If she was found guilty on all counts, there's no way the Dad is getting off now. She was the more questionable of the two.

Let's just hope the appeals process is short and we never have to hear about these two trashpiles for a long time.
There’s no way to prove this but I believe if they hadn’t run from the cops, they wouldn’t be facing this level of charges in court. Idiots.
As I said, in the Detroit thread, parents cannot simply have kids and check out.

Nothing will ever bring those four students back, so what little justice was finally meted out here will have to do.
Damn, I was hoping they'd find her guilty but kind of surprised the jury actually did it.  Good for them.  She definitely deserves it.  Hopefully the judge doesn't go easy on her with sentencing.

Hopefully James gets a guilty verdict as well.
Finally some accountability with these damn shootings.
Surprised after I saw the make up of the jury.  I thought there would be one or two sympathetic ears.  Her testifying wasn't smart.
Thank goodness. I hope this leads to positive change.
The dad’s gonna get double the time. He taught Ethan how to fucking shoot.
[deleted]
GOOD.

I hope there are fewer and fewer such incidents until one day there are zero. But until that time, those who helped facilitate ALSO need to be held responsible.
![gif](giphy|J8FZIm9VoBU6Q)
Well, well, well, if it isn't the consequences of my own action, inaction, and negligence.
Wow. I thought for sure she was gonna walk and hit the Fox News circuit as the next self righteous Karen.

I don't care about her booty calls, and selfish life style. Plenty on this rock roll like that.  What slayed me is when she was asked (paraphrasing) "If you could go back, would you do anything different?", and that loon said, "No."

That's some fvcking serial killer self confidence that should't see the light of day.
Not much to say but it bears repeating: good.
Tangible consequences for themselves are the only way some parents will stop being completely irresponsible with their kids’ access to firearms, since obviously they don’t care much about their kids’ well-being. Glad to see this verdict.
Good.
You’re damn straight, enjoy prison.
Great news!! I hope this can set future precedent as well.
I hope she rots in prison given what a garbage human being she is. The way she abused her son was next level awful
Maybe if you have mentally or emotionally unstable children at home, buying a gun for them is not good parenting.
Accused Michigan school shooter Ethan Crumbley’s mother wrote an open letter to Donald Trump after the 2016 presidential election praising his support for gun rights.  
  
“As a female and a Realtor, thank you for allowing my right to bear arms. Allowing me to be protected if I show a home to someone with bad intentions,” Jennifer Crumbley wrote in a blog post, according to the Daily Beast.  
  
“Thank you for respecting that Amendment,” added the mother, who worked as a real estate agent in Michigan, according to the outlet, which noted that her staff bio has been taken down.  
  
Ethan, 15, was charged Wednesday as an adult with first-degree murder, terrorism and assault in the shooting rampage that left four students dead and seven others injured when he allegedly opened fire inside Oxford High School, authorities said.  
  
In her open letter of Nov. 11, 2016, that the Daily Beast posted, Jennifer also referred to school trouble, financial struggles, resentments — but also hope for the future.  
  
She said she was skipping car insurance payments to hire a tutor to help her son, who was 10 at the time, and blamed the “common core” curriculum used by teachers.

She continued: “My parents teach at a school where their kids come from illegal immigrant parents. Most of their parents are locked up. They don’t care about learning and threaten to kill my mom for caring about their grades.  
  
“Do you realize Mr. Trump that they get free tutors, free tablets from our Government so they can succeed. Why cant my son get those things, do we as hard working Americans not deserve that too?” Jennifer wrote.

She also wrote that her husband had “suffered a stroke and a broken back and we were with just my income. Do you know how hard it is to support a family on only $40,000 a year? I couldn’t qualify for State Aid. I made to \[sic\] much.  
  
“Mr. Trump, this is why I voted for you. I see the change that we so desperately need. I see jobs coming back, people having to work for their handouts, money going to who really deserve it,” she added. “If this blog even makes it to your eyes … thank you. From the bottom of my heart.”
Great news! 👏 
Good. Now go convict dad. 

Hopefully this conviction puts fear in the hearts of gun-owners with children and makes them think twice. If you must own firearms you'd better keep them under lock and key and away from kids, or their actions are your fault.
This child was abused and ignored by his garbage parents.
Good. The more I learn about this case the worse I feel for Ethan. He did terrible things and his victims didn't deserve what happened to them, but he was just a kid asking for help and instead his parents gave him a gun. If they'd taken things even a little bit seriously and gotten him help instead of arming him, none of this would have happened and four people would still be alive.
GOOD
This is a victory for responsible gun owners. All the guardians/parents better wake up. If you don't know what the kids are capable of living under your roof, you better have a good gun safe or remove the weapons. Hopefully this verdict will have a positive impact on gang violence as well. Good job jury, common sense prevailed. Would love to know what rhetoric came out of the parents mouths at the dinner table the night before.
I'm shocked that anybody is shocked.

how is it there's more stringent rules on drinking liquor than there is on owning a firearm.

had she bought her underage kid alcohol or the keys to a car there wouldn't even be a question as to whether she was at fault.
So sentence wise I saw up to 15 years , is that per count or total. This should be wake up call if your kid is having troubles get them help !! And maybe don’t buy someone a gun whos seeing things and keeping dead bird heads in his room
Good.  Pretty cut and dry to me they put a loaded gun into the hands of a mentally ill underage person and sent him off to school with it.  They are just as culpable as him if not more.
These parents are the absolute scum of the Earth. It made my day that she was found guilty.
Good. I hope she gets the max sentencing. Husband too. 

It astounds me how much these people failed the shooter. I thought the whole trying to flee across the river was awful, but man. So many cries for help and they didn't care enough to parent. Four kids would be still alive if they had.
I hope she’s not counting on Trump to pardon her.
Parents you are responsible for your kids action.
Good. 

Unfortunately, there's a whole lot of parents that need to see there are consequences to both what they've done as well as what they've failed to do. If you give someone access to a weapon while ignoring clear warning signs that they might hurt themselves or others? You deserve to be punished.
Sounded awfully voluntary when she and her husband bought and gave their minor son a handgun. Did she think it was good parenting to hand over a gun to a minor? WOW!
15 years max for each death. Total max of 60 years if sentenced consecutively. Make an example out of them both.
They were trying to flee the country and abandon their murderous child.  They are objectively awful people. And, nothing good can come of anything about this. No one is saved.
I'm a school teacher and I'm so pleased with this verdict! I've been watching the case and trial intently. We see so much mental health issues in school, it's scary to see the dramatic increase over the years.
people keep saying this is a huge deal, dont we see negligent parents tried for stuff like this all the time? I guess it moves the line for what is considered negligent
What is a likely sentence for this?
I’m curious about the GoFundMe that she did to get money to repair a horse gate. Does anyone have any info about this? Can’t remember where I read or saw this. Her dad was mentioned setting it up for her or was involved in it somehow. Do people really do this for gate repair? Seems a bit scammy!
I heard a woman call into a YT streaming show, claiming to be a mother of someone who attended the HS. Said that there was a history of CPS calls made bc the kid was at the house alone all the time. Also that on more than one occasion, other parents had to step in and wait w EC when the parents were late about picking him up etc. If that is true, I wish it had been discussed sooner in court. I don’t care about affairs or horses. If anything, parental rights to having hobbies & extra marital affairs are under attack, not the second amendment 
Now do dad.
How long was she sentenced for? I can't find it in the article.
Good.
Rittenhouse next
I'm in Michigan.  Good..
This is making me have depression and now due to depression I want to do this well I won't but depression makes me want too
This will set a precedent going forward. It should also be if you buy your kids alcohol or allow kids to drink at your house and they go kill someone in a car you should be responsible and put in jail too.   Are we going to go after all the other shitty parents whose kids have gotten a hold of unlocked guns and they go to jail too?  At what point are you not responsible for the actions of your kids.
Cool, now do the school admins who are guilty of the same level of negligence.
Good riddance
This kids clearly needed therapy not firearms, im ok with this ruling but it could be harder in a situation where a person just snaps and goes on the nut and starts shooting people.

Also, a 17 year old shooter, we can charge the parents but an 18 year old shooter, we can't?  Seems sketchy.

All in all, not sad about this.  Hope it holds up in appeal.
It’s not a landmark ruling. It’s just a jury verdict.
Good, now they can start prosecuting the shitty parents of kids who shoot people in a robbery or get caught up in dumb gang shit when they’re barely even teens.
Every parent that has a kid that does this should be held accountable somewhat. Even having to pay a fine for the rest of their lives to the school their kid has done such an atrocity only makes sense.
I knew she would be. There's no way they'd let her off since it's such a huge national story.
Somehow I doubt this is surviving appeals
If this logic applies to the parents, it needs to apply to the school as well imo.
Slippery slope aside it was the right call.

I have a bigger issue with completely absolving the school from any blame though.
it will be interesting

 Mothers are always held to a higher standard.
How was she supposed to know that it was in his backpack and plus it was locked in the safe how did she know that he knew a combination?
[deleted]
Are we all celebrating new precedence like republicans didn’t just roll back decades of settled law?
[deleted]
  After ten grueling hours of deliberation, the air in the courtroom thickened with tension, the very walls seemed to hold their breath. It wasn't the swift, decisive victory the prosecution might have hoped for; there were whispers of holdouts, dissent simmering beneath the surface. One couldn't help but wonder if the jury, composed perhaps of weary parents grappling with their own teenagers' inscrutable logic, found resonance in the tangled threads of the case.  
And what of the jury selection process? Was it a roulette of chance or a calculated dance of legal strategy? The mystery lingers, shrouded in the enigmatic cloak of courtroom procedure.  
Meanwhile, amidst the storm of argument, the defense team stood steadfast, a lone warrior against the tempest, with only one attorney to navigate the treacherous waters of justice. A David and Goliath tale unfolding in the hallowed halls of the law.
And the only gun owners worried about this are the ones who give their 5 year olds guns.
The murder of 4 students and wounding of the 7 others and the resulting trauma of the hundreds of others will nvr be minimized by finding Momma C guilty.Its not even a start. All those posting it’s a wake up call to parents to start paying attention .. pfft! Yall are probably the ones who believe they have rights to send their kid to school and demand the school accommodate their child’s special needs or ask before you go on vacation if the resort you stay at has a large gluten free selection even tho you don’t have celiac disease, you just think it’s better way of eating. You’ve been accommodated so much you’re the ones who’ve made people like the Crumbley’s fearful of having a child different. Yall come across demanding and self righteous vs accommodating and accepting. Don’t misread my statement. Buying a gun and telling him it was his was fkn stupid and wrong. Having a child with issues is scary and most parents don’t want that. You, the demanding, self righteous bunch who think you should be accommodated vs being kind and taking care of your own issues are the ones that when ppl do have serious issues are afraid of. Tone it down a bit. Realize we all live in this world. Special needs do not need to be thrust in everyday life. They should be treated differently yet with kindness. You don’t want a kid with strep throat in class so why should a kid with a behavioral health issue be in class. I agree, keep your kid at home when they are ill and get them help. The factor you’re missing is who decides when the child is “acting out” or is truly “ill”? Remember my gluten free diet example… only true celiacs require that and it is not common most CHOSE to go gluten free. Parents always put their foot down re: medical care. Some refuse immunizations, which puts my medically fragile child at risk. It ain’t right. Will that decision lead to prosecution should my child contract an illness from your decision? Think about it!! Your child can’t control outbursts in class, decides to throw a book and hits my kid, who now requires stitches. You sent the kid to school. Bingo! You betcha I’m calling the DA. Kids with impulse control are going to be the ones targeted here cuz schools/teachers aren’t meant to control kids-you parents are. Good Luck 🍀
Hope she gets reduced sentence on appeal
Since mom is guilty , so is dad.. And the principal of the school
What a dogshit article
Unpopular Opinion: almost all the school shooter kids have loser face. We need to do something about that.
If they owned a car dealership and weren’t dirtbags, she’d walk!
Step 1: Get all inmates out of the jail she's going to.  
Step 2: Bury her and her husband under the jail  
Step 3: Set the jail on fire and let it burn to ash  
Step 4: Have folks come by and piss on the ashes
This has to be one of the worst articles ever written. I should've seen the website with the title "click" and realized it was just clickbait.

Article literally offers no details how a verdict was reached.

if you are not familiar with the case these article actually explains the background of the case: [https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-07/legal-precedent-michigan-school-shooter-mother-jennifer-crumbley/103435710](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-07/legal-precedent-michigan-school-shooter-mother-jennifer-crumbley/103435710)

Also, it seems like there is plenty of blame to be assigned to the school. The kid literally told them he was about to shoot up the school, but the teachers and principle let him stay in class. Their excuse was they didn't know he actually had access to a gun. I cant imagine that defense will hold up in a civil trial.
Then, the parent of every criminal needs to be charged with the crime their kid committed.
Once again, America thinks justice is directing your anger at an easy target. Glad everyone is happy here that we're ruining more lives. Absolute insanity that we think it's ok to jail someone for the actions of another. North Korea and China go after the family members of criminals, but I thought we were better. 

Also, and I apologize if this is disrespectful, but I'm guessing most people here haven't lived with a psychopath before because if you think this ruling is going to help prevent mass shootings your wrong. Getting your parents in trouble for your own actions is just the icing on the cake for these sick fucks. This ruling is exactly what Ethan wanted to achieve.
I think that the prosecutor will argue that the tapes and or witnesses were a foreseeable consequence of their actions or inactions. Anyone can argue it’s prejudicial but I wouldn’t hold my breath.
[removed]
Does anyone remember if there was a similar landmark ruling on parents of bullies or something? It was a while ago
Used to live about 10 minutes away from oxford when this happened. There was 45 minutes straight of sirens going off and I had no clue what was happening at the time.  One day I'll never forget
Good. Now throw the book at her.
Good. If you decide to have kids you need to make sure they grow up to be a productive part of society.
I saw a report saying she's facing 15 years, but I thought it was 15 years for each count of involuntary manslaughter, so 60 years? Which is it
I called it when it all went down, my friends said I was crazy.
Genuine question…will other parents of any school schoolers before be prosecuted now that its case law??
Yes yes yes
I think from a legal perspective it’s hard to understand how she is guilty of manslaughter. Like, they brought the journals in but she didn’t know about them, or they didn’t prove she did.
She’s an awful parent, but I just don’t think it rises to the level of manslaughter.
I feel like this kid was screaming and having a ticker tape parade with red flags and his parents just looked the other way.
If he hid everything and stole that gun from somewhere. I'd have a lot my sympathy for the parents. He was literally screaming for help and they bought him a gun. Wtf is wrong with these people?
You'll be surprised how many parents encourage their kids to be bullies. My neighbors son used to hit my son on the way home and they just said stay away from him then. One time he shoved my son so hard he got a nose bleed. Parents still didn't do anything. I had to pick up my son from the bus stop from that day on. Some parents are just bullies themselves.
Easy thing would be is to keep your guns secure at all times.
I think it's because Michigan law makes parent accountable, and this case proved the charge can stick.  If all other states had similar laws, sensible parents would start locking up their guns and theoretically there'd be fewer school shooting

So my kid gives me creepy vibes.... what should I do?
On the flip side, I’ve recently seen interviews with two parents who are clearly not at fault and did everything you’d expect any reasonable parent could possibly do to raise a good kid and encourage gun safety who have spent the last two years *awaiting trial* with a $500,000 bond.

That’s not justice and doesn’t fix the root of the problem. It punishes two victims and the real reason those two victims are being punished is so that corrupt gun lobbies can continue making bank while the courts act like they’re doing something.

From what I’ve seen of this case, this lady in particular probably deserves some punishment. But I fail to see how she is anything less than a scapegoat being used to distract from the real issues.
Wake up call, lol read the evidence presented. She has no heart.
That's exactly my thought too. Her husband had a much larger role in Ethan even having the gun in the first place. She just didn't react to the signs he was going to do it.  He's toast.  


Today is a good day for the families of the victims and Michigan's justice system as a whole. There is now good precident for future cases so long as the appeals process proceeds in the state's favor.
Good 👍🏼
Do you think he’ll go to trial? If I am Mr. Crumbley’s attorney, I am looking for plea bargain, where Mr. Crumbley blames Jennifer.
You can't say there's no way because you never know with a different defense attorney and a new jury.
I liked when she tried throwing him under the bus for not having the gun properly secured. I’m sorry but purchasing a gun for your minor child should definitely be a “two yes” situation. If the both of you are not comfortable handling the gun- don’t do it. One adult being comfortable in that situation is not enough.
I’m not so sure.  I read one of the jurors say that a key part of their decision to convict was that Jennifer was the last one known to have the gun based on surveillance video.  It made very little sense to me, but at least one did say that.  Presumably it would have been more difficult for that juror to convict the dad, but I hope you’re right.
Yes I think that is what pushed the authorities to see this as not only lousy parenting but criminally lousy parenting. Frankly I am glad that parents of this calibre are finally held accountable for abdicating their parental responsibilities.
Her expressing that she had no regrets about anything whilst on the witness stand didn't do her any favors, either. I understand that criminal trials are not popularity contests, but my god, she has zero redeeming qualities that would make anyone sympathetic towards her.
Talk about putting a target on their backs with that move.  That just pissed everyone off, and got their names and faces out there.

And did they really think Canada would just let them stay?
Nah, they also encouraged some of his horrible behavior and laughed off warning signs while making sure he had access to a weapon. The other facts in this pertaining to the parents actions and inactions are incredibly damning. They ran because they realized they were responsible for this occurring.
I believe they weaponized a son who was known to have severe mental health issues which they neglected to get treatment. Many 15 year olds have guns purchased by their parents. This child was known to be ill. He was neglected. He’s is a child. Every parent has a responsibility to get help for their children. And every adult has responsibility to get help for themselves. It’s rampant in our society and has gotten worse since the pandemic. Most of the mass shooters have signs of emotional or mental instability. It’s a huge problem and there many societal factors that contribute to worsening of mental health.
I love that they ran to the most populous city in the state to hide.
By running, they demonstrated their guilty consciences. They *knew* that they had been grossly negligent and allowed this to happen.
Running to Detroit and hiding didn’t help them, but they’re not the brightest of douchebags.
Will start looking around in Costco parking lots from now on. Disgusting woman! Couldn’t even look a bit more presentable in court.
Big RED FLAG that kid hurting animals. Birds are probably not his only kill and torture.
Anyone know what happened to their pets. A cat, kitten and possibly a dog. 
Do hope they got adopted to a cleaner home.
They probably would have been out on bail.
If there's anything I learned from watching COPS as a kid is never run from the cops, you won't get away and it just makes things worse
they didnt just check out, the school told them their kid was mental and their response was to buy him a gun.
>parents cannot simply have kids and check out.

You're not wrong.

But you'll never, ever be able to eradicate shitty parents.
Could you imagine if she’s found guilty but James isn’t?  I’m not sure how one could be less guilty than the other. Just such shitty fucking parents and this was almost certainly preventable if they weren’t.
School deserves to be punished as well.
Yes
What about Junior?
She is so unlikable. Basically, her story was "I can't help my mentally unstable kid found our unsecured gun and went human hunting. This parenting shit is hard and stuff, and I gotta live my life, too."

I'd be crying, wearing a hair shirt and begging for forgiveness. She looked pissed off that she actually had to deal with any of this.  

Her lawyer should have never put her on the stand. She has all the empathy of a rock.
You only testify if you think you have already lost and hope to push back. She probably didn’t like what she heard and I will bet her lawyer was against it.
As far as I’m concerned, his dad is a murderer too. He knew what he was teaching and who he was teaching and how he was as a human being
Didn’t she go to shooting range with EC?
She didn’t have a choice in Michigan either side is entitled to a jury trial. The prosecutor would have demanded one.
[deleted]
And she said she wished her son would have killed his parents instead.

Imagine THAT being your only sorrow. "The monster I formed, who was crying for help daily, should have taken it upon himself to kill his own parents."

I'm glad the kid is in prison forever, but I'm *really* glad his worthless, selfish parents will be in there, too, just not for long enough.
She *had* to say that.  If she said "Yes, I should have taken him home" she would basically be admitting culpability.  

The defense did a terrible job preparing her for her testimony.
I’m no lawyer but I thought that question might trick her into implicating herself. If she said yes I’d change things then bam she admits she was acting negligently. Know what I mean?
We should care about her booty calls and selfish life though, that's all time spent away from and ignoring her son. Who she knew was going through it at the time. I'm not saying parents don't deserve a life of their own and to do their own things but the circumstances here called for her to give her son some extra attention for a while and especially should have got him some therapy or counseling to help deal with the losses in his life. Whether or not they had anything to do with his decision to go through with his plan, they certainly didn't help. Also agree it was hard to hear no, she wouldn't change a thing but I get why she had to say that and I don't believe she was lying. She's stone cold and selfish.
Yes
AKA "there were signs long before they bought Ethan a fucking gun"
Ah.... and there you have the mindset of most Trump supporters.

What about ME!  Why do THEY get free stuff.

Normal people don't give a shit what others have.  Stop coveting the poor.  Stop pretending YOU are the real victims.  I need a bridge card but make too much money!  Whaaa.  I have horsies but I'm so working poor my kid needs a free tablet just like THEY get.  Who is this THEY again?  Crazy Trump nut.  Good riddance.  A couple million more out there still.
She is finally getting all of the FREE stuff that she was complaining about.  Hopefully, she will get at least 15 years of FREE room and board, all at the expense of the tax payer.
Why are they always realtors?
Well of course she is Trump trash.
She’s a horrible human being and it’s a tragedy that she and her equally horrible husband were ever allowed to have a child.
What the hell word salad did I just read?
so she took her kid out of school, and then asked why her son didnt get to have all the things the school provided?
Yes
At least my thought on the case it wasn’t just the unlocked gun , it was just the lack of care of her sons situation, he went to her wanting mental health treatment but it was brushed so she could attended her weekly screw session at Costco and ride horses that’s why she’s spending a good majority of the rest of her life in prison
I wonder if dad will plead guilty to cut a deal.
Out of all the checked out parents and their school shooter kids, this one gets me. 

If his narcissistic trash parents had bothered to dump him off at Havenwick or any local ER, 4 kids might have graduated. And just maybe he might have turned his life around.
Same.  What got me was that the assistant principal [was quoted](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/01/opinion/mother-homicide-court-crumbley.html?unlocked_article_code=1.SE0.VPJU.gU1_yesL_Gn6&bgrp=c&smid=url-share):

>“It was when I realized it was Ethan that I didn’t think he could possibly be the shooter.” She went on: “It seemed so odd that it would be him, so I said, ‘Buddy, are you OK? What’s going on?’ When he didn’t respond to me and he looked away, that’s when I knew it was him. That he was the shooter.”

Like, this was a genuine surprise to the staff that he could do this.  If he had either gotten help or never had access to a gun, none of this would have ever happened.  I'm really glad to hear this verdict.
We're only shocked because we've been calling for this for years and it's finally happened. Hopefully more parents get charged in the future.
Per count
This isn’t a federal crime. They can’t be pardoned by a President. This would be the governor of Michigan, and in our blue violet state even a Republican governor isn’t touching their case.
she and Daddy are huge MAGAs, I fully see them begging him for support.

Trump won't care because duh, but. It'll happen.
Not always. Some kids rebel. They do things without their parents knowledge or consent. They break rules and despite parents trying to help them do better the kid still screws up. 

In this case, the parents bought guns and let their demon child have access to them despite the kid literally screaming that he was going to kill people. 

Personally, I’d draw the line at parents who do anything grossly irresponsible or enabling being held accountable. That’s any parent that leaves around unsecured firearms, any parent who buys their kid booze and gives them car keys, etc.
You have no understanding of the issue. They are not making her (and probably the father when that trial finalizes) responsible for her own actions. She bought her child a weapon, did not secure the weapon, and ignored her child's mental health symptoms. They aren't being charged for what the kid did, but for being the person that let it happen.

Parents are only responsible to a certain point. Beyond that, its never going to be on the parent. Kids (as in anyone under 18) are sentient beings who can make fucked up choices.
This is the first time a school shooter's parents have been convicted on manslaughter charges. Before this, the closest was a father who was convicted for illegally purchasing the gun, but nothing to do with the shooting itself.

The big deal is that some will vote this as confirmation that people other than just the shooter will be held responsible for creating these tragedies.
Sentencing is in April I believe
Her sentencing isn't until april
Sentencing isn't for a while yet.
Doesn’t seem to be in this article, a separate [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/06/us/jennifer-crumbley-oxford-shooting-trial/index.html) article stated: 

“She faces up to 15 years in prison, and her sentencing hearing was set for April 9. She has been behind bars since her arrest in a Detroit warehouse days after the shooting.”
Sentencing is a different hearing once the verdict is determined. She will have a sentencing court date set and that’s when we will know how long. 

This hearing was to determine responsibility only.
I’m not sure of your point. Allowing kids to drink at your house, then knowingly letting them drive home, has long been enforced in court.
“Same level”? Got a source for them buying a gun for a clearly troubled student? I agree that they were negligent too, but they didn’t literally provide the murder weapon like his parents did.
There has to be a cutoff somewhere. We as a society have deemed that we are adults at 18.
He was 15 when the crime was committed.
Actually it is landmark because parents of mass shooter have never been charged and convicted like this before.
Especially if they buy their kids a gun!
It entirely depends on how the kid obtains the gun and if parents were negligent of their kids health. This prosecution was because they bought the kid a gun, didn't secure the gun, and ignored mental health warning signs of their kid.
Well charge the school when they start buying kids guns
The prosecution had to walk a tight rope to keep the shade of the school during this trail. The school fucked up, but it was the presence of the gun.  If that was made aware to the school, this would have never happened.
It should apply to the teachers involved by proximity and the students families that set these people off as well. These psychos are a product of their environment at home and at school
The shooter himself testified that the gun was *not* locked up the day of the shooting. That’s how he was able to bring it to school. Also if a *reasonable* parent saw that their child drew a violent picture involving a gun shortly after buying said child a gun, they’d have to be incredibly irresponsible to not either mention the existence of that gun or take the child home to check for themselves.
This is, as far as I'm aware, the first time a manslaughter charge has been issued to a parent of a school shooter. This is not the first time a parent has been convicted for charges related to a school shooting. It's not setting much of a precedent because it fits pretty much all the hallmarks of a standard involuntary manslaughter conviction: the accused did not intend to cause anyone to die, the accused took actions that they should have known would have created a significant risk of harm, and people died as a result.
It does set a precedence but this is such an extreme situation . I could see other da’s using it in mass shooting situations if the factors match up
![gif](giphy|KGSxFwJJHQPsKzzFba)
I think it has to do with gross negligence. When you fail in your job so poorly that someone dies, you can be charged. Where the lack of even the slightest care or diligence could have saved lives, and you failed that low bar.

I think these parents qualify. I also don't think this case is as historic case law as people are suggesting. I doubt many shooters parents would qualify.
Well for starters, maybe just don’t buy your child a gun. Then if you have your own guns, make sure they are properly secured inside a gun safe that your child cannot get into. Next, if your child is displaying symptoms of depression, get them into therapy for that. Finally, if your child tells you they’re having violent hallucinations, take them to a psychiatric professional instead of mocking them. 

It’s remarkably easy to not fuck up the way these shitty parents did, you just have to actually care.
[deleted]
Yep, someone should have searched his heavy backpack. (Parents knew about unlocked gun) Then called cops to take him to a mental facility. Obviously these parents were useless, so school should have stepped in on getting him help.
Hot take. What don’t you like about it?
You may not know this but only administrators can send students home. The teachers did everything within their power.
I’m a little surprised they didn’t search his bag that instant. Wonder if they have a school lawyer on tap who would’ve told them a search was constitutional or not. Then again I thought we had no expectation of privacy in school grounds.
Not every parent gave their kid the tools to commit the crime, laughed off their kid almost getting caught planning to commit the crime, ignored the well being of the child committing the crime to the point that they allowed the crime to happen. 

Get real.
Sure if you completely ignore the context of the ruling. She basically gave him the go ahead. She knew he needed help and instead of helping or even acknowledging his issues, she gave him a gun and said go play.
She wasn’t prosecuted for being his family member, she was prosecuted for buying and giving him a gun. Frankly, they both deserve to be brought up on federal gun charges too.
Her actions and lack of action left an unlocked gun, at the hand of her mentally unstable son , who then shot up a school, North Korea and china its for actions of the state. Ms crumbly is going to prison for not giving a shit for her kid, and then acting shocked when he killed four people two very different situations
Oh don't apologize for being disrespectful.  We all know you don't mean it

And since you apparently missed the point of everything, they aren't being punished because their kid shot up a school.  They are being punished because they did everything in their power to encourage and assist their son in shooting up a school

We are blaming them for their actions and negligence.  You can pretend this is just a case of retribution.  And while some of that is here, that was not the *only* thing behind this case.  Great gaslighting though
Removed. See rule #1 in the [r/Michigan subreddit rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Michigan/wiki/index#wiki_rules).
Often charges like this are served concurrently. According to [this](https://www.cbsnews.com/detroit/news/break-down-of-jennifer-crumbley-conviction-oxford/) article it's expected that hers will also be. So 15 years maximum.
And how she just shrugged it off like she thought he was joking. WTF? She said he didn't show any signs of mental illness. Lady, he said he could hear demons in his head. That was the sign!
I'm surprised they left the dead bird/bird head out of her case - HUGE flag
He definitely was trying to get attention in the only way his ill mind knew how. And it worked. Attention on his parental neglect and abuse. So many people and systems failed this boy. He’s an example of neglect of mental health care for a child. Same systems that failed him also failed the children who were killed. It’s putin place to protect not just one child but all our children.
Hi I’m from the area. I’ve only heard things (rumors) from word of mouth, nor will I repeat them here, but the common theme of them was that his parents were always very self centered and neglectful, to the point where it seemed like something was bound to happen to this kid. It’s very sad that this was the outcome.
It wasn't just the parents, the faculty ignored the signs too
Nah. It seems like she bought him a gun with the hope he would kill himself.
Absolutely! And the parents failed at that by 1) not changing the codes from the 000 default, 2) apparently not using the cable locks, and 3) keeping the keys to the locks "hidden" in a beer stein (if they did actually use them)
Recent law already requires guns be kept locked at all times when not in use.
They gave him the gun as a gift…
Some secure them as best as they can.  Literally in a safe with a combo lock or key.  Some kids still get into them.  This is gonna spiral downwards from here on out.  Eventually, parents will be blamed for most crimes their kids commit, be it severe or minor.
I own more firearms than most, and I'm not on her side.  Mine are all secured if they are not in my immediate possession.  My kids do not have access to my firearms, although I have taught them how to shoot some guns.  They also aren't displaying sociopathic tendencies or a desire to harm others.
100%. Their paranoia surrounding all this is alarming to me.
I've not actually seen anyone on her side but then I don't hang out in the crazy gun crowd.
Wrong. I own guns and have no sympathy. Don't lump everyone in a damn political bucket.
I have yet to see a single Reddit gun sub, rally in support of her.
Luckily enough there were 12 people not on her side after hearing all the evidence. She will appeal however many times she can but I don’t think it’s going to do her much good. One down one to go.
If you are serious and not trolling then have them see a therapist.
Talk to them and find out what's going on.  Keep all weapons in the house secure and locked away from anyone who is not responsible enough to be around them.  What is it that gives you the creeps I guess should also be asked
They could have terminated their parental rights, and have the state deal with the kid.

The foster care system is nightmare fuel. Most likely their kid would have went into a residential behavioral treatment place. But that is better than killing 4 people and rotting in jail until you die.
>But I fail to see how she is anything less than a scapegoat being used to distract from the real issues.

On one hand, I think it was a great move that she got convicted based on everything presented.

On the other, I think you're 100% correct.  As a society, it seems like we've given up on the idea that this is a problem that can ever be fixed, so rather than address the real cause we just look for new places to lay the blame.

And we all know that this will not at all be preventative - we've already decided as a country that gun ownership is the thing to protect.  This will happen again and again, but hey, now we can add parents to the list of who to blame.
> Today is a good day for the families of the victims and Michigan's justice system as a whole.

Today is a good day for justice in the entire country. If this sort of thing starts to become commonplace, we will actually begin to make *some* progress in school shootings for the first time in the history of school shootings.
Like I said in another comment, their best bet would be arguing the the admission of the two witnesses to the shooting's testimony and the video of the shooting were prejudicial and only served to paint a picture of the result of their actions, and not the actions themselves that led to the result, if that makes sense.

They'll argue it elicited an emotional response that *someone* needs to be punished for this, and Jennifer Crumbley was a convenient target.

I don't think they'll prevail in getting a re-trial or a mistrial, but I think McDonald opened the door when she argued to made that admissible.
Guns don't kill people without bullets. Dad supplied the gun but mom supplied the ammo. They're both equally guilty and they're probably going to face federal charges for the illegal transactions they made to supply their child with a murder weapon and ammunition.
"Future cases" hell yeah cheers to that mate! Muh guns hmrhmrbbb
Okay I hope your children don't do anything without your permission. This is a dangerous precedent that we aren't going to see the repercussions of till 20 years down the road. People please be smarter I know I'm asking alot of Reddit but please use a little more brain power.
The prosecutor has always said there is no plea bargaining on the table
That's not how that works. She was already convicted. He has nothing to trade.
The kid already testified that the money used to buy the gun was his and that he gave it to his father to make the purchase. Dad should be in federal court for the illegal transaction after he faces state charges for manslaughter. Same for the mom. She bought bullets at the gun range, and he used what was left over after their target practice to commit mass murder.
A different and less insufferable whiny defense attorney might help, but unless Jennifer is willing to undergo a major make-over of both her decidedly unsympathetic personality and appearance, I'm not sure that a different jury would let her off scot-free.
She was being a patriotic 'murican. Admitting something she did is wrong might mean her ideology is wrong as well.
> And did they really think Canada would just let them stay?

Or even let them IN?

Did they even have passports or enhanced licenses? 

They were wanted by the police, they'd have been apprehended at the border & turned over to US authorities.
deserve fearless fretful makeshift alleged pathetic chop one panicky versed

They def felt the walls closing in. My guess is they wanted to have a last hurrah and get drunk and were worried they wouldn’t be granted bail. Their actions in running guaranteed they wouldn’t.
And as both seemed to be MAGA Trump types, a very blue city as well. Plus trying to flee to a comparatively 'Socialist! \[Commies, OMG!\]' country like Canada which these two dolts don't seem to have realized has extradition treaties with the US. The Crumbleys are stupider than a box of rocks.

Grossly neglectful parents. They should’ve have their son taken away from them when they didn’t get him help. Unfit parents. As a rent you do whatever it takes to get mental health treatment for your child. They are dependent upon you. He knew something was wrong with him. And no one helped him. It’s tragic. All
If it. Makes me angry and sickened with sadness. Our friend’s-best friend son was killed in this shooting. I feel for her and her family. And I also feel for Ethan as well. He was a sick child and left to his own devices to cope because his parents didn’t care.
Oh I fully agree; it’s as if they were actively trying to be as crappy as possible.

Purchasing a gun for a minor (?) and then being extremely cavalier in how it’s stored/taught to be used is the height of irresponsibility.
And refused to have him taken out of the school when the staff expressed concerns about the drawings.
.....and yet you'll see lots of comments about how the school was at fault.  No mention of the parents.  The amount of narcissism and deflection in people is exhausting.  Poor parenting is the root issue in schools right now.  Administration and teachers are powerless because.....apparently.....parents hold all the cards.  Until they fuck up, that is.  Then it's the school's fault.  Shocker.
A similar thing occurred with Nancy Lanza who thought that somehow buying a gun was some kind of cure-all for the really drastic issues of her son Adam. Of course, he then 'thanked Mom' by blowing her away before perpetrating his massacre at the Sandy Hook Elementary School. While I can still weep for his innocent victims, both Adam and Nancy can rot in their graves. No pity for them. And none for the Crumbleys -- it's surprising that Ethan, instead of taking it out on the innocent people at the school, didn't turn that gun on Mom and Dad instead.
Of course not. But when parents ARE actually as shitty as these two, by having purchased a gun for their obviously troubled son, and being negligent with its storage/usage, they need to be held accountable.
She wasn't the one who bought the gun, so I'm assuming that if she's been found guilty, he might as well just plea out at this point.
>Could you imagine if she’s found guilty but James isn’t?  I’m not sure how one could be less guilty than the other.

Of the two I thought the case against James was actually stronger since he's the one who bought Ethan the gun.  I'd be really shocked to see him acquitted after she was found guilty.

Although I think when this goes to appeal he'll have a stronger case.
The father is more guilty. He’s the one who bought the gun and didn’t properly secure it
I do worry that people tend to hold mothers more responsible than fathers for the wellbeing of their children. I guess time will tell.
I think they'll be held accountable in the civil case.  I doubt any administrators will go to prison over this.
I hope one of the outcomes is that the school has to  establish procedures for mental health issues, especially urgent (suspected suicidal ideation) and emergent. They focused too much on 'behavioral issues needing discipline'. 

The school kept alerting the school counselor to possible mental health issues- yet the counselor was more focused on 'counseling for college/career'. They should have to maintain training (continuing ed)  on mental health issues- recognition, when to escalate- procedures for emergent issues.

Why didn't the counselor advise about and request that the parents call Common Ground central intake or crisis line right from the office? The counselor wasn't going to do a depression screen or suicide risk screen despite their suspicions. Leaving the parents to try to call random numbers without guidance was a drop.

However- the parents had the ultimate responsibility to seek help. They had the responsibility to supervise usage and otherwise keep the gun from Ethan. 

Common Ground:  
[https://commongroundhelps.org/](https://commongroundhelps.org/)
I agree, but I doubt there will be any consequences for the school beyond what's already happened (school board and administration being let go).
I believe the court already ruled that the school cannot be held liable, but I don't know if that was in a criminal case or a civil case.
Yesssssssss no one talking about it
They have governmental immunity unfortunately, so they can't be held accountable criminally.
He plead out, and got a life sentence?  They're appealing the Miller ruling, but he's got getting out of jail at minimum for a very long time.
He was convicted.
What is a hair shirt?
It's the client's decision whether or not to testify, not the lawyer's.
And also, while it sounds shallow, her appearance had deteriorated during the time in jail and she wasn't very attractive or telegenic which I suppose could affect a juror's opinion at some unconscious level. She looked slovenly and about 20 years older than her chronological age. Her inept defense attorney didn't even try to clean up her appearance for the courtroom.
Eh, parents are often pretty biased about their kids.  Also, Dad was probably brought up that way as well.  How far down the generational cycle of parenting do we need to look to find a culprit?
Was speaking from more of a... logic/reason and moral standpoint rather than legal specifically.
So is an affirmative of the conviction.
And it’s a messy ass house too. No disturbed 15 year old needs a gun. He was already torturing animals without it.
Butttt, butttt,  he needed that gun to protect himself from all of the bad illegal immigrants.
And she was a realtor?! Who in their right mind would entrust the biggest financial deal of their life, whether selling or buying a home, to this trashy idiotic woman?
BAMN, you nailed it!!
Another MAGA nut hits the dust
2nd horsey cost $5 grand, an alcohol related purchase. They’re Boston worthless humans and deserve prison. So thrilled she was found guilty.
She’ll get free medical and dental in jail
Because real estate/sales is kind of a failure job. You don’t have the skills or education for anything else, but are an extrovert? Sales.
Ignoring everything else (the racism and xenophobia and gun nuttery), how on earth is she complaining about not getting aid and then complaining that too much aid is the problem?
Hahaha, you nailed it!!
I agree that mental health is the bigger reason Ethan did what he did. But, we can't prosecute parents for failing to get their kids mental health treatment simply because you'd be locking up way too many parents for failing to do something that is difficult to do in our society. Mental health clinics are not on every street corner and not everyone has the financial means to even access them if they were. Parents can't easily access mental health reaources for themselves when needed... especially families that come from similar means as the Crumbleys.

Where this parent went horibbly and irresponsibly wrong was giving her son access to a firearm and training on how to use it. Introducing the gun into her families situation is what makes her culpable. If she had just neglected Ethans mental health she'd be like millions of other parents... but she added a gun to the mix which is the definition of gross negligence.
They're not valuable to Trump because they're not rich or influential, so he won't help them, but damn sure he'll use them/their story to further his own agenda.
Doesn’t matter when your dog bites someone do you say not my fault the dog was rebelling, your kid your problem. If you can’t handle that responsibility don’t have kids.
I guess we will see they both couldn’t have bought the gun so I guess under your logic the dad will get off.
I think the sentence is to be handed down Friday at 9am unless I heard wrong.
Not with jail time and involuntary manslaughter.  It’s usually a fine in Michigan.   Now maybe they will serve time in jail
It's not the first; there are several instances of parents being tried for various crimes relating to their kids going on mass shootings. IIRC the father of the Highland Park shooting plead. 

It's also not a "ruling" as this isn't an opinion of the court; it's literally a jury verdict. If there is an appeal, and the court upholds the trial court, then sure, you could call it a ruling. Rulings deal with matters of law, an verdicts deal with matters of fact in criminal cases.
Why bother with all those details? Just put the parents in jail and call it a day.
If you actually listened to the trial, you would know there is a lot more to why the mom was found guilty besides "bought kid a gun".
You kidding me?  I'm a teacher.  I've got some strange kids.....but they're not MY KIDS.  I teach them.  If I see something, I report something.  To
lump "teachers in proximity" in with wacko, Trumper adoring parents is one of the most asinine things I've ever read.  No wonder society is shattering.  Let's always look for someone else to blame.  Schools have no power.  The "parent's rights" bullshit has made districts literally cower to parents.  Ethan's parents insisted he go back to class.  Since poor parenting is the number one issue in education right now, and they hold all the cards....we're screwed.
This is called a “landmark decision” as if it means anything for handling law in the future. Well the Roe decision only stood for nearly 50 years. 
which woman?
>Why are you making it sound like there are any noble or admirable qualities to that woman?

 Noble? Admirable? Are we speaking of the same person, or have you stumbled into the wrong den of vipers, my friend?
It feels like it was written by chatGPT. It spends a large amount of time discussing the elements of a criminal charge and not applying any facts to analyze why she was found guilty, you know, the interesting part. I’m a lawyer and it was frustrating. I learned nothing from the article beyond the headline.

For example they talk about the negligence element but provided no indication as to what the jury may have found negligent.
They could have avoided all liability if the school would've bothered to notify Police the instant they became aware a school shooting threat had been made. A threat can be verbal or non-verbal, to include written word.

The police wouldve had full authority to search the person making the threat.
> she was prosecuted for buying and giving him a gun

Then charge her with that
>Ms crumbly is going to prison for not giving a shit for her kid

Then charge her with that
Not gonna read a comment that just insults me, but glad I helped you feel good about yourself.
Speaker of House Johnson is hearing voices also.   Must be catching.

Jesus, hadn't heard that part.
Right, to normal people animal torture is a red flag. To country folk, that's just practice for hunting. They don't see torture as a bad thing, because there is no empathy towards anything outside of "their tribe"

I don't know how many times I saw kids shooting birds with pellet guns or killing raccoons with .22s and hanging up their skins. Same with deer or cats. It is just so normalized in their circles...
nobody i know uses those cable locks that come with the guns. they'll keep a toddler from hurting themselves, but they're not secure enough to keep out an unsupervised teenager with too much time on their hands. if that's all you got to secure your weapons, i guess it's better than nothing, but it's not much.
[deleted]
No. They are required to be locked up *only* in the presence of children.
If your guns are all secured and your kids don’t have access to them you aren’t a “gun nut” then, just a responsible gun owner
[deleted]
As someone who literally goes by Michigan Gun Guys on social media, nobody is or should be on her side. She fucked up, the faculty fucked up, and Ethan is a POS.
You can own guns without being a gun nut
Maybe they weren’t talking about you then? Or you just want to tell on yourself
It's a hypothetical question, not a troll.
Locking weapons sounds reasonable. Talking to them... that's way too vague of an answer.
There are many options, everything between therapy to inpatient treatment facilities to surrendering him to the state.

But in this case, I think EC's mental health issues were made worse by his parents. And it's difficult to help a kid with severe issues when they are still living with abusive parents, especially if the parents are fighting against recommendations. 

With a kid like EC, he was too young to move out. And I think his parents were a major factor in how poor his health was. So that would require THEM to get help, do some introspection and improve their parenting. Maybe he'd have mental health problems even if they were perfect parents, but they clearly weren't. And they both seem very narcissistic so good luck on convincing either parents that they are part of the problem and need to change. Or good luck convincing them to admit their kid needs more help than they can manage. It's an ego thing. Their son getting help or them needing help would make them look less-than-perfect so they chose to just pretend it was all ok and ignore the problems hoping it'd just be fine. Obviously that didn't work.

I say this as someone who's own mental health journey started with an individual therapist who recommended a family therapist, who then recommend a couples therapist to my parents, who then recommended my Mom go back into individual therapy. Eventually my own therapist advocated to have me move out at 18 because my Mom was constantly disrupting my treatment plan and coping skills and continuing abusive behavior. I was very low-functioning at the time but even my therapist knew struggling on my own would be easier than staying with people that were actively hindering my progress. I thought it was hilarious at the time that all these professionals basically boiled down my issues into my parents having a shitty marriage and my Mom being kinda awful. But her ego was just too big for her to accept any blame or need to change. I highly suspect EC's parents are similar in this way, but likely much worse since they didn't even get Ethan into any treatment at all. 

(P. S. My mental health is still kinda shitty but moving out made a MASSIVE difference and allowed me to finally make progress. So if you're reading this and can relate please know it can get better. Getting away from living with abusive people was vital but it made a huge difference.)
What kind of dystopia is this omg
It's a good day for Michigan, and therefore the world!
Gun manufacturers are just as much to blame. They should be held liable every time there’s a mass shooting
The south laughs at such things. The republican controlled states are going to make it so parents cannot be held liable for their minor children's actions.
Eh both sides got stuff omitted and a lot that would help the prosecution case though. I remember reading about the stuff like EC killing baby birds, texts, social posts, witnesses and more were omitted from the prosecutions side. If theres a retrial, isn’t there a chance that stuff gets in too? Would the judge be different?
[deleted]
Her depraved indifference as the legal caretaker of a vulnerable minor doesn't make it prejudicial at all, imho. If anything,  she needs to be thankful for the aspects they couldn't bring up.
It certainly wouldn't surprise me if the verdict against Jennifer Crumbley gets rescinded.
My understanding is that what is and is not admissible as evidence is generally appealable, but not usually overturned unless the judge grossly violated the rules of evidence or used grossly biased discretion. I think appellate courts generally give a great amount of discretion to the trial judge generally in their discretion if it's justified well enough in the pre-trial motions. 

I don't think that an appeals court is going to disagree with the district court judge on the evidence presented, but I do agree that it is the defense's best appealable motion.

As a gun owner, what both parents did was not just get in trouble for their son's behavior. 

That is disingenuous and not at all what happened in this case.

They are in legal jeopardy because they specifically enabled him by buying him the gun (you need to be 18 to legally buy a handgun in Michigan). They did this whilst also knowing he had mental health issues.

Not securing it such that he could not get the weapon without their supervision and permission. 

And lastly, actively ignoring multiple chances and warnings to avoid the shooting. 

It's a classic example of negligence and poor gun ownership. I keep my guns and ammo locked in a safe only I have access to because I am responsible for what happens with them. I paid for them. It's my background check and name tied to the serial number. 

Both parents are the least responsible gun owners and bona fide example of exactly what not to do if you own firearms.
If my kids do anything without my permission it won't be with my firearms, because I keep them locked up in a storage facility away from the house.
If he pleads guilty without a trial, some experts say the judge may be more favorable to him during sentencing.
They probably buy into what Republicans say about the Border, and thought it would be really simple to just strut their asses into Canada illegally.
I remembered hearing back then that they had tried to get in to Canada but were rejected because they weren’t vaccinated. But then I hadn’t heard that again so I wasn’t sure if that was some rumor running wild. I can totally see them being anti vaxxers, the mom wrote some dumb post praising Trump up and down.
The links are in the article. It's revealed during Jennifer's testimony with the prosecution. I watched on YouTube personally, there's a ton of the court videos there.
Yeah, but they were, because they know they did something wrong. Ban all guns.
Idk it feels like 80/20 - 80% the parents and 20% the people in the schools. Maybe 90/10 but I feel strongly it can’t just be one or the other. In this case yes the school was doing everything in their power (their 10-20%) but some schools don’t and that’s where it’s not *only* the parents. Just my 2¢ of course. I’m fairly sure for this case no one is blaming the school because it was so dang obvious they were trying.
It's a bit of both in this case. I blame the parents way more, but the school should have checked his bag for a weapon and insisted his parents take him out of school. At the very least they shouldn't have allowed him to go back to class.

The parents really caused all this. But the school dropped the ball on some pretty basic fail-safe procedures.
I think there's a very good chance he will. Her sentencing hearing isn't scheduled until April, but if I was him I'd take this as a sign and try to get a deal. Of the two of them I do think he was more criminally liable (even though she was too) so he could be seeing a lengthy sentence if he's convicted.
She went to shooting range with him also. Isn’t there a video or FaceCrack photos?
I agree, he is definitely more guilty.
100%
Because mothers are usually held to be the main provider of their child’s emotional well being. At which she failed miserably. Kids journal says she laughed at him when he asked for help. Sounds like she was the main breadwinner and for that she wanted to be left to her affair and her horse riding. Dad provided the gun and his piss poor securing of that gun lead to the shooting. Neither of these two geniuses thought after seeing his drawings that they should check to see if the gun was still secured at home nor to inform the school that whoops maybe we messed up buying him a gun a few days ago or taking him to the shooting range.
If you're going to screw up, do it at work.
So I am a mental health therapist and almost became a school counselor until I found out 90% of the focus is on testing/college.  That's it.  Due to funding considerations.  This is where the schools want them to focus and so general mental health concerns often fall through the cracks.  Not enough in school budgets to have more counselors so all school counselors are stretched thin.  My son's school has one mental health specialist and two counselors for 750 kids.
One problem is that there is little funding left over to hire the number of counselors that are actually needed.
Oh I didn’t realize that they got fired. I guess that’s something.
total credential revocation of all employees involved. They've demonstrated that they can't be trusted to keep children safe and shouldn't be in positions of authority over children since they've displayed their inability or unwillingness to protect children over routine.
Civil.
He was sentenced to life with no possibility of parole. He is not getting out of jail.
Well if I was a lawyer, if the parents were held accountable for a minor, and the kid charged as an adult, there is a problem. If both parents get convicted, this kid needs to be tried as a child.
Hey got life without parole
A shirt made of hair. It's a Bible thing
Something extremely uncomfortable.
People wore hair shirts as a sign of repentance for their sins. Think like the worst scratchy wool shirt on steroids.  You wore it against bare skin, and it would almost drive you mad.

It was a visual aid for people knowing you f cked up and where trying to make amends with God. The misery was to remind you of what you did, and spur you on to do better.
Inquiring minds want to know...
That lawyer stole her money then. I don't know how looking like this is all a big ass inconvenience is gonna sway jurors to your side.
She definitely made no effort to dress or even comb her hair…unless you call that one tendril a style. Packed on a few pounds too, but I’m sure jail food isn’t too nutritional. 
She’s not attractive to begin with, but maybe her ding dong lawyer wanted her to appear broke and unkempt. A dress would have been better than ill fitting pants and loose ugly tops.
It's true though, I feel like it's pretty basic knowledge that you're supposed to clean yourself up for a court appearance on any level, but especially something involving a felony, or you know, multiple homicides. And TIL you can get chunky in jail - I always figured it would be the opposite, what with limited food intake and and numerous reasons to maintain/improve one's fitness level.

> Parents can't easily access mental health reaources for themselves when needed... especially families that come from similar means as the Crumbleys.

Which similar means is that? The kind that can afford 2 horses, horse boarding, riding lessons, multiple guns, drugs and alcohol? She was offered insurance for Ethan at work and didn't take it.
arguably the kid's mental health wouldn't have been so bad if they actually paid attention to him. there's mounds of research on how damaging straight up ignoring your child is to their mental health. sure -- some mental illness is just born into you -- but more often than not it has to be activated by trauma.   


sometimes the "mental  health resource" is literally just being a functioning family.
Um, you aren’t always liable when your dog bites someone either. You can be criminally liable sometimes, civilly liable sometimes, and not liable at all sometimes. 

That’s a terrible analogy given how much case law exists for it. You’re just wrong on your point, you aren’t always liable or responsible for the actions of someone else, even if they’re your kid. Parents are caretakers and guardians, not wardens or dictators.
April.
Not true. Try google.
Ah gotcha, that makes sense.
Because details and facts matter?

If the kid hid their mental health and the parents had literally 0 involvement in obtaining the weapon, they don't have responsibility in the crime?

These parents essentially gave the damn weapon to their kid who had told them he was having violent hallucinations and mental health problems??!?
Good for you but Not all teachers are smart enough or caring enough to report warning signs and even the ones that are aren’t always taken seriously.
And when would a reporter be able to get that information from the jury?
“The first type of involuntary manslaughter occurs when a defendant recklessly or negligently commits an act that results in the death of another person. Recklessness usually means that the defendant was aware of the risk that they were creating, while negligence usually means that the defendant was not aware of the risk but reasonably should have been aware of it. The level of negligence required for involuntary manslaughter is higher than normal civil negligence and requires that the defendant have acted in a very unreasonable manner. The exact language used to describe this negligence standard varies by state, but many refer to it as “criminal negligence” or “gross negligence.”

Seems like they got it right. Maybe, just maybe, people who facilitate the actions of murderers should be held liable for the results of the criminal actions.
Ah yes, my comment only insults you and doesn't have a single merit to it

Doing a great job to prove you aren't gaslighting and have actual arguments rather than just publicly whining that bad people had bad things happen to them
Except that the voices that Johnsons hearing are real, coming as they are from Mar-a-Lago Fla
We need to start treating people who “hear” god speaking to them the same way as anyone else with a mental illness. Does Harry Potter speak to you, too, Speaker Johnson???
[deleted]
Here is the problem I have. The school did not say - you MUST take your son home. If the school thought it was ok for the kid to stay how can we put more on the mom? On the day of the shooting neither of the parents or the school realized he had a gun in his backpack.

Interesting commentary on case by defense attorney - https://youtu.be/BYpx2qSdKPo?si=xnvpwvZPLct1WnZ9
Yeah... if you search the last name and "dead bird," many articles pop up which give more context.
Still it shows you made an attempt to keep it safe. It's not much but every obstacle placed in the path is a chance that they might turn away from the path they're on.
I use one. I keep my guns in my gun cabinet with trigger locks on them. The only one that has the cable lock is my shotgun witch I just got and just haven't got the trigger lock yet for it. But it is still locked in the gun cabinet.
Wasn't the cable lock still in its original unopened bag shown as an exhibit?
Majority of gun owners are responsible. It’s like cops a few bad eggs ruins is for everyone. 

Really, just lock up your guns folks. I have 4 myself. All four of them are locked in my safe which is in my office where I spend at least 40 some hours of my week.
"gun nut" is widely used to describe anyone who advocates for the 2A, that might not be how you use it but thats how its generally used. That said the mother is getting what she deserves
I'd rather not..... youtube comments are a cesspool at the best of times.
They're probably all hyperventilating that this verdict is an evil plot by Communist Deep State operatives financed by George Soros to deprive "red-blooded Christian Conservative PATRIOTS!!" of their 2nd Amendment rights.
Yep, I know 3 people I would consider normal law abiding citizens that own guns, and three that are gun nuts.

Three of them have gun safes and use reasonable precautions to keep them away from people that shouldn't possess them. Some of them even have quick release gun safes stored underneath their beds for emergency situations.

The others do things like put a loaded pistol under their pillow, and post unhinged rants on social media. I do not like to be around those people.

My child is a teenager in Scouts and I would consider taking them to the local gun range and do some training. With some gun rentals. Even buying a gun and keeping it stored on site there. I would not keep the gun in my house under any circumstance.
As is tradition.
Perfect. :D
Michigan vs Everybody...or wait...
I fully support the Crumbleys  being held responsible, but this is a preposterous statement.

A manufacturer has no bearing and no way to control 2 Idiot parents from giving a mentally unstable kid a gun.

This would be akin to somebody killing somebody driving, drunk and holding Ford motor company responsible.
Are they? If they gave the kid a car after saying he wanted to run down people in a car, would you be arguing that Ford is liable?
Your argument falls apart immediately, when asking, are car manufacturers at fault for purposeful death via vehicular manslaughter?






Should knife manufacturers be held accountable if one of their knives is involved in a stabbing?





Should Boeing/Airbus be held responsible for 9/11? 




Should Hasbro be held responsible because a child accidentally choked to death on a toy?





Just because a company manufactures an item that can be used dangerously, or against legislative guidelines and manufacturer recommended usage guidelines, doesn't mean _they're_ at fault.





Humans have control over their decision making, the gun didn't kill someone, the person holding it did. The car didn't kill someone, the person driving it did. The toy didn't purposefully lodge itself in the child's airway resulting in death, etc, ad nauseum. 





The last example is a bit extreme, but when looking at outlier, polar examples, it allows oneself to observe and self-regulate their beliefs, without only focusing on the emotional impact these conundrums resonate within each of us.
Did the fork make you fat, too? Those damn fork manufacturers enabled me to make poor decisions, I want  money!
Not sure I agree with that.

By that logic, why not go after the bullet manufacturers, for instance?

I might agree with holding a gun store accountable, in a case that they didn't do their due diligence, background check, or whatever the law requires. I don't think that's the case here, though.
The manufacturers are not at fault. By that logic every time any object is misused and causes harm the manufacturer is at fault. Half of the economy will go out of business at that rate. I'll blame my car manufacturer if I commit a traffic violation. They shouldn't have made it so the car could do that right?
Those are just all the more reasons the parents should have stepped in.
Uggh seriously baby birds? They would have voted guilty in 5 minutes if that came in.
It's possible.  But at that point what does she have to lose in a retrial?  She was already found guilty on all counts, so throwing a Hail Mary on getting the conviction overturned at worst nets them the same result.  It's not like her incarceration time hasn't been ticking down this entire time either.

It's possible that on a retrial they'd be able to get EC to testify (he didn't this time because of the current appeal his lawyer is filing), so I don't think that would help her case either.
I did not find the evidence prejudicial at all. It seemed pretty cut and dried that she was used to ignoring her son’s pleas for help. She was living her own life having affairs, orgies, riding her horses, etc. If your child came to you and said they needed mental help, would your reaction be to laugh? because that’s what this POS did. I hope she gets the maximum.
I understand your point and it's a scary revelation for parents.  However this case was not really about parental responsibility only.  It was the failure to act and her negligence. She knew that he had a gun.  She knew he was in pain.  She knew he was drawing  guns and messages about killing.  It was negligent of her to leave without- asking Ethan if he had gun.  Checking his backpack and clothes.  She could've stayed at the school and told her husband go home and see if the gun is there and the ammo.   She could've told the school he has a gun. Let's check his locker.   She couldn't wait to get out of there and neither of them went home to check to see if the gun was there.  They abandoned their son and didn't tell the school the important information that could've helped the school protect the other students.  I guarantee you if the parents told the school he has a gun they would have searched Ethan they had no reason to believe he had access to a gun.  The parents did.  This child was suffering and mentally ill and they rejected and abandoned him.  Changing one of these things and doing something different would have saved lives even taking Ethan home.  They deserve to be convicted.
To be fair though when they polled the jury so far, none have referenced that as the evidence that was the turning point in their decision making, which I think would be a factor in if they had a shot at appeals. They have referenced the evidence that Jennifer was likely the last person to have the gun before Ethan, as well as they noticed her lying on the stand, which is all admissible. Reminds me of the Chris Coleman case when the jury was actually hung for a while before deciding they had caught him in a lie, and if he was able to lie, he was able to commit the crime and lie about that. upon appeals it was determined they could use that as evidence in their decision making.
But the argument isn't that the shooting happened, or that her kid did it, or if they provided the gun.  

The argument is "could you see this coming, and did fuck all to prevent it"?
You can't even make your comment without bringing in your bias
She's a very unlikeable POS but...
Ethan was tried as an ADULT, so I don't see how you can have it both ways
Not in a million years. You're insane.
They also allowed Ethan's journal in as evidence, which he's made contradictory statements on, but due to Ethan's ongoing appeal the Defense wasn't able to call him in to cross-examine him on it.  

I don't think there's enough to successfully appeal, but I think that there's enough to warrant making one, meaning this is still going to drag out a while.
It was not hidden or secured. A picture of the lock still in its case and unopened was showed as an exhibit.
Bullshit. That cable lock was still in the package when it was shown in court. You don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
The kid testified when he pleaded guilty did the money used to purchase the weapon was his and that he gave it to his father to make the purchase.
Cool yeah the court videos on YouTube seem to be what I’m looking for, thank you!
Schools are afraid of parents.  They cater to their every whim.  Therein lies the problem.
The problem is going to be whether or not her lawyers are able to get appeals going.  I really think long-term it was a mistake to allow the witness to the shooting testimony as well as playing the videos.  

Yes it shows the gravity of her indifference to her son's mental state, but I don't think that's what should have been on trial. It was what happened leading up to the shooting.  Did they allow it to happen?  Did they encourage or enable it?  I think the answer to all three is a solid "yes", but the addition of the emotional witnesses kinda muddies the waters on the "fair" aspect of the trial.  I would have had zero problem with her having to face those at the sentencing as impact statements (which I'm sure they'll have people lined up out the door to give anyways).

 Any lawyer worth their salt would argue that it was prejudicial testimony that only served to inflame the jury's emotions.  I know it helped get the conviction, but I would absolutely hate to see these assholes walk or be granted a re-trial because of it.

Anyways hopefully this is done and over with, and we can forget these people exist.
The prosecution has said there’s no deals on offer for either of them. The best he can hope for is to spare the courts time and expense and plead guilty and hope that gets him leniency when he’s sentenced. Basically what his son did but he still got the max punishment so he’s prob not going to make the only move that might help himself.
They're appealing the ruling that allowed the Judge to sentence him as a minor to a life -sentence without the possibility of parole. 

If they win, it could end up 25-Life
Found this to be the most concerning thing about this.   Also that the prosecutor in Ethan’s case argued he was far more mentally advanced than normal 15 year olds.
That's an interesting point I hadn't considered, but if you loan your car to someone you know is about to go rob a convenience store, and they get caught. The cops trace the car back to you, should you share responsibility?
He and his lawyer are appealing that. It's why he wasn't compelled to testify at her trial, because he was going to plead the 5th against self-incrimination.
It's supposed to be uncomfortable, like a kind of mild self-imposed punishment.
Wow mind blown never heard of it. Thank you for the explanation. 🤯
Believe it or not there are people who still wear hair shirts for penance.
She was not well-served by the defense team in many respects.  Maybe that "hot mess" act has worked for Shannon Smith in the past, but it was a disaster here.
Yes, that too... at least I stand by my opinions.
Sorry for my ignorance of their exact financial situation. In her letter to her criminal idol Donald Trump she said she was supporting the family on a $40k salary.
So if your dog went into a school yard and started biting kids you’re saying they wouldn’t be liable seems hard to believe but you’re clearly the smart one in this conversation.
Sounds like a lot of bs to worry about when you can just lock ‘em up. Any minor charged with a gun crime should get their parents locked up.
You don’t need to you just need to pay attention to the evidence presented at trial and summarize the highlights. The jury likely concluded that because she did A, B, and C, she was guilty.
> negligence usually means that the defendant was not aware of the risk

There is simply no good reason to lock up someone on negligence if this is the definition.
Please google gaslighting
As opposed to the huge echo chamber in Brandon's head occasionally filled with instructions of his handlers to change his depends. 😂
Not politics:  Johnson claimed "God" spoke to him & told him he was the new Moses. Just as delusional as Ethan thinking demons flushed a toilet.
Likely because they don’t post threads. 

I’ve been here maybe 12 years and posted maybe 6 things ever (feel free to examine my profile) and they were all banal shit that I could just as easily not have posted.
She had cumulative knowledge of his behavior.   The lover texted her that morning and asked where the gun was.  That happened when she told him she had to go to school. She lied and said it was in her car.  It is, to me, a hundred things she could have done along the way which would have changed the path shooter was on.
As the prosecutor said, he literally drew them a picture of what he was going to do and they ignored it. Nor did they tell the school officials that he had a gun. These piss poor parents are 100% guilty and deserve the maximum sentence.
The parents (theoretically) spend significantly more time with their child than any school administrative staff.

They should have known he wasn’t ok despite what the school may have thought.

In a similar scenario, if the gym teacher tells you your kid is fine after falling, yet when they are at home you have additional details of a serious injury and choose to ignore it and not take the child to the doctor or urgent care, it’s on you as a parent, not the gym teacher.
It would be better if households where anyone in the family was mentally unstable to just not buy guns to begin with -- too much can go wrong. And they're more likely to fall victim to being shot -- whether deliberately or accidentally -- by some family member than by some hypothetical home invaders.
>Majority of gun owners are responsible. It’s like cops a few bad eggs ruins is for everyone.

This right here is the problem. Most actually aren't. It's not like the only gun problem we are facing is mass shootings. There's guns that are stored improperly that are then stolen and used in a crime. It's guns that children have access to which often results in (atleast) an accidental shooting. At worst, murder. It's the amount of untrained morons accidentally shooting their guns while cleaning. Etc, etc, etc.

&#x200B;

I used to be a huge gun nut myself. Because of this, I befriended a bunch of people at the range, and in my personal life who would tell you that they are "Responsible gun owners". Almost all of them, in some way, weren't. Don't get me wrong, they exist. I know this because I know a few of them. But at this point, even the ones I know have started to say "There's no such thing as a responsible gun owner". There's just to many idiots who don't get any training, have lack of common sense, have lack of self control or all of the above.
You probably know a lot more than three gun owners who are not gun nuts. The responsible majority quietly have them and keep them locked up and treat them as the dangerous tools that they are, without ever needing to tell anyone.
“Is it…YES! The Lower Peninsula has just ripped off the U.P. and is shoving it up the shooters parents ass! AS. IS. TRADITION!”
Detroit vs Everybody
Though I don’t hold ultra-conservative views on guns for the most part, I’d have to agree the manufactures really aren’t liable for anything.  They are making legal products that people love to buy.  It’s not like they’re marketing to kids.  It’s the culture of gun worship that ruins it all.
This is a good point....and I'm not a gun nut.

When did he say he wanted to kill people?
Forks aren’t designed to kill people they’re designed to eat food. It’s not really that hard
> why not go after the bullet manufacturers, for instance?

Good idea, honestly.
Bad grammar, meant the prosecutions case. Edited

The lockers were off limits to avoid surface contamination with the COVID virus so there would have been no need to search his locker.
They were charged with the final result. The jury apparently agreed that they may have seen it coming, in which case prejudice may be hard to prove.
As the prosecutor said, he literally drew them a roadmap of what he was planning to do on that math test. And they refused to take him home. This makes them absolutely culpable.
Comments are opinions. Opinions are, by definition,  biased.
I’m no lawyer but taking a plea usually means no appeals, Ethan plead guilty so what exactly is he appealing? The life sentence?

The Court TV ones were annoying imo, just thought I'd warn you. They liked to stop and tell you their opinion on whatever was happening every few minutes.
Good analysis! The questions the jury asked the court while deliberating has me worried... wanting to make assumptions about things not introduced into evidence means there were gaps in proving the elements of the crime. If those gaps were filled in with emotion from hearing about/seeing the shooting... they definitely have grounds for appeal.

Hopefully all the charges stick.
Ah, I misread your earlier comment. He did plea guilty but he was never offered any plea deals, so I think it will be a very difficult appeal, especially since his guilty plea included terrorism charges.
But even if they win, what parole board is going to let him out after 25 years?
If they can prove you knowingly gave someone the tools to commit a crime you can absolutely be charged as an accomplice.
Yes if they've been talking about robbing that convenience store and had a plan for months.

This was a really wholesome exchange. I like seeing people learning new things. [You're one of today's lucky 10,000!](https://xkcd.com/1053/) :)

Her horse obsession was expensive. That’s why rich kids can afford it. What was she thinking? Spent 5k buying one horse. Does anyone know if she has always been into horses? Or was this just a recent hobby?
I didn’t say that. But even in your example it would depend. If someone else let your dog out, no, you wouldn’t be liable.
Locking them up is not a solution, the goal is to prevent these horrific acts no? and the way we do that is punish and make an example out of the people who let their kids do this by ignoring them and enabling them
“For Crumbley to be guilty of involuntary manslaughter, the jurors had to determine that she caused the deaths of those students by either failing to provide reasonable care or being grossly negligent in providing care.

“Those theories are two different ways to prove the same crime,” Judge Cheryl A. Matthews said. “Either or both of these theories, if proven, are sufficient to establish the crime of involuntary manslaughter.”
Reasonable care involves a parent’s duty to take action to control a child when it’s necessary to prevent harm. Gross negligence means “willfully disregarding the results to others that might result from an act or failure to act.”

In other words, prosecutors had to show that Crumbley knew or should have known that her son was a danger to others and taken action to prevent him from being able to take that harmful action.”

You sure you’re a lawyer?
You mean like negligently providing access to a firearm?
Let's see here.... Your original rant was how this was specifically an attack on citizens for the crimes of others which is objectively not true.  That is literally the point of the trial, to prove they are just as accountable as their child which has never happened before in this country.  The very charges they were trying to prove go against that statement

Yet you state this is not the case.  So you denied reality and called for attention to this 'injustice'.  IE manipulating the narrative to misrepresent something.  How is this not gas lighting?


Now sure, there's a solid argument I'm doing that myself.  But since you continue to not actually have a response, what else am I supposed to do except infer?  If I'm incorrect in any of my assumptions that's exactly why I listed everything off so you can easily debunk me.  But instead of doing that, you hide behind accusations and 'try Google'
[deleted]
The jury agreed with you.
See that is something that in my own experience is what normal people do. For example when my uncle had a stroke and was confined to a wheel chair the guns were removed from his house before he went back there.

I have no evidence but in my personal opinion I think they were hoping the kid would kill would kill himself and that's why they bought the thing and were so blase about storing it.
The problem here is actually the wildly inaccurate assumptions you’re making, speaking in a manner of fact way, and painting the overall population with those generalizations as the people you’ve “met” or interacted with. 

You’re also pulling increasingly low occurrence situations out of thin air and treating them as daily occurrences.

In actuality, the Crime Research Prevention Center’s study found that among police, firearms violations occur at a rate of 16.5 per 100,000 officers. 

“With about 685,464 full-time police officers in the U.S. from 2005 to 2007, we find that there were about 103 crimes per hundred thousand officers,” the report reads. “For the U.S. population as a whole, the crime rate was 37 times higher—3,813 per hundred thousand people.”


Among permit holders in Florida and Texas, the rate is only 2.4 per 100,000.10. 

As a whole, the general population of permitted pistol carriers commits crimes at a significantly lower rate than police, which do so at a significantly lower rate than the general population. 

The idea that gun owners are shooting each other regularly, or anything else, while cleaning, is unsubstantiated paranoia.

That’s not excusing or saying that children don’t get access to guns that they shouldn’t, and it’s not pretending that guns don’t get stolen either. 

Those scenarios are important to prevent, but it’s also important to understand how often they happen in the first place, which you’re highly exaggerating.
I may know more than that, but I'm talking about friends and family.

The people whose houses I visit I make sure I know what kind of guns they have and how they store them.

If it's a random person I interact with at work, it doesn't really matter to me or my family, aside from people like the Crumbles.
First few words.. alright this is funny







Last few words.... eh they lost me, not funny anymore





I'm curious, what was the direction of this comment? Shitting on trolls?
they do. They literally do exactly this. do you know how much auto manufacturers spend lobbying the government a year?

there are already several steps in place that a person goes through to obtain a gun. the biggest of which is a background check. this check includes things like criminal offenses and forced mental health care. manufacturers also can not ship a gun to a standard address, it mush be shipped to an FFL (Federal Firearm License) business where you go to fill out the paperwork for the purchase, conduct the background check and then pick up the gun. FFL licensing is directly organized and managed by the ATF, and receiving one involves several months or years of paperwork and background checks, keeping exact and accurate records for every single purchase conducted for several years after and even a single mistake in paperwork (much less directly breaking the law) will result in loss of license and federal criminal charges. so no FFL is ever going to break or bend the rules to make a sale, and neither are the manufacturers.

add into this that a majority of manufacturers get their profits from military contracts, civilian sells are just icing on their cake.

there was a point in time when machine guns were sold in the sears catalog and shipped directly to your house, and there weren't any mass shootings. (first recognized shooting was in 1949, 15 years after the national firearms act of 1934. the guns are the tool, it's society that has created people who wish to hurt, maim, and kill others on a mass scale.
No, actually: terrible idea which has a zero percent chance of any kind of legal success.
You're wrong. Her actions and her husband's actions after the shooting are very incriminating. They attempted to elude the police when they knew they had supplied the gun and ammunition for a mass shooting. That evidence reveals that they knew they were guilty.
[removed]
Depends on the feed you look at. The ones provided by local TV outlets were generally all trial live and no commentary during trial or at breaks. CourtTV and Law and Crime channels different matter.
You seem unnecessarily perturbed by my initial comment. Kind of have to question where your sympathy lies in a case like this where innocent life was lost so senselessly. Go off, I guess? Defend those school shooters to the death, if you must, guy.
Well that just doesn’t track  with what happened I guess you’ll always have an excuse just don’t have kids, so you don’t have to blame the kid for the way you raised them.
Yeah when I said the article listed the elements, that’s exactly the text I am referencing. None of that is interesting to me, because I am indeed a lawyer. They list what needs to be proven. That’s what the article says. The article does NOT say how it was proven. Do you argue on Reddit to get a rise? I’m confused as to why you take umbrage here. Did you write the article?

A good article says “they need to prove this, here is the evidence presented to prove this, and the jury found that it was proven”. They left out step 2.
Does that change the definition?
Well for starters. You can't gaslight someone in a single instance. Gaslighting takes a long time and requires you to lie so often that the person begins to not trust their own memory or even their own perception. 

I also don't understand your argument, it sounds like you are using circular logic to me. The court is right because the court said it was right?
He’s a crazy and dangerous person (like Ethan) being enabled by stupid and malicious people (like Ethan’s parents)
[removed]
My guns are safely stored away out of sight, and most of my friends never know. I’ll tell anyone who *asks*, and show them if they want and all that. I’ve hosted shooting parties at my place. But maybe 1 in 5 friends that come visit know, because I don’t volunteer “There are firearms in this house but you would have literally no way of knowing or of coming across them or being able to access them if you came across them” to everyone who visits me.
It’s a rephrasing of a line in the episode of south park that the people above me are quoting.

The prince rips the princess’s arm off and shoves it up his own ass, as is tradition.
If I went and cut a hole in your fence, and your dogs got out and attacked someone, why would you be liable? You had your dogs fenced in. 

Same token, if I didn’t keep guns around and I got my child therapy, but they went and stole someone else’s guns and used those in a crime, how would I be liable? 

You painted with too broad of a brush. There are limits to what you can hold someone liable for. The parents here are liable because they provided the guns and ignored warning signs. No one is arguing against that. But that’s not always what happens. Sometimes parents do the right things and children still do heinous things. You can’t just say it’s always the parents too.
Honestly - I don’t think you’re a lawyer. That why I’m continuing to converse. I think your initial ‘complaint’ that this is a ‘dogshit article’ and then to clarify that your found it frustrating/boring because it didn’t examine ‘what the jury may have found negligent’ when the article was released in almost real-time for when the case was decided is weird. Almost Boomerish. You wanted an in depth explanation why the jury found her guilty of involuntary manslaughter when the case was decided?
Your comprehension is blinded by your bias. 

Her negligence, providing access to a firearm for an individual that was not legally allowed to have one, enabled the school shooting to happen. That school shooting resulted in the death of four people. 

If you want to try and continue to insinuate she did not contribute directly to the actions her son took that day or classify her actions as reasonable and unavoidable, don’t bother replying. Your inability to objectively construct any response based on facts or reality is impossible.
And with the information age and online forums it's entirely possible to state something in one place and have that get repeated elsewhere with no checks and soon it gains it's own life.  You are not the first person to make that claim, you won't be the last.  Sure, maybe this was the first time you physically typed out that idea, but if an individual user continues to see multiple opinions scattered throughout Reddit that contradicts events ... That user would begin to question their own perception and memory.  

I count your contribution as part of that effort.  By definition your individual action may not be, but it can have that effect when taking other comments and posts in consideration.  If we agree to disagree on that, so be it 


As for my argument, I'm saying a **jury** found her guilty.  It was the prosecutions job to prove their case, it was up to the defense to stop it.  The court is 'right' because the system did exactly what it was supposed to and a jury of peers decided.

I don't even know where the court being right enters into this.  If you're trying to say the court is wrong because the jury used emotional reasoning instead of listening to the legal arguments, you're basically claiming jury nullification.  That's a wild accusation.  There is disagreement over what appeared at trial and there's been several comments on how some evidence was prejudicial and we'll all have to wait and see how the appeal plays out.  I'm hoping you're claiming this was emotional jury nullification because I have no idea what else you would be trying to claim.  

In the mean time, she literally had her day in court.  And lost.  For all we know it's as equally likely someone on the jury was convinced this was an illegal retribution and was convinced by the prosecution to change their mind, as it is likely someone didn't really care until the trial started and seeing how 'bad' she was decided she needed to be punished regardless of legality
Removed. See rule #4 in the [r/Michigan subreddit rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Michigan/wiki/index#wiki_rules).
Hilarious that you can’t have an adult discussion without throwing out multiple insults. 

Sorry if the data upsets you. I wasn’t the one who formulated an opinion and tried to present it as fact.
If your dog gets out and seriously maims or injures somebody youre being held liable just FYI dude. Its not going to matter how it got out.
It does, actually. You obviously don’t know the first thing about liability. And you’re being willfully ignorant. I’m not wasting any more time on you.
Lower Midwest lol
I laughed too hard at this 😂

I’ve been referring to Michigan as part of the Great Lakes region. And if they called the other stuff the Great Plains region, it would eliminate this association between the two dissimilar areas.
It needs a party store and a bar
I hate this outdated notion that everyone from the Midwest lives on a farm. I'm in Michigan, so the stereotype is that we're all a bunch of gun nuts.
Most of Michigan was covered by white pines and logged out, they replanted a lot of those trees years ago... but they did replant a lot of them
Northern Michigan is similar. So many dollar general's; I don't go to them, but I do notice them all over the place.
You need a church in there
Southern Michigan is farm land, get around Grayling you are getting into the pines and up north 👍
Shame that mega corp ruined alot of small towns around the state.
and then narcan billboards.
"Jesus: Are you on the right road?"
Meh.... That feels more like Ohio than Michigan.
This is why it’s so important to stop and pick up those yellow plastic bags when you see them blowing down the road. All it takes is for one to take root and boom, another DG pops up.
Lake, highway, corn fields, lake, random college, lake, cornfield. Repeat
Used to enjoy going to different towns for the little hobby shops, five and dimes and used books stores. Now it's the same crap town after town.
It's so sad. I love driving through quaint little towns all around Michigan and it makes me so sad to see multiple businesses close down while I see some big ugly yellow and black sign light up the roadway as I drive by. I hope they get punished big time for overcharging customers over the years with faulty advertising compared to when you look at your bill after you check out. At the very very least these bastards could at least make their sign more beautiful and not just some big ugly yellow block. When I see it I feel like I'm diving directly into the nastiest trailer park of all time and it's just despicable that all these towns have even let these idiotic stories come in. They're literally is no price difference they only barely beat out these crappy gas stations that are charging too much for Frito chip dip and other crap. Shaking my head as a Michigan near my whole life.
Well, this *is* what it feels like to drive through Ohio, so...yeah.

Also, I went to Virginia for Blue Ridge Rock Fest last year (yes, it was terrible), and the tiny town (population 2200, lol) where they held it, was literally this.

In the middle of nowhere, with pitch black back roads for miles in every direction, but especially around the race track that served as the festival grounds, and a gas station and a dollar store in the town center.  

I have never seen as many dollar stores as I have on my drive through Virginia, and I live in fucking Michigan.
Forgetting the billboards filled with religion right next to one's for gun, sex, and weed stores.
I hate dollar stores. I swear they're always dirty AF, unorganized, and there's always some poor overworked person in there that is literally working register, stocking, and doing everything all at once because they don't hire anyone. Half the time you have to go find them and let them know you're ready to check out because they'll be halfway across the store doing something else. 

It makes it even more sad because I know rural people who's houses are literally just stocked with garbage DG food and don't even eat any produce because they can't be bothered to drive 20 miles to a real grocery store.
Where’s the dirty Burger King? Where’s the competing gas stations? The mysterious Chinese buffet? We have a culture, sweaty.
There’s no sun

One of those fields would be soy beans it's not Iowa after all.
There will be a few less Dollar stores and some empty real estate soon.
Ahh yes, the great dg plague
Every other field is soy beans, give me a break.
When I lived in Ottawa IL this is all there was for miles and I hated it. I will never go back. Ever.
Ope!
Nah, that dollar general should be down the street from split dollar tree-family dollar.  

Can anyone name that city?
You forgot the church's 🙄
Lots and lots of meth
I swear some towns you can't even go 2 miles in any direction without seeing some type of dollar store.
I mean.. to be fair if your not on the coast line it’s pretty true just wheat and beans along with the corn
Fr, I'm a Midwesterner and I'm convinced at this point they're dropping Dollars Generals from Helicopters all over the place.
How dare you forget the Vape shops and payday loan shops!
I still wanna know how we’re the midwest.
I can see my house!
You took a picture of my town
Forgot to include the meth lab next to the dollar general.
6 DGs in my hometown

Looks like my town of Rudyard. Just recently got a Dollar General there now.
Gotta include that poor people infrastructure.
Dollar General is a predatory corporation ruining the Midwest with this jokingly real amount of market saturation.
Not sure where this is but it ain’t Michigan, this is someone who’s been to Iowa and drew a picture of Iowa
Im from Detroit ..been up north many times ..its not really like this at all granted its been 20 years since ive been up north but yeah sure it hasnt changed theres usually a bar not a dollar store
This doesn’t remind me of Michigan
Michigan is more city and urban like, there is not as many farms as in other midwestern states if I'm correct
The Cross in the Woods is a Catholic shrine located on M-68 in Indian River, Michigan. It was declared a national shrine by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops in 2006. At 55 feet tall, it is the second largest crucifix in the world.

The King of Kings statue, also known as "Big Butter Jesus" and "Touchdown Jesus", **was** a 62-foot tall statue of Jesus located on I75 at Solid Rock Church. The statue was made of styrofoam with a thin fiberglass skin, which gave it a yellowish tint, leading people to call it "Big Butter Jesus
Driving from Muskegon to Saginaw to visit my grandparents, I feel this.
So glad i live in a spot thats not there
So true… lol

Dollar General doesn't sell drugs duh lol
Poison, poison, poison, and a box of hot garbage.  Nice

The true up north is the U.P. A lot come from the lower peninsula and get pissed... but they don't mind the money lol
Michigan is so ugly jesus
Side note, reminded me of the lamest city tagline ever:

> Rochester, where you live

Yeah in the branding the emphasis is on *live* as an action verb but in text it’s just comically straightforward
Was my first thought of how much of IN looks like this.
I like the "Marriage is between a man and a woman!"
Dollar General preys on the people who live where it's too rural for even a Walmart. They thrive in low income food deserts since their overhead is so low and they overwork their employees so much that you don't need that large of a community to make it viable. They choke out smaller local grocers and then don't provide these communities they infect with the sorts of healthy food and produce which include the nutrients needed to live a healthy life. But when the alternative is driving 3x as far to the nearest Walmart or Meijer, many people just come to rely on the dollar store which is slowly killing them. 

If a Dollar General opens in your community, your community is likely in trouble.
Because that is what cancer does:  it chokes out the good and spreads.   They are THE WORST and should be banned.
Because it's late stage capitalism doing it's thing.

Dollar store items are more expensive per-unit, but people are so poor they have no fucking choice.

Dollar stores are a sign of economic desperation.
We have just as much corn and meth as every other Midwestern state!
This is what a lot of rural Michigan looks like though, especially between like Lansing and Pontiac, south of M59
I mentioned this in a different thread and got downvoted. Like Michigan has very little in common with Nebraska.
Quit fucking telling people that it’s nice here 😂
This is literally what southern Michigan looks like though
The great lakes is a sub region of the Midwest.
And, at this point, a fucking brewery.
And anyone who lives in Michigan knows it's more trees than fields anyway
I hate that the internet has perpetuated the idea of calling Kansas, Nebraska and the Dakotas “the Midwest.” We have about as much in common with Nebraska as we do the moon.
I live in northern michigan and considering the price of fresh produce I started gardening and I have chickens. This year will be onions, potatoes, tomatoes, turnips, cantaloupe, watermelon, honeydew, peppers, corn, beets, beans and I'm pretty sure I'm missing some. Last year was a terrible crop; I hope this year does better.

And I wouldn't say my bf is a "nut" more like an "enthusiast".
I live near and around farms so this is accurate for me
Northern Lower Trolls and Yoopers probably have more incentive for "gun nuttery" (enthusiasm for the shooting sports, trap and skeet, bullseye competition, IPSC, cowboy action shooting, etc.) just because of there being more open land and forest.
I think Family Dollar is a little better.
A couple of them.
Southern Michigan farmland seems much more south than Grayling.
And megachurch billoards. And porn shop billboards. And gun store billboards. I drove through the Midwest once and there were so many billboards.
Big Box Restauarant Chains in Michigan should not be opened.  A small breakfast-through-lunch cafe, old-fashioned travel plaza, or ma-and-pa grocery store in a well-traveled-yet-tiny-junction-stop-burg are all acceptable.  This is imperative if you don't want to have marijuana fumes permeating your down town.

My old home town went through this.  The LaSenorita, Ruby Tuesdays, and Ponderosa all closed and are now pot houses.

The transformation fungus that grows under these things is fast, tenacious, and weedy! ;-)

I know!  You aren’t alone. Why Michigan is Considered Midwest When it’s Barely ‘Mid’ and Not at All ‘West’ 

**Until the 1980s, we were in the region known as the North Central Region.** There is also a bi-national area considered the Great Lakes region that includes Pennsylvania, New York, and Ontario. So we're part of that too.

Where are you from?? 

Due to population density in Michigan’s biggest cities, **~94% of those those state's land mass is considered rural**, including MOST of northern Lower Peninsula and ALL of Upper Peninsula. 

1.8 million residents **(20% Michigan’s population) live in rural areas**, according to USDA classifications.

You haven't been to Sleeping Bear?
If I die in Rochester, I’m gonna sue
Rochester - where cougars roam.
From Indiana, can confirm.

Unfortunately, I also see it in lower Michigan too. Indiana is leaking. Build the wall!!! /s
Last sentence is spot on. Incoming Dollar Tree/General means that they’ve identified your community as failing, which is their bread and butter.
Dollar general opened up 3 stores in my town in the last 3 years. Right next to 4 other dollar generals that are across the Stateline.
Well said, it’s really sad losing the local ma’ & pa’ shops that have been around for decades. 

The health part is the same idea as a brisk tea that has 70+ grams of sugar costing 99¢ while a bottle of aquafina using the exact same water cost $2-4.

> If a Dollar General opens in your community, your community is likely in trouble.

idk, they're just everywhere. Even in my community, which also has a walmart, and a meijer, and a local grocery store, there's still like 3 dollar generals around.
Dollar General is a criminal organization.  The food deserts are only part of it.  They deliberately understaff their stores, pay minimium wage, and neglect maintenance to undercut the competition and put them out of business.  Then they intentionally overcharge their customers over advertised prices because they make hundreds of millions a year doing it and the fines tiny and nobody is held criminally liable for them.
The city of Chicago had to pass a law preventing dollar general from opening a store within a mile of another dollar general.  This isn't rural or small community exclusive lol
And cannabis!
But we also have blueberries, cherries, asparagus, apples, hops, sugar beets... Tons of unique and delicious horticultural crops are grown here in acreage that is bested by only California in some cases. Iowa would kill for our sugar beets, I know I've been there.
As a Chicago native, I believe that the apple, pear & cherry orchards, as well as the blueberry farms make up for a LOT of that.     


Hey, Mods!  Can I get "chicagoin that loves the ~~east~~  West corridor" as my flair?

This is what a lot of rural everywhere looks like.
The Dakotas, Nebraska, and Kansas DO NOT consider themselves part of the Midwest, and they will tell you so. I think the Plains states are more arid and have a lot more grassland/prairies, and a lot fewer lakes and wooded areas.

I think of the Midwest as Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and Michigan.
And a weed shop or six
>We have about as much in common with Nebraska as we do the moon.

Great Lakes Great Times
In some ways it makes more sense to call them that than here.  We are still in eastern time (if you head straight south you hit the Carolinas), have more in common with Buffalo than we do with St. Louis, and our cultural and economic "elite" can definitely find common ground with their east coast counterparts more than they can with wealthy Omahans or Topekans.  Our forests have most of the same biome features that you can find through Northern New England, minus the Appalachian rhododendron and Atlantic tree and shrub species.

In terms of history, while the French did range far to the west in terms of economic activities, they settled largely east of the Mississippi in those long lines stretching out from the rivers just as they did in Quebec.  Our indigenous peoples were largely Anishinaabe and had cultural and economic connections headed easterly rather than much further west than the Mississippi river.  Our regional variation of American English has much more in common with upstate New York than it does anything from, say, Central Illinois or even Indiana.  That has to do with settlement patterns; we were on a grand water highway, much of the rest of the "Midwest" was an overland migration through the central and southern Appalachian gaps.

I've always felt that Midwest is a label that gets thrown around as a sentiment of political origin, with eastern people thinking anything west of Harrisburg is the farthest frontier still, locals in the corn belt wanting to identify as something far removed from eastern cities and immigrant populations (despite the second wave of settlement being largely of German origin itself), etc.

So you're right, we don't have a lot in common with much of the rest of the Midwest.  I also don't think we really qualify, and I usually describe the area here as Great Lakes.
I had a guy from California tell me Michigan is the east coast🫠 he said anything east of the Mississippi is east coast
I think we'd all like to believe that

In truth, it probably is

But in reality we just seek comfort that the general will not fully take over
I don't go into those stores because I find them generally more expensive than Walmart (and Chewy) for pet stuff (1 dog, 4 cats (one of whom is elderly and only eats Premium wet food) and 14 chickens). I do most of my food shopping at the local Amish discount store, Ebels, Meijer when I have bottle slips and something is on sale cheaper than Walmart, and Walmart for aspirin, ibuprofen, tums etc.
Once church per ten corn
He freely roams in California and Florida, leaving the Midwest to be dark desolate and depressing.
I accept the great lakes region.
I'm a ficking idiot, I'm from Michigan myself so I just embarrassed myself, I'll downvote my own comment
May the Ghost Ship Edmund Fitzgerald Set Down Upon Your Mansanto Crop! /S :-P
Born in Ann Arbor. Grew up in Brighton now live in royal oak. So yes Ive been to Michigan. And yes some parts of the north of Michigan are pretty. But if you live in the south east like the majority of Michigans population density then its pretty lackluster. I just moved back to be with family from the UK as they are getting very old and now I'm considering leaving. All the grim urbanism and highways is really depressing. Even all the cornfields and nothingness is depressing. Also so so so flat. The flatness I think bothers me most of all. You don't have to agree with me I just wanted to say my peace.
Very true for lower MI…take the wrong road and you can’t really be sure where IN/OH started and MI ended…
My spouse is from IN too! Another Michigan transplant 🫰🏽
>Incoming Dollar Tree/General means that they’ve identified your community as failing, which is their bread and butter.

Damn...Dollar Tree has been in Canton for over 30 years

What a ghetto.
Hey, that's jobs for 7 people, though. In total.
I live by state line too! Same in my area
Yeah you can go and get a cheap 1,000+ calorie meal at your local DG, but you can't get a bunch of bananas or a bag of potatoes. It's sustainence food, not nourishing food.
It usually means that the community has enough people relying on public transit or is too far from Walmart or Meijer to walk. That, or they are a VERY long drive from a store with better prices and selections as is the case with rural communities. Dollar Generals thrive on poverty and a lack of competition within a market. You don't see Dollar Generals near a better grocery store, unless it's a local one they're trying to choke out. 

People especially in car centric places like the US think of their community as being the whole city. For people without a vehicle, communities are much more granular. If it takes an hour and a half by bus to get to the Walmart in my city, it's not really a part of my community.
And if the items are cheaper per-unit at Walmart, and yet Dollar Generals keep popping up, what does that mean?
Chicago still has food deserts. Guarantee those dollar generals were in poor neighborhoods without local grocers or places to buy produce
And wine.

And beer.
Apparently, more than other states, and cheaper, too!
More than anyone around lol
The only other state that grows a wider variety of crops than MI is California. We are the 2nd most diverse agricultural state in the Union.
Every year I make multiple pleasure trips from Chicago to U-pick farms for a lot of those.
Dunno about that. Lives in Washington amd the east was all desert and vineyards and in the west it was basically all forests.
Ohio down to Chillicothe or Lancaster. I've spent some time this past year in Appalachia and the tri-state area and oh boy is it different.
You're forgetting Missouri which should be midwest as well.
Yes actually we do, kansan here.
I worked down in Iowa a couple years ago. Them boys did NOT consider Michigan too be Midwest.

So I said thanks
No, Indiana is in the south.
Michigan not the Midwest. Not middle, not west. Minnesota is not the Midwest either.

Edit that’s a good thing y’all. We are our own thing not some corn field. We have apples and kush.
And an Adult Store next to the biggest cross statue you've ever seen
I think it depends on where in Michigan you are.

I was born and raised in Minnesota. I moved to Michigan in my mid-20's and have lived here since 1992. The western part and northern parts are definitely culturally similar to Wisconsin and Minnesota. The southeastern part of the state is similar to western NY. To me, Michigan is a transition zone between Eastern and Midwestern cultures.
That's not true. Anything east of the Rockies is east coast.
Eventually the form corn will schism and there'll be churches for every 5
As does anyone with good sense!! 

*”Today Michigan is often called "The Great Lakes State" (nickname featured on U.S. Mint's bicentennial commemorative quarter for Michigan). Michigan is also called "Water Wonderland". **The only state that touches 4 of the 5 Great Lakes**. Michigan borders Lake Michigan, Lake Superior, Lake Huron, and Lake Erie. Lake Ontario is only Great Lake that Michigan does not touch.
Lol! I upvoted you for your funny, creative response
Try therapy
The "wrong road" is literally any road.
In cities, it's often on a neighborhood by neighborhood basis. The neighborhood with the Dollar General is almost always one which relies on a public transit system which is not particularly efficient or robust, and preys on low income residents. You're not going to find DG in East Grand Rapids, you're going to find one in Wyoming off of 28th spaced pretty equidistant from any robust grocery store. Food deserts can be more localized than just rural communities with failed industry.
my community is a small town in the mostly rural Midwest, so yeah it's car centric but it's pretty small and none of these dollar generals are really any quicker to get to than just going to Walmart by more than like a few minutes (i know my flair says Kalamazoo but that's just a more notable nearby city tbh)
And my axe.
It's around every corner (in the cities that allow it) and pretty affordable yes. It's fantastic
My friend is about to move just outside Chicago, $45 for a half gram cart when we can get 15/$100 1g carts. Homie said he’s stocking up and making the migration back whenever he’s getting dankrupt
I didn’t say all rural everywhere😉
I wasn't sure if Missouri has more in common with the Midwest, the Plains states, or the South.
Illinois native here - disagree on this one.
Yep same and never heard anything different when I was there growing up. Only when I came here suddenly I was "something else" apparently lol. Funny to hear from people who have literally never been to most of the states they're talking about.
Ask any true southerner if they claim Indiana. Lol
Uh Huh.....Suuuuuuure You Are! ;-) LOL  -  Like, say, it's -20 on Mackinac Island, and it's 0 in Indy.  South....  Suuuuuuure It Issssssz! :-P
The kush explains a lot about your comment.
Sir, you will respectfully always identify the Lion’s Den by proper name. It’s where Kings never sleep.
'Bring five corn, get into heaven' they would say
I've always liked to shop in Kentwood and maybe Walker--it was better back in the 1970's when Greenridge Country Club was still there--during the day.
I've heard that a lot of people make trips here. 

Meanwhile, a lot of other people who set up expensive medical grow operations in MI are screwed because the prices dropped so much when recreational was legalized and growing restrictions became more relaxed.
I live in Chicago and travel in to Michigan once or twice a month to see my parent. I routinely spend \~$350 bucks on marijuana for my friends and coworkers in Chicago. They can't believe how cheap it is in Michigan for the quality of product they get.
Just asked a someone from South Georgia, they looked confused and said “where?”
lol I don’t even smoke weed anymore. But I’m glad that people can without fear of the law. Still not the Midwest. We are our own thing up here in the mitten and that’s a good thing. You ever driven through Illinois? It’s like purgatory haha.
THIS COMMENT!
And they're not terrible areas, they're just car centric hell holes, and the DGs are placed strategically to be as far away from wealth and decent public transit as possible.
Supposedly we produce more than most other states do.
OK Michigan. Who won the debate?
Please keep the debate civil.
Y'all can stop flagging this post, it's not coming down no matter how many times you report it as spam.
I have a concept of who won.
The one that spoke in complete sentences.
![gif](giphy|XRKWmpN7NrJhm)
So he said 10 yrs ago that he had a plan to replace the ACA with something much better...and now ITS A CONCEPT ok that says it all
The lady who performed a post-birth abortion on a 78 year old man on national tv
“81 million people fired you” 😂😂
For what it is worth, my Boomer neighbor just took down his Trump sign.
Probably the candidate that didn’t feel it was necessary to waddle down to the press room after the debate so they could continue yelling at clouds.
The house across from me is getting a roof replaced today. At 8 am the roofers showed up and one was yelling ‘they’re eating our dogs’ and laughing. Pretty clear trump looked insane, out of touch and pathetic on the national stage. If you watch his rallies you already knew this and either love it or hate it, I think a lot of new eyes saw it last night.
It certainly wasn’t Mr. Hide Your Cats Hide Your Dogs.
Harris started off poorly by not answering a direct question, but it was easy pickings after that for her. She stayed composed, mostly answered questions in complete sentences, and successfully pointed out Trumps weaknesses while staying on topic. 

Trump appeared defensive, and even on matters playing to his supposed strengths (immigration, economy) he fumbled. Also, is he not aware that tariffs ultimately feed inflation and that consumers end up paying more?

Harris’s closing statement struck a positive tone, and she gave emotion based reasons to vote for her. Trump ended on a rant that wasn’t particularly cohesive.

From a pure “scoring the debate” perspective, Harris won handily.
Umm.... "They're eating dogs". Need I say more?
I have a concept of an opinion.
Biased, but Trump got bodied out there. It might linger too because I’ve seen a lot of “concept of a plan” memes crop up
Boomers gonna vote for a "concept" of a healthcare plan and then cry when meds costs them a chunk of their retirement
That was a dumpster fire. Idk how many times trump callled Kamala Biden. I lost count at like 56 times.
I don’t like Harris, I never have, I probably never will. Trump did a good job and convincing me that in spite of how I feel about her as a politician. I’m voting for Harris because he is not fit to be president.
She finessed him into an unhinged rant the minute she brought up the Rallys and then he gave her the added bonus about pet eating in Springfield Ohio, which I mean it's Ohio I do question them a lot, but overall she did what she had to do to win the headlines. I do realize he got fact checked live and she didn't and she did avoid answering particular questions, but his rants were 100% him.
“In Springfield, they’re eating the dogs. They’re eating the cats.” \~ Donald Trump

![gif](giphy|Y5GVgQZCluUWQ|downsized)
It was like watching a toddler debate their parent. Even if you exclude literally every horrible thing Trump has ever done, he should be in a nursing home, not running for president. It's frankly pathetic and makes me feel like the whole world is laughing at us. I look forward to his inevitable loss and a return to semi normal discourse.
Harris revealed him so expertly as the imbecile he is. Harris, easily. 
He's so emotional and easily manipulated. The contrast between the two candidates couldn't have been more clear. I'll be voting for the person with a sound mind.
I think if you’re arguing with the moderators about “I SAW IT ON TV (so it must be true).” You probably lost.
The one who didn't say "I don't have a plan. I have a concept of a plan" after running for president for almost a decade. 

😂😂😂
As a registered independent voter, I have to give it to Harris. The “they’re eating pets in Ohio because I saw it on TV” was the nail in the coffin, imo
Regardless of everything that happened during the debate, the closing statements are the thing that should really stick with people. 

Harris offered a vision of unity and hope for the future. She focused on selling herself to the American people.

Trump took that time and somehow managed to not mention a single thing he would offer the people. He focused on doom and gloom, he focused on ‘attacking the other guy’. 

This alone was the ultimate failure of the night. 

Harris laid obvious traps for trump to oafishly fall into consistently, and sure as hell, he did every time. Instead of selling himself to the people, he was playing catchup and defense the entire time… aka the hallmarks of a failed debate performance.
The one that didn’t say citizens of Springfield are eating dogs and cats en masse.
"Please keep the debate civil".
Obviously the one who didn’t say they had a concept of a plan. 

I wonder if they counted how many times he repeated numbers like millions and billions.
If trump wants to speak to racist old white dudes in a language they can comprehend then he won.

If Harris spoke to moderates and used inclusive language then she got more voters as a result of this.

Trump looked pissed off the whole time and Harris looked at Trump like lost his mind a few times.  Trump would not look at her at all.  A sign of weakness.
It was a night of Kamala throwing sticks and Trump playing fetch. She won this, hands down. Norma Desmond had his close-up...and was still out this morning bragging about how he "won" the debate. That lack of self-awareness alone should disqualify him.
I think people saw what they wanted to see. Like, I texted my grandparents and my grandmother said that she thought the American people lost, and she still thought Donald Trump would be better at running the country because he was better on the economy and our country looked more respectable on the international stage with him in charge. 
  
I have no idea wtf she’s talking about bc Trump looked like a weak, pathetic, over-emotional, idiot out there and Harris was right that he was just some loser that is “friends with someone known to be a dictator that would EAT HIM FOR LUNCH.”
not lil’ orange
This is the only debate I think Trump would have done better if he HAD backed out.
Harris. Send Trump to prison on his 43 felony counts.

Downvote all you want. Let the rule of law rule!
TKO Harris over Trump in the 15th round. Unanimous decision on all the scorecards otherwise except for the Russian judge.
So with him it's all about grievance,  no one can solve things but him (ya, right) and he'll have an answer in two weeks.  Oh, and he's the only leader on the world stage to have saluted N Korea's dictator and say he believes Putin over his own Intel community.  Check, got it.  Loser.
The moment Harris said people were leaving his rallies early it was a wrap. He completely went off the rails after that. Her objective was to get under his skin and get him on tangents and she succeeded.
The answer is most likely Harris, but it's awfully convenient Trump is using the "nasty immigrant swarm" as his main platform, because guess what his built-in excuse is going to be when he loses: voter fraud by illegals.  He thinks he's playing chess.
Trump is catering to the elderly and cognitively declined people. After so many people made fun of Biden for having dementia. Trump isn't far behind. I think she won.
I’m Harris 100% but I really don’t like fracking. I’m sure she’s supporting it to please someone cos it’s definitely really bad for the environment by contaminating clean ground water. People who rely on well water say it totally contaminates their drinking water and methane gas escapes through the plumbing and they can literally make flames shoot out while the water is on and ignited.
Trump repeated himsef so much that the moderator told him that the arguments he kept bringing up were already adressed. Easy to think I accidentally rewound from what he repeated.
That and the fact that he mentioned fake news about cats and dogs makes him loose the debate so Harris wins
,la
Harris. 1000%
I’ve gotten so tired of how Trump speaks.
Generalizations and narcissistic references all day long.
The one who initiated a handshake before it even started. Ya know, like the good ol days of civilized, intelligent presidential debates.
The cats and dogs line ain’t going anywhere 😂
“THEYRE GIVING ALIENS TRANSGENDER OPERATIONS IN PRISON!!”
 
And Howard Dean was ran out of town for getting excited. Imagine if he just yelled that at random.
I'm just glad I live in Michigan, my pets are safe.
Harris by a million miles.  Trump is an angry buffoon that has no plans to forward this country.  His only vice is hate.
......and yet when interviewed this morning many Michiganders used the fear of illegal immigrants (brown people) as a justification to vote for Trump. They don't care how crazy he is, he's a white guy.

Nothing ever changes. Privilege vrs common good just like some Downton Abby crap.
When grandpa comes to dinner and you have to overlook all the crazy and racial stuff he says.
Probably not the guy debating with the fact checkers about Haitian immigrants eating dogs

His source was literally "I saw it on TV bro". Real old man energy
I need JA Rule. Where is Ja
Advisors: OK, sir, let’s try to remember to appear calm, cool, rational, Presidential

Trump: **THE PEOPLE WHO CAME, THEY’RE EATING THE PETS OF THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE**
The one that was not a convicted felon
A brick wall would have won that debate against Trump.
Pet eating immigrants is definitely my number one priority!
"Concepts of a plan" pretty much sums up everything. Trump has no idea what he's doing- no plan for anything. No platform. All he can do is make up shit about immigrants and lie out his ass.
I've watched many debates in which people failed to put that bloviating orange sack of shit on defense.
Kamala succeeded where no one else had, without allowing herself to be intimidated in the least.

Commander in chief test? Check. 
Taylor Swift level unlocked? Check.
Orange boil lanced? We'll see.
Kamala.

She showed trump as an easily manipulated man, with no plans.

She baited him and he fell for it constantly. Also showed he believes everything he sees on fox.
I just finished watching it. She did a great job speaking directly to the electorate about what she would do. He was on defense all night and showed he has no plan. He can’t remember saying things he has said or makes excuses. He is exactly as he appears, an unqualified candidate. She, on the other hand appears very capable and this choice is now clear.
I love that Trump brought up the Student Loan relief when HIS FUCKING PEOPLE KEPT BLOCKING IT. Of course ti didn't pass you stacked the Supreme Court with Corrupt paid for people.
Just by the contrast: Kamala made him look quite insane.
Harris won. I wish they would have gone a little deeper on the elector scheme when they brought up Jan 6. That would have sunk him completely. However, Harris pivoted rather then doubling down. That would have been a kill shot. Trump came off as unhinged with the illegals eating your pets BS. Just goes to show how easily he can be tricked.
Debate summary for those that missed it:

DJT: I haven't discussed this with J.D. Vance but I saw on TV that school teachers (nasty women, mostly) are going into our prisons, sometimes to execute seven day old trans-gender alien babies before they eat Fido and Fifi and sometimes to give them abortions. The only way to stop them is tariffs!

KDH: Weird.

End of summary.
"Trump said he saw it on the teevee so it must be true!"
VP Harris for the win!
Vote!💙 Vote!💙 Vote!💙
Trump couldn’t even remember the name of the Keystone (he called it excel) pipeline. I’ll take the one not in cognitive decline.
Trump was asked if he had any regrets regarding Jan 6th. I don’t remember his answer except it was a bunch of word salad bullshit. He truly takes the cake for being the top narcissist in the world.
Not the one that hangs out in underage girls dressing rooms
Idk how you can walk away from that and think trumps the man. I mean transgender illegals are eating our dogs and cats. Like come on man.
Harris
Harris by a landslide
It was a bloodbath. The victim was left stained orange.
Donald faced three opponents during the debate: Harris, Reality, and the Truth & he couldn't recognize at least two of the three.
We all won being able to watch that entertaining shit show
Kamala Devi Harris, aka Chef Momma La cause she cooked his ass!
We witnessed elder abuse last night and it was so entertaining! Kamala Harris beat that man into a pulp.
Trump spent his time warning of a zombie apocalypse.
I can’t believe he actually tried to spew the cats and dogs shit. It’d be so funny if it wasn’t so sad
Not 1 thing from trump said to me he is not in this race for anything but his own agenda - how do you not have one policy he could have explained? Nothing however everything is wrong done this that all wrong and he can do better. Knows everything more than anyone, every leader from around the world calls him often and tells him everything. Really - I can show you video of 30 plus of them laughing at him behind his back and its not an isolated incedent. 
 A dark cloud that stays put and doesn't move on. Belittling every person that he has no use for or more like they have no use for him. . Sad way to live a life. 
 Watch the poll numbers mid week next week. He will lose his mind.
Immigrants eating pets, after birth executions or whatever he said lol, is providing immigrants with transgender surgeries… I mean??? Why say these things
I'll be honest:  I didn't watch it.  I had already made up my mind as to who I'm voting for on January 6th, 2021.
I think Harris easily shows how Trump can be easily manipulated by the bait he consistently fell for. Harris won the debate.
Same old same old with him, "millions of people", "everyone", "nobody" nebulous statements.  Kamala certainly got under his skin.  I wish she had looked more at the cameras than at him.  News I’ve seen indicates that she won.  Either way, she has my vote.
Trumps super power is flooding the zone with so much bullshit it’s almost impossible to have a debate. I don’t think this swayed any voters but the memes from it have been 10/10.
I watched and saw aw a Woman who knows who she is and what she stands for period. I'm Neither Rep or Dem  but at least rational enough to see and hear that this Woman is definitely Ready and going to be the next President of the United States of America.
The one who had a coherent thought process and spoke in complete sentences without being on the brink of crying.
I am waiting for the 'cat-sup' memes
Not even close...donOLD showed the whole world what an incompetent, uneducated, unserious candidate he really is
Kamala hands down! Trump was big angry that he got fact checked on his immigrants eating pets schtick 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
When he started talking about pets...
He wandered around the spin room after the debate desperately trying to convince people there that he had won. It is pretty obvious that even Trump thinks he got destroyed during that debate.
Seriously, Trump is so dumb, he can be triggered so easily, and some people want this guy negotiating with hostile foreign leaders.
The one who wasn’t accusing immigrants of eating your pets.
From eating pets to she puts out to transgender surgery on illegal immigrate in jail.. I guess I’d go with Kamala by a whisker
Harris, by TKO
She ate him for dinner
Springfield Ohio - I guess you can wok your dog there.
Harris dog walked him
I mean, at this point I have to assume that he is a Democratic plant trying to implode the Republican party.
She played him like a fiddle. I’m not surprised she was able to so easily manipulate him.
Racism. In 1524 there were crazy stories of Jewish people eating Christian babies. In 2024 we have crazy stories of Haitians eating dogs and cats. tRump is drawing on a deep well of racism.
Definitely not the guy who unironically said "they're giving transgender surgeries to illegal aliens in jail"
It’s very clear who won. The one who answered questions when asked and presented themselves in a respectful manner. A level headed, smart woman she is!
He lost his mind when she mentioned his rallies. Something a composed leader would have just brushed off. The man is unfit for office
Harris
Harris. It wasn’t close, she’s the leader we need.
Anyone that think trump won needs their head examined.....
Kamala curb stomped him. It wasn’t even close.
One thing trump said that I agree with was that Putin would be sitting in Moscow a lot happier if he was president
One lost his last ounce of credibility when he yelled THEIR EATING THEIR PETS.🤣🤣🤣🤣What a moron. It’s not even a close call.
Pumpkin cheeks got clapped
Mango Mussolini got dog walked
I thought it was so obvious who won, but then I saw the thousands of twitter comments talking about her cheating and how trump won...like what the hell is wrong with these people? Either Russian bots or maga is truly the dumbest mother fuckers we've ever seen in this society
Harris 10,000%
not the bigot orange turd
I wish Trump got fact checked in real time more often. Maybe little bubbles that appear on screen like Pop Up Video.
Harris won, Trump flunked.
Neither and we’re all so so so fucked.
The one that doesn’t want to mass murder trans individuals like myself. So Harris.
Am I missing something? Not going to comment on who won, but isn’t it strange there isn’t a single trump supporter on this forum? I get Reddit skews democrat but I didn’t expect a 99% to ~<1% split in the comments…
It’s sad.. everyone on here, having tunnel vision.. the modern day Crips and bloods, red versus blue..
If you’re happy currently with the way the United States, then vote for Harris.. Please pray to God you didn’t make the wrong choice like you did with Biden..  The Democrats are doing a standup job, eh.. Open borders, inflation, housing markets, two wars going on, withdrawal from Afghanistan, billions of our tax dollars & half of it is not a counter for, for those wars, (we just armed al-Qaeda good job, (brothers and sisters died for nothing) on top of paying Afghanistan $40 million a week. Look it up, Afghanistan is Al-Qaeda.. 
we are the laughing stock around the world, not the world power, open your eyes people.. I’m speaking as a veteran and 99.9% for veterans we’re voting for Trump.. do the research and see what he did for us not what the news Tells you.. 
if you know people overseas, have a conversation..
There is a war coming. It already started here.. 
Art of war, Sun Tzu- create chaos within.. look at what’s going on right now!!! friends are not friends, family turns their back on family because of blue vs red.. on here everybody sounds like sheep, even Harris..
Kamala Harris won the debate.
The one who is able to conjugate correctly, with proper grammar, and is willing to fight to restore rights throughout the United States of America. God Bless Kamala Harris and God Bless America.
I think Cats were the clear winners.
"I have concepts of plans."

After 9 years of Republicans saying they are going to repeal and replace Obamacare (one of the most popular government programs in the country), they still have no plan.

Trump refused to say he would veto a national abortion ban.

Trump refused to say he supports Ukraine.

On those points alone, he lost.
Harris seemed coherent and well spoken, Trump was a mess, so he played to his base… you know… weirdos
The blatant way Harris was able to manipulate Trump into going off on tangents and getting angry should be a huge indicator that the man cannot be trusted to deal with other governments. If she can do that in front of the whole country, what’s going to happen behind closed doors with less than honorable world leaders?
Harris, hands down.  She mopped the floor with him.  He continues to show he has no plan, no policy, and only wants to run on hate, fear, anger and division.
Donvict spent the entire debate confused and histrionic. It was borderline elder abuse lol.
America won. Everyone got to see what he really cares about, and as a result everyone now gets to confirm what they already knew.

The Republican party has lost all standing and moral authority. There is no single justification you could have to genuinely and seriously defend that person and their actions as president.

He is paranoid, delusional, offers no real platform asside from a facist ideology and a well known and touted philosophy that is the tyranical mission of MAGA and it's project 2025 play book. Voting for the republican party is genuinely a room tempature IQ move in the upcoming election.
A concept of a plan to figure out who won.
We'll let you know in 2 weeks.
What do you want from me?? It’s infrastructure week!
I mean I thought Trump made some really solid points about the dog buffet
Seriously. There isn’t even a question. Harris wiped the floor with Trump. He looked old, tired and defeated because he is literally all of those things. She was amazing. She has my vote, hands down.
How dare you insult the political reality of people who just heard about that yesterday, have never seen anything to support the claim, and will do nothing to investigate it any further.

It's just as real to them as you and I are. Maybe more. Here's video evidence. This cat is a sandwich. HE'S DOOMED!

Were we watching the same debate?? He *clearly* said “something cheaper and with better coverage”! Duh! Chexmix, Libulardo!

/s…in case it wasn’t obvious 😜
“EXECUTE”
Got a clip of it?
Found one: https://youtu.be/eSyLbCb8FMo?si=KbnBpF3LkSC9sotS
Did you see his reaction to that, it was GOLD Jerry.
He clearly has zero understanding about how elections work. “I was told if I got 63 million votes, I’d win. I got more than that, how did I lose?”

Because Biden got BIGGLIER numbers. Your people didn’t factor in that there would be a lot more people voting than before. So, yes, it might have been true at one point. But they were wrong.
Loved that line
I feel like this was a missed opportunity to say "81 million people told you, you're fired"

Good for him.
That is amazing. I hope it is true.
Somewhere in the world a beautiful rainbow appears every time a Trump sign comes down 😂
It’s a signal of Fox’s power that most of my (former) fellow republicans were today years old when they FINALLY figured out that trump is just a stupid loser. I warned everyone in 2016.
A small win is a win indeed
This is the news I'm here for
![gif](giphy|fqtyYcXoDV0X6ss8Mf)
I seen dumbass right wingers calling Harris a coward for not showing up to press room afterwards. they either don’t know or don’t care about truth to say candidates don’t go there after debates. It’s their campaign people who are there.
Couple this with the recent indictment of the right wing vloggers being paid by Russia Russia Russia and I think more are waking up to the possibility that they were bamboozled by a New York City conman
Knowing roofers, if they're making fun of a republican then it's over lol
I'm an apprentice currently going to class and that's literally the first thing that got brought up today. Even the guys who didn't watch last night were laughing at how stupid it was. 

Lots of South Park "tey took arr jarbs an now arr dargs!"
I hope undecided voters feel the same way! His nutbag cult followers will follow him to the grave if they had to.

I was happy he brought that up because it has been (obviously) debunked and sounds batshit crazy, until I logged into Facebook this morning and saw dozens of Trumpers repeating it and believing it because "Trump said so..."    

Un-freaking-believable, these people are in some sort of weird hypnotized trance.
They eatin everybody out here!
Dying
I appreciate I was not the only one that could not seperate that from this meme lol
In every single presidential debate I’ve ever watched, no matter what the first question actually is, the candidates without fail respond as if the moderator said “please give your opening statement”

It’s annoying, but it is what it is, and I’m not going to mark either of them down for it.
I think he thinks that tariffs go straight to the US government and more money = good, the fact that it will negatively impact the citizens of said country is inconsequential to him. He's probably thinking of it like a business where more profit = good, fuck the workers, they're replaceable. Except the analogy doesn't track when you're talking about an entire country. 

And also that's giving him entirely too much credit.
The reasoning was because he can’t mentally bully someone sharper than him. He never straight answers questions, it’s a response followed with a deflection, followed with something irrelevant. He couldn’t play bully ball like he did with Clinton and Biden. 

And speaking of inflation, I wish people would stop confusing inflation with price gouging and corporate greed. Companies recording record profits doesn’t sound like their costs are going up.
Considering he didn't seem to know what IVF was until last night (remember how he was going to make sure insurance paid for all Americans to undergo IVF?) when he pointedly explained what it was (he's all about projection), I'm not sure he does understand tariffs and isn't just parroting talking points his wealthy buddies gave him
She seemed a little nervous at first, then about 15 minutes in she got her footing and held tight.
He legit brought every question back to “BUT THE IMMIGRANTS” even though the questions had nothing to do with immigration and it was pathetic and it made him look like a senile old man yelling at clouds
On r/conservative they were all saying his closing statement was really great and the best part. Maybe they just like the crazy rants.
And aborting babies after birth!
And they are killing babies after they are born. 🙄 What an idiot. That’s just straight up murder. No one is doing that. He is just a tired idiot. If you are still supporting this man, you are in a cult. Plain and simple. No rational person would support the ramblings of this deranged lunatic.
just so I got this right.... he falsely accused Haitian immigrants of eating people's pets but wants RFK, jr to be in his cabinet?
This is my #1 concern these days!!!!
My favorite so far is the work memes "Boss: Do you have a plan you can send over Me: I have a concept of a plan"
We’ve got “concept of a plan”, “eating dogs”, “transgender surgery on illegal aliens in prison”, and “people from insane asylums taking black and Hispanic jobs”.  

Did I miss any?
Don't forget Alf eating a cat.
He had 4 years to concept lol. All we got was a bunch of nothing.
Yeah, we took that off the drinking card fast.
I liked it, “who’s actually running the country right now!? -2 min later- SHES BIDEN.” Oh so you do know the line of succession and the safe guards of our democracy!! I’m so proud of your high school civics lessons coming thru!
He called David Muir, Dan.
I wish more people would realize you don't have to like someone to vote for them. I dislike politicians in general but that doesn't keep me from voting.
Good to hear that. Hopefully you can convince more trumpers that voting for Harris is what’s best for everyone.
Right? Regardless of how you feel about Harris it's become so abundantly clear that Trump is a senile old man who just rambles about what he saw on television as if it's fact and only really cares about his easily bruised ego.

Someone like that shouldn't be running the country, no matter what your politics are.
This really is the only sensible opinion to have for the loyal Republicans and Moderates. The nation needs a responsible, competent, and coherent person in one of the most powerful positions in the world. They need to be the best of us, weather the execution of policy may differentiate and have give and take, you need to be able to walk across the aisle, shake their hand and unify, and serve the people who appointed you.

I did not hear anything unifying, even in his conspiracy if it were true that people are eating cats and dogs, he would rather victimize, blame and make fun than deliver genuine policy and discussion on how to fix it.
It's almost like there is not a choice.
Just vote for Harris this one time, let Trump and MAGA fade in to oblivion and then vote for whoever you want next election.
If anyone's eating kittens and puppies in Ohio, you can be sure it's the people *from* Ohio.
Yep. She dodged a few questions that would be very difficult to explain and get a point across within a two minute window.

The kind of questions that get you trapped in the weeds that, even if you fully and correctly answer the question, you still “lose”.

I do wish the moderators had pointed out, “That’s not how tariffs work.” When he first started ranting about tariffs.

He really doesn’t know how tariffs work. He has no idea what tariffs are even used for in our modern times, which is almost exclusively used to combat “dumping” on a very thin segment of products and or to help domestic production ramp up, especially in products that we have collectively been caught with our pants down, simply ignoring.

Like the current tariffs on Solar Panels and Batteries for EVs and other applications.
I mean, she dodged, which is to be expected in presidential debates. 

Outright brazen lies deserve to be fact checked live.
The reason Trump got fact checked live more is because he lied more lol
Is it that he got fact checked more because the moderators were biased or because he was a straight up geyer of delusional bullshit and lies and therefore had to be fact-checked more?

(It's the latter)
Fact checking is easy when you flat-out *LIE.*

& he lied to the American people.

Don't get me started on the 'Millions killed' in Ukraine....no wonder he's such an awful businessman...can't count.
That whole story about pet eating likely came from a different case that did happen in Ohio. It was just Canton, Ohio 190 miles northeast of Springfield. 

[Allexis T. Ferrell](https://www.cantonrep.com/story/news/politics/2024/09/10/canton-woman-accused-of-eating-cat-not-haitian-from-springfield-ohio/75157976007/) is charged with cruelty to companion animals, a fifth-degree felony. It is alleged she killed the cat by stomping on its head before eating it. She’s not Haitian but is black, so that is probably what confused the racists.
If she can coax him into admitting he works for Russia that would be amazing
So that’s what happened to Snowball 1 thru 4…
Lol, so I looked it up and someone did kill and eat a cat publicly in Ohio in 2015. From the ap news


 'On Aug. 26, Canton police charged a 27-year-old woman with animal cruelty and disorderly conduct after she “did torture, kill, and eat a cat in a residential area in front (of) multiple people,” according to a police report.


She is a local resident who has a history of breaking laws. So, proof that Ohioans are crazy, cat eaters. 😺 🍴 
It is NOT inevitable. Not even close. Everyone must register and vote!
The fact he still denies the 2020 election tells you all you know. It’s been four years 0 evidence of mass voter fraud yet he still won’t concede. His OWN handpicked election lawyers went before republican judges some even Trump appointed and lost their case. Now these lawyers have been indicted for conspiracy and have PLEAD GUILTY. 

It’s embarrassing he’s even on the stage. Jan 6 should of been enough
I saw only a portion, i plan on streaming it at work today. My god, she baited him so bad, he didn't even realize it. The topic of climate change, he wasn't even in the same ballpark. He just had to respond to the poisoned bait.


I loved how she kept reiterating she wasn't Biden and trump wasn't debating Biden!

I would say hopefully this is the end of trump. But sadly I believe his cultists have already drank the Kool-Aid and are with him until death. I'm convinced he could literally waddle out of his limo in the middle of times square or even the capital, and just start shooting and throwing grenades. Becoming the next mass murderer. His cultists would still follow him.


Edit: a word
Not very difficult to reveal. He did that extremely well on his own
She had her routine figured out perfectly tbh.

1. Answer the question (at least a little bit) to show people her policies
2. Throw out some bait for Trump to latch onto and completely ignore the question he got asked.

It was particularly obvious when she mentioned his rallies and it was all downhill for him from there.
What a bumbling fucking idiot
It was all downhill for him after that. Kamala's debate coaches really earned their salaries - she knew *exactly* what she was doing.
That’s all it took?  You were still with him up to then?
Even Drudge Report called that the moment Trump lost the election
Registered independent voter where? Michigan voters don’t register party affiliation.
Uh, boss, I have a concept of a plan.
I saw that and went "Oh my god he's a Facebook mom"
For me the fact that he refused to look in her direction said everything anyone should need to know. Very cowardly posture.
Not quite seeing what they wanted to see, but definitely some ignoring reality.  I've seen very few people claiming Trump won, so even his supporters aren't going that far.  But there's a lot of "America lost" or "we all lost" or "nobody won" going around.  If they were seeing purely what they wanted to see, there'd be a lot less of that and a lot more of "Trump won".

Trump got bodied, but it's not because he had a particularly bad debate or Harris had a particularly great debate.  An average debate from both of them results in Trump losing because he is a rarely coherent narcissist.
His numbers don’t move so he has nothing to gain. It was only Kamala who could benefit. She did great and Swift immediately endorsed her after. 

Also, people are focusing a lot on Trumps craziness but I hope we see more attention on how much Kamala bodied him. 

> your love letters to Kim Jung Un

> you adore strongmen

> a perceived friendship with a dictator who would eat you for lunch

Goddamn
Isn't it 39?
Didn't you hear him, they force people to undergo gender reassignment surgery in prison!!
[removed]
Harris acted like a presidential contender. Trump went to his usual game of rambling BS. He couldn’t or wouldn’t defend anything other than his admiration of dictators. I call it a KO in favor of Harris.
I actually commend her for holding it together the way she did. 

I burst out laughing several times at his completely outrageous and immediately debunked claims, but she just smiled, shook her head, or looked at him with a pitying  "Oh...bless your heart, hun" expression.

"Post birth abortions." So, like, straight up murder? 😆

"Immigrants in Ohio eating dogs and cats", and then *he doubled down* after embarrassingly getting fact checked on the spot!

After *9 years* of trying to come up with something better than Obama Care, he has "A concept of a plan". Well, if *that* doesn't fill you with confidence!

I truly enjoyed watching Harris slowly unravel him. She went for his biggest insecurity and hit the exposed nerve when she said "people leave his rallies early because they are bored". 

You know that's when his brain hit the blue screen and he was unable to recover from that blow. He was *so* mad! 😆
Harris is a genuinely good person. I read “The truths we hold” by her. The way she spoke confirmed her principles laid out in the book. She’s honest, empathetic and sincere. I want her to win.
I chortled
15th?  1st....
What troubles me is how he is so “Us vs. Them” and insults all immigrants. If we aren’t Native American Tribe, we are all immigrants from our ancestors.
Motherfucker probably can’t even spell chess.
Gotta win Pennsylvania unfortunately
It's an electoral college thing.  It's popular in PA and PA is maybe the most important electoral college state this election.
I don’t like fracking either but compromise is a necessary part of leadership. She’s about to be running a country of 330 million people. You’re not gonna like every policy
Yep. We need to end fracking and start building SMR Nuclear reactors en masse, and start scooting more people onto electric baseboard heating and similar, to minimize, eliminate the need for burning fossil fuels and thus negate needing to frack.

SMR Reactors are newer designs, extremely safe, and very efficient. Some of them can utilize existing reprocessed nuclear waste as well, making them a good candidate for eliminating existing nuclear waste stock piles.
We border ohio AND canuckistan.  Those illegal immigrants from Canada are going to eat our moose.
Yeah, God knows what I’d do if I lived in Springfield. 

Probably eating my cats
Listen, he's got a concept of a plan. That's enough. He'll fuckin do it live!
Northern Michigan here. I can’t believe how many Harris Waltz yard signs have went up. It’s definitely a change from 2020.
whatwouldibewithoutmybaby??
This is my favorite part of last night. There are so many people that "don't follow politics" (like my sister) that had no idea what half of his crazy talking points, the ones all getting laughed at today, were even about. She kept asking in our family group chat "the what?" Nobody outside of the right wing bubble really pays attention to all these crazy stories coming from them except a portion of people on the left that just sit here shaking our heads and laughing. Her invite for undecided voters to go to one of his rallies was spot on because a lot of what he spews to his base would really turn off a lot of people that might not have been paying attention. Instead, he gave everyone watching a free preview of a rally. I really doubt his rants pulled any new voters to his side last night
I know! She was an intelligent functioning adult, and he was a raving lunatic old man. As I've always said, I wouldn't put him in charge of a garage sale let alone the country.
She aborted a 70-something year old baby right on stage.
Dementia.
With your Holland flair I’m really unsure which way you meant there.
That’s better than Poodle meat I’d imagine. Have to ask the people from Ohio I guess
And I’ll reveal it, in the not too distant future
A concept of a plan to conceive a solution to answer who won?
I've got a Theory for a concept for a plan to figure out who won
I couldn't believe it....I kept thinking "is this guy going to Star-Lord his way through a presidency?"
That and his "concepts of a plan" that he needs to be in the Whitehouse to do? Idk that doesn't pass the sniff test.
You mean the baseless claim that immigrants are eating animals, which isn't even true? That?
Even though it was one case of a non-immigrant crazy woman 3 hours from where he said it took place. He just said Springfield so he could villainize Haitian people with no actual basis.
But Victor Orban LOVES him and told him

 "Donnie you are the greatest president in the history of the USA"

So there's that
She dog walked that dude. Baited the hell outta him and he took every bite.
Watching her verbally dissect him and his nonsense was glorious! Could he have been more pissed off about her comment about people leaving his rallies because he's boring? He was done after that!
The entire debate his body language and tone was pure anger and disgust. She stood up straight, smiled and spoke to the nation. This is both of their approaches to a T.
I actually am worried about Harris after the debate. It looks like there is a pretty much open and shut case against her for elder abuse.
According to my co-worker there was not a clear cut winner and it's up in the air...

I'm not sure we watched the same debate.
Dear Jesus. I didn’t watch the debate but even that clip of him responding makes me want to walk into traffic
He is not capable of dealing with a Real Adult
I don’t think touting a compliment from *Viktor Orban* is the flex he thinks it is.
Jesus H.

This clip begins with an articulate, accurate response followed by a disastrous word salad weave, the likes of which are unfortunately too common. It is a three-minute summary of the debate and why the wheels are falling off the GOP short bus.
He got BIG MAD after that one lol
ok thats a CLAP BACK if I ever heard one lmao
Do you have any cookie cutters shaped like dogs and cats?
Coconut cookies?
An NPR article pointed out that the only time candidates immediately go to the press room is if it was a primary debate with a lot of participants and one feels they weren’t given enough time to talk or that they *did badly* and are trying to do damage control.
Honestly, If she had, it would have instantly and completely deflated Don. She would have taken all the limelight and cameras right away from him. It would have been kinda masterful. Plus he was just there to stroke his own narcissistic ego, after not having a crowd to feed on earlier.
Yep, massive sign of weakness to head into the spin room with your pathetic tail/mushroom between your legs.
The vloggers haven't been indicted. The people paying them have, but not the vloggers themselves. It's perfectly legal to accept money from Russian agents and spew Russian propaganda. What was illegal was the financiers using shell corps and fake identities to pay the personalities without having to declare themselves as agents of a foreign government.
Yeah, I'm baffled as to why republicans keep talking about the "Russia, Russia, Russia Hoax" when it becomes increasingly clear that Russia is all over the Republican Party. Weird that they would want to remind us.
not being facetious, do you have a source for the russia-paid vloggers?
**ALF!**
There's no way that cat isn't severely sedated or dead, lol
This meme should be [reimagined](https://imgflip.com/i/934t4r).
The absolute craziest thing to me is that at some point during their debate prep, the moderators had to have a conversation about how they would react it if the former president brought up message board rumors of immigrants eating cats and dogs.

Why the fuck, in the United States, is "Hey one candidate might bring up these random right wing messages board rumors, we should be ready to fact check that" a thing that people can easily anticipate?
Immediately after the debate, folks on r/Trump were still insisting that immigrants are eating pond ducks. At least r/conservative seemed to know he was full of shit on that issue..

On the other hand, r/conservative was coping hard with the Taylor Swift endorsement. Many comments along the lines of, "who cares?" All I could think was, your cult leader who posted a FAKE Taylor Swift endorsement a couple of weeks ago.

Over on r/Trump, I saw so many comments along the lines of, "they fact checked Trump but didn't fact check Harris!"

Now, a normal, non-brainwashed person would likely conclude that she wasn't fact checked because she wasn't lying.

But to the cult, the idea that she wasn't lying is unthinkable. They won't even consider it. They're so used to being lied to, that it's their default assumption.
The simple answer is that these people are racists and are willing to believe this because it makes them feel superior to immigrants.  I'm an immigrant from Asia and have definitely heard these stereotypes leveled against me as a child.
I have lifelong ties to Haiti and I literally cried I was so angry when I saw this misinformation go viral on Monday. I want to laugh that he brought it up, but I have friends (some I’d consider family) that are being directly impacted by this. 

(I don’t mind that people are laughing. I’m just not ready to yet.)
Maybe we should just start with that and then ask actual questions.
He knows they don't.  He just wants his cult to believe they do.
It’s revealing him as politically ignorant/illiterate - which more people should absolutely see him as. The old fool.
100% she was nervous at first, then she settled in and cooked his ass
Don't forget the "transgender surgeries on illegal immigrants in prisons."
Well, we just saw an 800 month baby be aborted on live television so.
“Yeah we do have “after birth” executions they’re called school shootings” - March For Our Lives
Remember when he got called out for that being a lie, and he said it again anyways.
After just talking to some co-workers about it, almost all of whom are GOP supporters if not outright into MAGA everything, I have to say, they are truly in a cult.  They brought up Trump calling it murder, and when the abortion talk gets stale for them they switch the topic saying that "if she wins, we are all in the poor house".  One of them blamed Obama for everything (still) and said that he was due to retire in 2009 but couldn't do it because of "Obama crashing the economy like Biden just did".  In the odd moments where I could get them to admit something Trump said was not true, they would just backpedal and say that "well they both sounded like school kids fighting on the playground".

Many people hear what they want to hear and blame who they want to blame, and last night changed nothing for many, at least those who are already decided in their vote.
I didn't have "roadkill" on my 2024 Election bingo card, and that was a big miss.
That’s a sterling archer line right there
Okay this is the second time he's brought up transgender surgery. A week ago he was doing an interview and said schools were performing transgender surgeries and teachers were like "we have that budget?"
He’s literally just your old racist uncle parroting misinformation he saw on Facebook. Embarrassing that this is what one of our main political parties is trotting out.
He's been talking about his non-existent health care plan for nearly a decade. He's a do-nothing ignoramus who loves getting praise from dictators and is literally running so he isn't put in jail.
I’m just glad to know that Harris supports fracking on illegal Pennsylvanians in prison and transgender operations on intergalactic aliens.
Executing babies after they’re born
Babies killed after birth 🤪
“She’s not black and puts out”
Xenomorph fans getting so many memes already.
“I saw it on television”
Tariffs are paid by other nations, not us. But no, the costs and billions upon billions collected never touches American pockets…

That’s an insane point too.
Victor Orban is a great authoritarian.  He should help decide our election.  Hungary is better at deciding.   Let's let Hungary vote for us.  They will do it peacefully and patriotically.
He does kinda look like Alf.
Actually.... [we got a huge book of blank paper](https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewsolender/2020/10/21/trump-presented-cbs-with-book-on-his-health-care-record--opened-to-a-blank-page/)
9 years, Dude. 9 years
Really he's had like 9 years, all his "great people" have been working on "finding a replacement" to the ACA since he was campaigning in 2015-2016.
I liked when he said that she doesn’t even know Biden and insinuated that she’s never even met the guy. Like ???
I never liked anyone I voted for except Obama the 2nd time.
With project 2025 in the hands of someone who isn't fit to be president... Yeah.
Ohio State grads gotta eat.
Vance needs a snack after a hard day on the couch.
It could just be RFK Jr. Was he in Springfield recently?
This whole bs got started because a woman from Ohio ate a cat. Clearly suffering some mental issues. 

https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/08/22/ohio-woman-ate-cat/74902749007/
I laughed way too hard at this 😂😂
I also wish someone would ask him the difference between asylums for the mentally ill and seeking political asylum as a refugee. 

Based on his rambling speeches and press conferences, I am pretty sure he does not understand the difference between the two uses of the word.  It would explain why he almost always talks about Hanibal Lector, in the context of immigration: because he thinks the character,  who was in an asylum,  was there "seeking asylum. " 

Or maybe I am just trying too hard to plot the mind wanders of a madman.
I still don't understand how he thinks raising tariffs is going to bring down costs. Like maybe eventually if it spurs enough domestic production, but raising tariffs so high, a percentage is gonna end up costing the consumers more.  Also the way manufacturing works, I feel like the manufacturer s just raise their prices because there's less competition until a certain price point.
Some of those lies were so insane even people watching had to fact check 😂
Didn’t watch what types of questions didn’t she want to answer?
And they still kept letting him get the last word in
And somehow they knew he was going to rant about something insane and had the real info ready.
The part where she said he loves dictators then said he was friends with Putin because that’s a positive to him
I like the underlying subtext- if it was this easy for me to rile him up, how is he actually an effective leader?
Yep. He is a cult of personality.
He did the same thing against Biden, except the media chose to focus on Biden seeming too old rather than Trump being as crazy as ever.
She baited him so well, when she talked about his crowd sized he couldn't take it.
As soon as she mentioned the rally size his eyes crossed. Too funny. She baited him hook line and sinker. It was beautiful.
> You were still with him up to then?

No. Hence being independent
when he was in office, he said 'I have a plan. It will be released in two weeks'. Dems should find the date of that quote and count the weeks since he said it. Then tell us it's been 416 weeks... where is it?
Because he is at heart a coward
And don't forget get praising Viktor Orban
If he can't handle a few pointed (and let's face it, not entirely inaccurate) jabs, he's not fit for President.
It’s 34, but his list of crimes is endless. Let’s be honest.
I’m too tired to keep count. 😔
And in schools!  They do the surgery right at school and little Johnny comes home as Jane and the parents don't know until it's too late!!
I honestly don't know how anyone who has heard him speak in the last 8 years could even consider voting for him.
That's the entire point. America is literally a nation of immigrants. "Give me your tired, your poor"
Us vs them is a fascist trope. A dog whistle to the fear center of the brain. Just like immigrants eating your dogs and killing babies after birth. How could any decent American be for that? Ties it to democrats as the perpetrators. It’s how it works. He counts on the people who are scared of everything unfamiliar to them to react.
I visited a friend at his place on a lake in PA.  Holy ####, there are a lot of trumpers there.   Many with signs.  One depicting him as Captain America.  I really wish this debate had happened before I visited as I'm curious if the signs,  hats, shirts,  flags, bumper stickers,  etc. remain.  Sadly, I'm guessing yes.   Very scary.
It has also single-handedly led to us out producing both Russia and OPEC in crude oil the last 3 years in a row. I volunteer for the NPS, am a nature lover, and despise fracking; but I recognize that it is a key thing for voters in a large swing state and it's allowed gas prices to lower significantly, I'll accept it begrudgingly for now.
>electric baseboard heating

How about heat-pump mini-splits
Those meese (fixed that for you) illegally immigrated south to the US from Canada in the first place so they were never yours. Send them back and we’ll deal with their insolence.
“Concept of a plan” lol he’s saying “I’ve heard the term ‘plan’ before and many people are saying I know what it means”
If you put him in charge of a garage sale, he'd sell everything at half price, and pocket everything but $3, then blame you for not having stuff worth selling.
Ha!  Good point!

I like presidents who haven't tried to overthrow the government.
Ain't this a chronological oddity? Two weeks from everywhere.
![gif](giphy|FoH28ucxZFJZu)
Like “The Kraken”
He's been promising that replacement for the ACA going back to 2017 and he's still got nothing. A "concept of a plan" is not a plan. That moment alone lost him the debate, even if he'd been doing well up to that point (and he wasn't doing well).
That could mean nine years or more.
I don't like the guy who has concepts of plans to achieve final solutions. He lost.
Is the plan viable at conception though? The last 8 years tells us that no it wasn’t.
I've got a Theory for a concept for a plan to figure out who won
This. He has had 9 years to come up with a replacement for the ACA…all he has is ‘concepts’ of a plan. Concepts, I might add, created by some good people, the best people.
Turmpf hasn’t passed the sniff test in 30 years
There are quite a few things with trump that don’t pass the sniff test
If it wasn’t obvious, I was only making a joke about how ludicrous that conspiracy theory is
Don’t forget about the abortions at 9 months or post labor. 🤡🤡🤡🤡
Most citizens are eating animals so I won't judge. Ask the 4-H participants what happens to their pets.
Yeah I don’t think bragging about being endorsed from Hungary’s despotic prime minister is the flex Trump thinks it is.
Me turning to the rest of my household “did he just use ‘strongman’ as a compliment??”
My 74yo father thought he looked pathetic and said that Harris “just went out there and castrated him on live television” lol
That was straight fire 🔥🔥🔥.  He CANNOT STAND being ridiculed and mocked and deep down, he knows she’s right.
I think it's actually worth the watch. 

I'm definitely not voting for Trump but I wasn't thrilled to be voting for Harris before last night. She was very natural at times, I feel like I saw who she really is.
I hate his facial expressions. Just the smug smile. But fuck. If the entire debate was just him deflecting and attacking a different point no wonder people are saying it was empty and the issues weren't talked about. Because of course he wouldn't
Bigly mad
“They’re eating animal crackers!”
Straight from the tree 🌴
He even got 5 more min total than Kamala. That was pure narcissism, through and through
Yeah that would’ve definitely destroyed his fragile little ego. I heard Harris went to a campaign event right afterwards so I guess she probably couldn’t do that.

He’s back! And in Pog form! 

(Edit cause phone turned pog to pop).
Some cats really are super chill and will let you do anything. But also given how child actors were treated back then, I wouldn't be surprised if the bar was even lower for animals.
I was thinking about that this morning. I can't believe it's become acceptable to have live fact checking because we know that one candidate is going to lie non stop.
He was the entire Reich wing internet scene in one person, tossing out all of their favorites.  Immigrants eating pets, calling her a Marxist.  it was like watching a FB comment section in real time.
It wasn't random message boards. His VP pick has been saying that shit on the campaign trail, like in the preceding days.
I was talking about this vein with a coworker the other day. We realized a client had been less than truthful about something. And we were struggling to understand why they would, essentially, lie to us. Finally, all I could come up with is that she and I are not liars, so we have a default expectation that others will be truthful with us. And then it’s confusing when we discover some people aren’t. 

MAGAs are the corollary to this. They admire someone who clearly lies all the time, so they assume that everyone lies. And are confused to discover that some people don’t.
Swift is *massively* popular with young women nationwide. Her fan base may skew Left, but the sheer size of it means millions are also Conservative.  
And her statement seemed cared worded not to “preach to the choir” of Liberal fans, but engage with the Conservative ones.  
The Trump team was probably crossing their fingers that she would wimp out like Dwayne Johnson and make some “I won’t endorse anyone because I don’t want to cause division” statement. But she didn’t. She might actually flip some votes.
“Oh my god they fact checked the liar!! That’s so inappropriate! They should fact check the person speaking the truth too!” they’re so ridiculous at this point. Like if Harris had a super obvious lie, like so obvious it needed to be fact checked as much as Trump’s “they’re eating the dogs” line and the “they’re killing the babies after they’re born” line, then I’d like to hear it. 
  
And not a little mistruth or exaggeration, which every candidate does, I mean a very obvious falsehood. If she had a moment where fact-checking was imperative, then they should give evidence of it happening. But they can’t.
But they’re ALL immigrants, that’s the funny part
Yeah. They should just give people opening statements.
Agreed. They specifically ask for a closing statement. Why not ask for an opening one too, especially since you know they’re going to wipe their ass with your first question anyway.
Agreed. They’re going to do it anyway and then skip the question so just let them have an opening statement so they can answer the first question.
They’re allowing illegal immigrants to perform transgender surgery on your children at school and they bill you for it.
I loved that. I literally said "WHAT?!?!?!" and bursted out laughing.
That was one of my favorites!  Like there's illegal immigrant trans factories lmao
Someone cal the police!  I’d like to report a murder.    Hahahha
You win the internet today friend
They really live in an alternate reality. Did you mentioned that Obama wasn’t President when the recession started. And it was his policies that helped us recover from it that trump inherited.
OMG That's what I thought of. When his plan was to crowdsource plans from everyone else lol.

Have to rewatch now lol
🏆
It’s changed to prisons now, because the public school story has fallen flat.
I have to fill out three forms to let my kids have a Tylenol at school and they're just what? Performing gender reassignment surgeries in the gym? School nurse apparently studied just that one surgery, cause the best she does for anything else is put on an ice pack and hope for the best. It gets funnier and more ridiculous the more you think about it, but conservatives won't even take the half-second of thought it takes to realize that because it *feels* true to them.
He says things that you might see on a hand printed, photocopied newsletter written by an unhinged, lunatic racist in the 1980’s and 1990’s that they would hand out to people at local fairs to try and gain converts to their insane ideas and ramblings.

The problem is that in our modern times, actual “Conservative” media puts that stuff onto TV screens, podcasts and more. It’s absolutely bonkers.
Who walks into a Nationally televised presidential debate talking about "concepts of a plan" as their answer for healthcare?
It's coming very soon!
I mean she killed a 78 year old one tonight.
So I heard that right. 🙄
Tariffs raise the cost of those goods to buyers. As someone who owned a business for 20 years, I can assure you that the added costs get passed on to the end users. You either maintain margin, increase volume, or get canned by the Board of Directors. Maximizing shareholder equity is Holy Writ.
The only thing he did as president was golf and sign executive orders. A a businessman during that time, he made bank.
I liked "he hates her." I sincerely doubt that.
I liked Clinton (he later turned out to be a scumbag) I loved Obama and Harris. What’s not to like about Harris?
It's ThE oHiO StAtE
It was actually part of RFK Jr's terms of signing on with Trump, he gets to keep whatever pet carcasses the illegals leave behind.
I think you are on to something — he doesn’t really understand the difference between insane asylum v. political asylum
My mom was baffled when he talked about how asylum because he even said that “Venezuela was so dangerous that people were getting killed by gangs just for living there and that is why we have so many of them applying for asylum and trying to get across the border.” Like, what about that is confusing?? He legit just explained and rationalized why so many from Venezuela are trying to get asylum in the US and then used that as a reason why they didn’t deserve asylum?? I’d have to go back and see exactly what he said, but my mom and I were both like “wtf??”
Because he thinks they just get charged to the foreign countries and they just take the lump. It’s the kind of perpetual-motion machine thinking of a 5 year-old.
He doesn't think raising tariffs will lower costs. Rather, he thinks that a segment of voters thinks (incorrectly) that tariffs are the same as taxes, just charged to someone else instead of us. It's a lie that sounds good to someone that doesn't know any better.
What blows my mind is that this already happened when he jacked up tariffs in his first term. Costs were already skyrocketing prior to the pandemic.
I did watch and I’m also not sure what she supposedly dodged
There’s that saying that goes around sometimes about how women are always viewed as the emotional ones because men’s anger and rage aren’t considered to be “emotional” responses in the same way like crying is, and if you consider anger and rage to be emotional responses, then a lot of men start to look overly emotional 
  
This debate is kinda proof that he is way too emotional to be an effective leader. He just can’t rein them in. He has outbursts all the time
I thought the exact same thing after Trump vs Hilary though. He couldn’t even speak in complete sentences. She trounced him and look what happened.
This is true!
Insecure men are often sensitive about the size of their crowds.
Big, beautiful rallies!
The way his eyes bulged is seared into my brain
If she can do it that easily when he knows he needs to be locked in, think about the absolute cakewalk manipulating this dumb son of a bitch must be for guys like Elon or Putin. Trump is nothing but emotion and instability. Butter him up and he’ll do whatever you want; bait good or bad is irresistible to him
Well good on you for seeing this fool for what he is!  Thanks for your willingness to move away from from him
what would you call "not entirely inaccurate" as opposed to "completely accurate"? She didn't say one untrue thing about him.
34 convictions... so far
Doesn't sound too different from the lake towns here unfortunately
Is you is, or is you AIN’T, my constituency?!?!
He's also now saying that A) he wouldn't replace ACA until he has something better and B) it's the Democrats who refused to work with them to make the ACA run better.

When... A) he and the GOP tried endlessly to remove ACA 8 years ago, and he *still* doesn't have a plan now, so he obviously didn't have one back then. And B) it's always been the GOP who have been trying to kneecap the ACA and refusing to do anything to improve it.
It won’t make a lick of difference, but I find it oddly funny that Trump is running for President like he’s never been President before. I find myself asking, “Then why didn’t you do X when you were in office?”
And as we all know he is great at choosing the best people and not at all obsessed with firing people and calling them incompetent
He talks about how horrible Obamacare is, but for some reason can’t come up with something better.  Go figure.
He had nine years... when he was in office he would literally say he has a plan that would be released 'in about two weeks' and he said it often. Still waiting on those tax returns too.
Trump last night:  https://www.tiktok.com/@theoffice/video/7262778667623910702
Yeah, he will announce his plan in two weeks🤣😂
A lot of people are saying these concepts are great. Many people.
He’s not going to ever have a healthcare plan. First you must care about health, then care about Americans. 

He doesn’t care about anything or anyone besides himself
Let’s not forget, in November of 2016 after he was elected he was on 60 Minutes for an interview. On that interview he said he had an ACA replacement or overhaul plan that was ready to go and would be introduced to the American people before inauguration. That plan was never released or shared, let alone introduced to Congress. And that’s a shame, because he had a majority Congress that could have passed it. Passed it, that is, if it existed.

It went from “it’s ready, and you’ll see it in 2 weeks,” to “I don’t have a majority,” to “it’s too hard,” to “I’m not President so why would I have a plan,” to “I have concepts.” Seems the only thing that happens over the course of these 8 years (and forever, really) with Trump is that we regress and go backward and continually deal with the same lies on repeat.

Even though Harris is imperfect, at least there’s a chance to move forward. Trump needs to go away for good.
The best people but he had to fire half of them 😝
You're about 50 years shy of the truth here.
Most notably the diaper.
![gif](giphy|JxwTIKHi61VxBYOHVQ|downsized)
Once I heard that I was like… yeah he’s done.
I love that Kamala called that out later on too.
It’s so weird to me that his cult of followers can seriously listen to his bullshit and then not only agree but then cheer him on after. On nothing but lies that are extreme and baseless.
Agree. I felt the same way. She impressed me, and now I'm more enthusiastic to cast my vote for her.
Harris played it beautifully. Normally, it’s Trump that goes on the hard offense to have his opponent scramble for a defense. But Harris gave him a taste of his own medicine by setting traps all throughout the debate and then just sat back and smiled as she watched him take the bait and desperately try to defend himself while sounding like an absolute lunatic. She played him like a fucking fiddle. 

This is the beginning of the end for him. He’s cooked and he knows it. Anyone who wasn’t sure who to vote for before sure as hell knows who they’re voting for after last night. The one who spoke in complete sentences, actually answered the questions, spoke about policy, didn’t spew conspiracy theories, and expertly manipulated and commanded her opponent for the entirety of the debate. 

She’s going to win this goddamned election. We just have to do our part and cast our votes for her.
I read the link, great work to uncover this. What I didn’t see in the article were the specific topics and misinformation being spread. I assume they were spreading pro-Trump/anti-Harris false rumors. Any idea of which side they specifically covered?

(Cancel the question….the answer begins on page 85 of the affidavit. Loads of indirect anti-Biden sentiment)
Honestly, that line would have probably worked better for Trump, if he had said that instead lmao.
No I think that was the people fleeing the mental asylum that are doing the transgender surgeries in the schools. Kamala herself is doing the surgeries on the illegal immigrants in the prisons. That’s in between the abortions she’s performing after birth. She’s a busy lady.
![gif](giphy|BUlwrDd97bCYE|downsized)
Cause private prisons can afford them and their money grubbing republican owners love paying for them!
I have a parent with dementia, and the way he was talking about immigrants eating pets is exactly how dementia patients talk.

He's *firmly* convinced it's true because he 'heard it on the TV', and he's all ready to fight about it.  

https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-pushes-baseless-claim-immigrants-eating-pets-rcna170537

Anyone who's dealt with dementia is familiar with this - it's delusion, and it's going to get worse over time.
trumps has been benefitting from "sanewashing". the media won't question trump
Ah yes, the famous 238th trimester abortion
I am 100% aware of this.

I was pointing to another absolutely bonkers statement that Trump made.
Bill Clinton was the politician I was most aligned with policy wise. Thought he was brilliant. But he had the morals of a gutter-snipe and I could not vote for him. Now I didn’t exactly like Hillary, but voted for her enthusiastically. How can people vote for Trump? His moral stench must still permeate the White House.
The level of tariffs he is talking about commiting to and where he intends on applying those tariffs will destroy the "domestic" automarket, used cars will skyrocket in price, same with used parts, most replacement parts are made overseas. 

More foreign cars are produced in the US these days, so we can just say goodbye to the big three and hello to Honda, Toyota, Subaru, BMW and a few others as the major US assembly plants for automobiles. It will devastate the Detroit area, which is "just great", as we've only just recovered from the fallout that created the "rust belt" term in the US.
one could argue much of the inflation they're trying to pin on Biden, was directly caused by his tariff war.
[deleted]
I agree. He was extremely emotional and angry and unhinged. It was good for America to be reminded just why we fired him the first time.
Voter turnout was low in 2016 (I just double checked on census.gov) and it's believed that this is due to complacency, ie, "there's no way that crackpot can win." And he did indeed lose the popular vote. 

We can do this but we have to take our wins and keep on working until that crazy fucker moves to Venezuela for good.
You are 100 percent correct. We must end this moron in November. God help us all if we don’t.
Reminder: they almost killed the ACA. John McCain was the single vote that would've killed it and he famously thumbed it down.
He actively tried to kneecap it in several ways. Removing the insurance proof requirement, adding junk plans to the exchange, etc.
Obama had a great zinger during the DNC where he remarked that now that the ACA is broadly popular, the GOP has stopped calling it Obamacare.
Don't forget that that was with the house and senate majority at the time too. So it's not like you can really claim "but the other side".
“I tried, but it didn’t happen. It would have if it weren’t for those darn <insert latest Trump scapegoat here>.” — DJT, the charlatan
He's too busy asking her why she didn't do anything while in office... As the VICE PRESIDENT. He knows damn well the VP can't pass policy. She should've asked him what policy did Pence enact as VP.
Not to mention he had the majority in BOTH the House and Senate his first 2 years
I seem to remember some actually intelligent people who came to work in the beginning of his first administration.  They left because they got fed up with his stupidity and lies. That was before Trump learned he had to hire only sycophants. Those people called him a moron.
He didn’t pass the sniff test when he was in diapers let alone now.
Haha in your defense, I should’ve added /s since tone and sarcasm is hard to decipher on the internet. And also the fact there are people who legit believe this nonsense
For real, few Americans know who Orban is and if they do it's not likely a good opinion. Trump has no good character witnesses, it's Hulk Hogan, Russian shills and a bunch of dictators backing him.
For them it's only about owning the libs.
Yeah.  It's sad seeing the group texts if misguided "friends" who actually think he won.
It's completely baffling!!
Agreed. It definitely helped solidify my vote. TBH not a big Kamala fan. So far really like her VP pick, Tampon boy, and that was one of my 2 reasons for voting for her. 
1.) not the other option 
2.) like tampon man

I thought she carried herself well. I didn’t appreciate the little jabs at Trump tho. 
I hate how childish it all is. I was hoping she was be better at that in a debate setting. But I get it in the big picture sense… so who cares ig. 

My problem with Kamala is she’s not putting out her views and goals as much as I’d like a president to talk. Trump doesn’t shut up about his views and goals… views and goals that I do not want for the country. 

This debate helped me feel confident in voting for her. Before the debate all I knew she was running on was “yay abortion and boo Trump” and that was honestly good enough for the time being. But I wanted more from her. Which I think we got.
She was able to get across her views pretty well. And her basic idea of a goal that she said she has a plans for, but I haven’t looked into that so idk. this made me think like… “ok maybe she’ll actually do something” rather than just “welp… guess this is as good as it gets”
[Does it, though? lol](https://youtu.be/5DkM0l2osSo?si=xglt-9Bl11RxSPZk)
Prisons largely deny transgender care and housing requests. It’s not a thing that happens, really.
As someone who cared for his father with dementia until he passed away, I couldn't agree more. But I also kept him from driving, my firearms, and phone scammers. I didn't nominate him for POTUS.
I know. My grandfather had dementia, my father had a psychotic break many decades ago and would latch onto those kind of ideas too. My mother, seems to be starting down that path, herself.
That one really pissed him off. "But the man on television said it! Did you see the man on TV??" He was genuinely angry. This fool would ignore scientists, doctors, generals, and national security advisors to go with "the man on TV" and it's absurd.
I apologize for coming off like I was calling you out. I was arguing against DTs logic and not yours. Tariffs can be a "good" thing if very carefully applied AND we had similar industries set up that could replace the same goods at the same or lower price point. But  allowing a middle class to exist without using slave labor makes that a very hard thing to achieve. Especially when competing nations have no problem with using slave labor.
The thing with inflation, is that EVERYONE that studies economics knew we would see inflation, not just from Trump’s stupid ego-driven tariffs wars, but mostly from the pandemic stimulus money. EVERY economist. Even Bush’s economic advisor, who is generally a very anti-handouts and anti-socialism guy, at the beginning of the pandemic was like, “stimulus checks and stuff will definitely cause inflation in the long term, but we should just do it anyway, pay people to stay home, and deal with the inflation later because controlling the pandemic is a bigger priority” and then people were SHOCKED that there was inflation 
  
It’s been driving me crazy. Everyone knew there’d be inflation from the stimulus checks! That’s how inflation happens! If anything, Biden’s fed picks should be praised for getting it under control so quickly and keeping it from getting worse so we didn’t enter a recession. Like inflation has already started slowing, fed is starting to slowly lower rates, and it’s only been a few years. That’s kinda impressive. It may not FEEL impressive on a personal level because we’re still adjusting to stuff being so expensive (so so expensive), but that’s kinda just how inflation works.
Absolutely, or whatever you call the extreme price gouging that is rampant across the entire economy. Prices were forced up in some places because of the tariffs, other industries followed suit because fuck it, then the pandemic hit and skewed a lot of buying power for working class people. I would say another factor were those PPP loans.

I am *not* an economist though. Or even particularly good at math. Just have been very aware how fucked the economy was when Trump was in office.
That was a good dodge, especially as she turned it around and pointed out that Trump refused to answer the abortion ban veto question. 

I also remember thinking she dodged the first question, but I can no longer remember what the question was. I just remember noting that she pivoted and largely didn’t answer it, then Trump opened his mouth and started spewing shit and it didn’t matter anymore.
She did a good job of not falling into his trap. Because if a woman miscarries at 9 months and needs the dead fetus removed she needs an “abortion”. But of course if she says that, she will get nailed with “she said 9 months!” So imo that’s not really a fair question. Surprise surprise, look who asked it lol   

Dodging and not responding to Trump is not the same thing. He’s not running the debate, he doesn’t get to set the questions. 
She did say just codifying the protections of *Roe*, which I thought was a fine answer.
49 million people owe that thumb some gratitude for this one act.
A true hero, until the very end. Respect. ❤
Kid rock and Roseanne lmao
"All we gotta do is make ourselves look ridiculous for years on end and stick to that, that'll show em."
This. Their movement isn’t based around Trump, it’s an intense reaction to the growth of progressive ideas lately, especially related to gender and sexuality. Trump appeared at the right time and place.
Right, because they are privately owned by money grubbing assholes that don’t give a fuck about the people they house, only the money they get from the government for each person they incarcerate.
And thousands of jobs were lost in industries related to steel due to his tariffs.
right. there are too many things that could happen in a pregnancy at any time too go onto on a debate stage. the right answer is thay it isn't the government's business
The other verified instances of later term (22 weeks on) abortion I have seen are when incapacitated (like a coma) or severely disabled women are raped and then the subsequent pregnancy is not caught by caregivers for a long time afterwards.  Whether that be because they do not show, or the caregiver is covering up the pregnancy.

Also women who were trying to seek an earlier abortion but could not get one in their state, delaying the procedure 

[Detailed source on abortion reasons and how rare these abortions are](https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/issue-brief/abortions-later-in-pregnancy-in-a-post-dobbs-era/)
Same. She answered the question, just didn’t give them the answer they wanted to hear.
I think he earned the lasting respect of a lot of people when he did that. 

Right up to his death.
An angle I wish the dems would play more:

You are a young woman who really wants to start a family. But then you get an ectopic pregnancy, where the egg is fertilized in the fallopian tube. This is not a viable pregnancy and very dangerous, it needs to be removed. "Oh I'm sorry, that would be an abortion, we cannot remove the fertilized egg." So it is allowed to grow (extremely painful) until it bursts the fallopian tube, which can cause a woman to bleed to death, and can also obviously hurt her chances to conceive later.

So because a woman WANTS to get pregnant, she is now dead. That's the kind of "family planning" situation you put people in. Why would ANY woman risk trying to conceive if this is a possibility?

"Abortion" is healthcare. Pregnancy is complicated and can be dangerous. It can be very scary. Restricting what doctors think is best in favor of what non-medical professional voters and politicians think is bad. It's very, very, very obvious. I feel like it just needs to be ELI5ed to Americans. For too long it's just been about "baby killing" when it really isn't.
Republicans literally tried to pass a bill saying that ectopic pregnancies can be reimplemented. No I'm not joking.
The thing is that they do say this.  I see/hear it everywhere, out of the mouths of women. 

But we are not only fighting against decades of lies about abortion, but a deep-seated belief from so many people that women shouldn’t be able to decide even if they could.  They don’t listen to women, our voices are not valid to them.

A lot of this is about controlling women, and they will lie cheat and beat until they get what they want and no complaints.
Would people support a ballot initiative to block corporate ownership of houses?
 For the last decade I’ve worked in real estate. As an underwriter, loan office, and eventually running a brokerage. Over the last few years I’ve watched many of my clients and heard of the clients of others in my community losing out on houses because a large investor came in with cash.

This seems to be a growing trend across the country. I’m of the mind that houses should go to families first, lest we become a state of renters. 

So here’s what I’m proposing, houses can’t be owned by companies (asterisks). I see no issue in companies buying houses that are in disrepair to flip to sell. I also know builders own houses for a bit and think new construction could be excluded from a ban. 

Basically make it so that houses can only be held long term by individuals. 

So Michigan, what am I missing? I know trusts and landlords that put houses into a llc could get sticky. What else? Is this even a good idea? Would people support it?
I would - but it would need to be clearly defined and no vague bullshit at all. It could be ripe for abuse or hurt others
This is the kind of thing that feels like it has repercussions that aren't going to be obvious to laymen. I'd like to support it but I'd want to hear opinions from industry and government experts.
I would support this.
I would absolutely support this but said big companies have big paychecks for big court battles.  It'd be tough to do but I feel it's the right thing.
Singapore started hitting buyers and sellers of property with massive tax rates: [Singapore Hikes Property Tax, Doubling Rate on Foreigners to 60%](https://archive.ph/1gQ5F)

I think taxing the hell out of investment property when it is bought or sold and income from the property is the best way forward. Give current investors a one-year period where they can sell before the tax is put into place, and then tax the buying, selling, and income from investment properties. 

The only way to stop investors is to chop away at the return on the investment.
I'm of the opinion that companies are only investing in houses like they are because they recognized the drastic under supply problem, and are capitalizing on it. Work to improve zoning, streamline the building process, and in general make it easier for more homes to exist, and corporate investment becomes a non-issue IMHO.

**ETA:** Here's a nice write-up by a much smarter guy than me on the issue that I very much agree with: https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2024/2/21-going-after-corporate-homebuyers-good-politics-ineffective-policy
I think the category you're missing are corporations that own houses as long term lodging for employees. We have a technical center in Michigan, and sometimes a VP or small group of test engineers will stay for an indefinite amount of time to work out of the tech center. That house makes more sense than a month-to-month apartment lease or hotel. Plus, it's an asset that has appreciated since the company bought it, so it still helps the company even if it sits vacant for the time it's not used. 

With that said, I'd still support an initiative to prevent corporations from owning houses.
I've always thought a good way to structure this is that no person, entity (including subsidiaries or LLC's under the same founder)  can own more than 3 residential properties total in the state.
I absolutely would. My neighborhood is inundated with Berkshire Hathaway owned rentals. They're creating an artificial shortage to drive up the prices. It hurts renters that would like to buy and private owners alike.
Ballot initiatives are too much of a sledge-hammer.  This situation is nuanced, nuance has no place on a ballot.  The \*right\* way to go about this is to have our legislators address the issue because, that's literally what we pay them for.
It’s tough because although regular ppl would support it, the billionaires make policies in this country so there would be loopholes for sure even if the laws change.
I would
I would sign the petition
It’s just a symptom of an underlying problem: too many barriers to housing development. I’d focus on that before trying to bandaid over the secondary repercussions of the housing market’s supply shortage.

If housing were abundant enough to remain affordable, it would be a terrible investment for these corporations and the “problem” of corporate ownership would solve itself.
I would support such a proposal, if someone can convince me that experts have had a say as to the details, as opposed to a knee jerk poorly written bill written purely by legislators.  I am not one of those experts.
Yes.
Yes
There are local companies that own nice homes in good school districts that they keep for new executive hires to ease them into the community. I think keeping foreign investors out would be a help. Especially with farm land. It all makes me nervous as our economy has always thrived in the free market.
Not everyone is ready for even wants to own a house.

This is why rental properties -  including rental homes -  exist.  An outright ban on company ownership of single family homes would probably result in an increase in vacant houses - something that is already  a huge problem here.
For one, you're assuming buyer with a lot of cash = corporation. If someone from California sells their house for a million dollars, they can easily buy a house outright with cash in Michigan. Even if they had a mortgage, just the equity profit alone can buy a house here.

Second, you'd have to look at all the reasons *why* a corporation would buy a house, and it's not always for investment. Sometimes a company will buy a building for executives or other employees to live in. Companies that hire a lot of immigrant labor will buy housing for their laborers.

It's really really difficult to enforce rules regarding intention, and companies would use that to get around the law. It's extremely difficult to prove what someone intended when buying property.

A lot of problems seem to have simple solutions on the surface, but if you dig down, the devil is in the details.
People often misidentify the problem for many things as being with "corporations" without actually addressing the root problem.

There are many legit reasons for corporations to own multiple houses. All housing cooperatives and most other non-profit housing are corporations. You might form a corporation for many legal reasons to settle an estate or rent out to someone - even if it is not-for-profit. Most landlords are running through corporations even if they just have 1 house as an independent landlord. Some people don't incorporate with more.

What there should be are additional property taxes if you own more than one habitable property that you or your dependents are not claiming residency in. Perhaps even make a tiered system. And this should *not* apply to certain cooperatives like the ones mentioned above (housing cooperatives should not be paying state property taxes in Michigan, but thanks to some legal fuckery under the definition of "cooperative housing" at the federal level, they still do - except in Ann Arbor, now). Maybe make the taxes based on the zoning and property type. 

If it costs increasingly more in taxes for each additional property, it disincentivizes anyone (corporation or not) from accumulating property. The problem is structuring it and getting legislators to even consider it.
Be careful what you ask for.. some people, once they own homes, put them in trusts, to avoid them being taken in a liability lawsuit. A trust can be considered a company of sorts.
This kind of ballot measure is a band aid that doesn’t address the problem. We need to address *why* corporations are buying up all these properties and make it less enticing of an investment. 

The easier and cheaper fix that doesn’t add more expensive regulation is to make it easier for home builders to build affordable homes. Make it easier to rezone and easier to get permits so cheaper homes are easier and cheaper to build.
It would never make the ballot corporate ownership has always cherry picking the best property already that I would be in favor of.But in this case and like many most of this property in Michigan is owned outside of Michigan. So what I seen during the last bubble was 4 or 5 brokerage companies got a pool of cash together and basically bought out Entire blocks and will hold them hostage .
Yes
💯
I would.
Just need to give prioritized buying in order of citizens of said city, citizens of State, then outside influences. 

Might not be perfect but it would help.
I would fully support this
Sounds good, just don't screw over farmers that have their homes owned by their farm business.
Assisted living group homes should be excluded.
I support this in general.  Zillow and other hedge fund owners are making single family homes across the US inaccessible.  The home prices are too damn high!
I would absolutely support this get corporations out of housing. I barely tolerate landlords as it is because there are too few of them that are ethical.
I would support it but as someone that has worked on ballot initiatives, how exactly would it get funded? That’s where these things go wrong. The people putting up the money expect something or a loophole for them.
yup.
It would likely lose at the ballot box, because they will run fear mongering style (although in this case accurate) ads stating Initiate X will decimate your home's value.  People who don't own houses will vote against it for the same reason non wealthy sole proprietorship owners vote Republican.  Because they think they are part of the "in" class.
I think just limiting the amount of housing units they own to a certain percent of the total pool. If they need to further increase profits they're more than welcome to build more housing.
It would have to depend on what the asterisks were. Some ppl buy houses under llcs to avoid stalkers.
I don't think the supreme court would uphold that. Maybe like a no corporate housing zone.
Can you define “corporate”? My family owns property through an LLC but we don’t operate the property like a business as in rental or anything commercial.
Yes. Home ownership needs to be protected from corporate interests. It's a part of the American dream.
Yes I would. I would also vote for statewide regulations on Airbnbs that are similar to what NYC incorporated. Airbnb is decimating the local populations of small rural tourist areas in the Upper Peninsula.
> I also know builders own houses for a bit and think new construction could be excluded from a ban. 

We have a builder that wants to buy two vacant lots on our private road to build two new houses specifically as Airbnbs or hotels.

The law would have to be written to cover loopholes.

But yes, I support no corporate ownership.
No because there will be fallout from such a law or maybe you call it unintended consequences
A llc is a company i onow of many people who form companies buy a bunch of house rent out and flip some of them. So no i dont support your law
I'd support the shit out of it (asterisks)
I damn sure would.  I would also support efforts to end corporate personhood.
Happening all over the country - the goal is so that you don’t own anything, but eternally pay rent. Corporate slumlords. If you are a homeowner and you keep getting phones calls from strangers who offer to buy your house - this is what the ultimate goal is.
They did that in my city to stop new apartments
My only thing with this is I wonder what would happen to houses in college towns. It was my understanding a great portion of these are not privately owned but rather managed by some company and rented.
Seems like a great idea but they’d just loophole the hell out of it eventually. 😒
I would 💯💯💯💯💯support this. Investors/ corporations are making home ownership unattainable. At the very least we should be able to put a provision that only allows from private buyers.
Why not tax the heck out of it instead?  

Like owner-occupied homes taxed at 1% a year vs 10% a year for corporate landlords, then use the proceeds to support affordable housing.
Fuck yes I would.
This is essentially banning rental homes. Do you think people who want to rent shouldn't be allowed to rent houses? They should be relegated to apartments?

Edit:I assumed most landlords would incorporate for tax reasons but I guess that is not the case so nevermind.

I guess I wonder why we are even legislating over the 4% of houses that are corporate owned though. I'm currently renting from a corporation and it's both better and cheaper than it was when I rented a similarly sized home from an individual.
Capitalism will find away to skirt around any new rules, but I would support that kind of initiative. I would be more likely to support a cap on how much rents can be raised. Keep that pegged to inflation or something.
I am an individual who owns a few rentals.  How do you see this play out?  Am I a corporation?  Will the people who buy the few properties that I'm presumably forced to sell be able to afford a new roof, furnace, etc when the time comes?

I'd love to build affordable housing if I had the money and it was profitable.  However, all the zoning and permit process, sadly, makes this impossible.
I would support this as long as clearly defined
yes
I'd prefer to exempt primary residence from property taxes, then heavily tax income properties. Something to that effect.
Fuck yea. Let’s do it.
I would support this up to the point of volunteering to get signatures 

A whole generation is getting screwed, we have to do something - we've already lost the America we were promised as kids, now we must do the work to build one for the next gen
Nope, I would not support this. I get what people want to solve for, but you're not going to fix 2009 with more restrictions. Housing construction essentially stopped entirely for a few years and millennials are in their prime home buying years. Add in onerous zoning restrictions and it's not going to improve, price wise, anytime soon.

There's trust planning concerns, flipping concerns (there's a lot of value in someone taking a condemned house and making it good again), and some below that come to mind (by no means an exhaustive list):

Moreover, "long term" in the financial sense generally means 1 year or more. What if I've got a couple of friends and we each have teenage children that are planning on going to the same college. Should we be excluded from buying a place and renting it to whomever until the kids go to college just because we decided to form an llc?

What if I'm in the construction business and I'm building a new nuclear reactor (6-8 years), liquid natural gas export terminal, or [insert large project that takes years]? Should I be excluded from buying housing as part of employee compensation?

What if I run a shelter of some kind (recovering addicts, domestic violence victims, etc.) and split a few houses into townhouses/separate apartments? Would that be allowed?

As a seller, why should I be forced to take a lower offer?

Restrictions aren't the answer, it's just going to cause more problems and there will inevitably be bigger players that get certain exemptions that work for their model that excludes others. If we want more affordable housing, it needs to start with ending zoning restrictions and allowing more dense housing in more areas. 

Financial literacy is lacking for most and in today's market, in most places I've seen in my limited experience (been buying and selling the last 6 years, not moving again though, eff that) the cash offer is practically always significantly lower than the list amount (at least 10% lower). 

On 2 of the places I sold (lived in both for just over 2 years) I had one offer on each come in way under list (30% under list). On the one place, my ex and I got an offer in that was well under the list price, way under the average price in the area for the time period, asked that I pay ALL their closing costs, asked for a $10k flooring allowance (all the flooring was maybe 2 years old throughout the house), and was contingent on the sale of their current place (which wasn't even on the market).Ex and I gave all that feedback to our realtor and all we heard back on that offer was, "they're just selling to big investors for cash, they only care about money".

Well, ofc I only care about money, that's what every arm's length seller really cares about is money. There's a ton of things in place to prevent discrimination; everyone is incentivized to look at just the money portion. If people aren't getting their offers accepted, their offers probably suck comparatively. 

ETA: each time I've sold, it's been to an individual/family and I didn't know that was the case until basically right before closing doing a final walk through with the buyer.
Not without plenty of reasonable exceptions. 

For example, the homes owned by the mega-dairies to house the immigrant workers or something like the homes/barracks owned by the foundry to also house immigrant workers.
I would vote yes
Absolutely. I would like to refine it a little bit more than just corporations, but they're definitely needs to be some sort of action taken
Yes yes a thousand times yes. Obviously the details are important (duh) but so many people on here commenting on the potential danger when there is real danger happening right now to actual people in out current system. We must demand that housing is not an investment it's a requirement to live.
As a landlord, I fully support this. Multifamily housing is necessary, so corporations should own apartments, but houses should be off limits.
There isn't even a 0.1% chance that this would pass. It doesn't matter how many people supported it. It's unrealistic.
My concern is all of the work arounds and loop holes. I think we should just raise property taxes and give a lump sum discount for primary residence
I'm sure you'll find all sorts of support for it on reddit.  You'll have to go out into the real world to get a real answer
Nah, just tie all property to an SSN. 1st property is your house, you get homestead exemption. 2nd property is vacation or rental, taxed like it is now at the normal rate without homestead. 3rd property is double the tax rate. 4th property is quadruple the tax rate. 5th property is octuple the tax rate. Etc
It is not a good idea, and even if it were, it would be unconstitutional.  
100%
Absolutely, as long as it's written well enough to actually be effective and doesn't have any loopholes that would let companies circumvent it via the courts or something.
You could also take an economic pressuring route. Primary residences and even secondaries are taxed normally, but after a certain number, taxes begin to climb incrementally until your 10th house is taxed at 90% or something.


But even this, as other commenters mentioned, would require tons of asterisks and could be exploited in ways I can't think of. We need experts to meet and discuss viable paths forward.


We also need to increase the housing supply (taking current population growth and house-decay metrics into consideration). Tax breaks for construction companies, reexamination of housing regulations, multi-tenant housing, dense construction, etc.
in theory yes, but in practice how do you do that? Does that mean no more trusts, c corps, llc's, etc... can own any type of housing?
I think it's great sentiment but the execution is near impossible. Some people keep real property in their holding companies for various reasons. The use cases for legal entities in real estate transactions are so diverse, I'm not sure a law can navigate the subtleties of hedge fund ownership vs not. And such an initiative could do just as much harm as the help it's trying to offer.
Supreme Court would throw it because capitalism.
This feels like it would inevitably be an equal protections clause case, which probably wouldn't fare well in litigation, especially when considering current jurisprudence in this country regarding corporations as people.  More power to ya though, and I wish you luck.
Absolutely!! SFH are for the people NOT businesses!!!
I certainly would! Our family home on S. Forest was sold after being in the family for 67 years. The people we sold it to left it pretty much unchanged. But then they sold it to a big corporate company and those people made it into this giant mcmansion rooming house. Every time I go by I want to cry. This was a beautiful house with an art studio in the back, a little tiny koi pond, and a beautiful garden my grandmother attended. It broke my heart and it's gone forever.
Some good ideas in here (ie; increase the taxes and use the money to help the homeless/underhomed), and I’d support this is whatever form it appeared. Get the ballot initiative going!
How about a bill to stop foreign entities from buying land and businesses in Michigan...namely, China
I'd totally support this but it absolutely has to be written clearer than the sky. Michigan has so much open acreage in terms of farm land and forestry. This needs to be protected. The normal ownership of a regular house in a fashion that is affordable for the regular person needs to be protected. I'm confident everybody's done with corporate dickery in our everyday lives. Protect our lands, protect the rights to resources on that land (Water rights, mineral rights, etc) from corporate greed. Protect the ability to own a home, for the regular person. And we could all learn a lesson from what's happened to the water rights along rivers out west, the Colorado River and such.  Yo, we can do better than that.  And fuck Nestlé. Yall got took
Yep. People should be able to buy houses to live in before companies/landlords swoop in and turn things into rentals. 

"I worked hard to earn enough to gouge people who haven't lived as long as me."
1 million times 'yes'
This should be what the homestead tax exemption does, but it’s not large enough. Part of a homestead property value is exempt from property taxes. Homestead applies for one house that you live in, whether owned by yourself or your personal trust. This shifts taxes to multi family owners, landlords and corporations.
Removing a large group of buyers with deep pockets would tank housing pricings, which is probably your intention.  That's good for individual home ownership.  But property taxes are based on house price.


Property taxes pay for schools, libraries, parks, emergency services, etc.  if you lose that funding, you have to raise taxes elsewhere or decrease services.  Without combining it with a tax increase, your services are being cut.  With a tax increase, you're in for an iffy vote on getting it passed.


With the way the property taxes are capped, I believe a lot of long time homeowners could still see increases in their taxes if their assessed value and SEV are far enough off.  Even so, you're handicapping funding.
LLCs, partnerships, Trusts etc?
my parents spent 2 years looking for a house and each time they got out bid by " someone" offering cash. i would absolutely support this cause the house they ended up with, ended up having so many issues but they had to settle for it because they kept getting out bid by what the relator called " random cash offerings".
There a regular homeowners that have their homes in the name of a trust not investors,

So many people can’t buy a house or don’t want to, and they want to rent .
if you drastically reduce the number of rentals out there supply is going to be even less and rents will be even higher due to supply and demand …. Unless I’m missing something that’s a possible outcome
I worked for a company that our largest customer was out of state and the site was in the middle of fucking nowhere - like the closest hotel was over an hour away and it felt like we always had someone on site there for some reason or another. So after all the costs of hotels, they ended up buying a small ranch-style house for employees to stay. I don't have an issue with a company owning a property as long as they're actually using it.

I do have a major issue with my coworker who owns 6 properties and rents them out. I think anything over 2 properties should be taxed the ever loving fuck out of to the point where it would not be profitable to rent out.
When you talk about "corporate" are you talking about a Delaware company that owns 1000 house but also a local neighbor that still has a day job, that owns five houses and has also incoperated as an LLC? One of them works in a cubical next to me, he's not making any incremental profit in landlording but the equity he's building in them is his retirement investment. 

Would there be enough supply for people that want to rent a house, either because they can't come up with a down payment for a house or move often or on short notice?
Decommodify housing. Easier said than done.
Doesn't the Moroun family do this except they collect to make  large tracts of property to rezone it then sell it to other companies to make into factories and such?
Maybe a mandatory tax that grows exponentially with each additional property beyond the first. Tax the piss out of them and they’ll stay away. Not just corporations, but anyone who owns more than one house. Stop this property hoarding by the slumlords too. I don’t mind the little guy with his little 1-2 bnb side hustle, but more than that seems to lead to greed.
Not a good idea, corporations provide housing for employees…more government is not the answer here but less restrictions on new development. The government has tripled the cost to produced a house, why?
Lobbying and wealth inequality is the root issue, this could have been stopped long ago.
Most landlords put their property in an LLC to lessen risk so saying no companies could own houses is just not going to get any support.
Hell no.
Really  what need to get passed is a law against short term rentals, and one  that limits the amount of  an individual can  own homes for rentals.  Because at some point you should move from. Individual homes to an apartment building or complex. Just a thought.
I think a person or corporate entity should only be able to hold a certain limit of properties. In case of residential homes at a time. It should be severely limited to maybe 10 in order to avoid overpricing on homes.
Hell yes i would. That is a huge cause of driving prices up. And yet I see millennials saying “gee thanks boomers”. As if they did it 🤦‍♂️.
I would too
Heck monopolies in general need restrictions
I absolutely would support legislation to address this issue.
Do you think we can outlobby/outspend/outbribe the corporations? Because that's how laws get made...
Absolutely. Personally, I don't think anyone should be allowed to own more than two residential properties, total. Full stop.
I would.
Couldn’t we adjust property taxes to property owned? I feel that’s the easiest way.
YES. YES. A THOUSAND TIMES YES. A MILLION TIMES YES. I would help campaign for this, I would help fund this.
i will never rent again, im not retiring in an apartment trying to decide between my overpriced health coverage or my overpriced rent
Yeah I like the idea and ... –you probably already know from what you said about trusts etc. Being tricky but spelling it out to think out loud and for others too– I think we'd want an exemption to something like a community land trust or maybe (this might get fuzzy) housing with very strong community benefits agreements that remain under public/community accountability with some legally binding repercussions that are more than just a slap on the wrist.


At the same time, nonprofits like Southwest Solutions also can (and have) buy up housing and do crappy things just to increase property values (like bought out housing for the mentally ill and unstable and evicted them with no backup housing to turn into more lucrative housing) the same as for profit ventures by acting as a Community Development Corporation and/or educational nonprofit. So again community stakeholder accountability would be a key leverage point and balance to consider.


Maybe have a progressive scale for the transactions, entities involved, and portfolio sizes/values + plausibly projected values (to gaurd against the John Hantz "farms" residential-to-agriculture rezoned land grab version of Walmart's Dark Store Tax evasion and property valuation strategy there might be some existing precedent for protection on that now though in other states: https://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/story/news/local/2023/02/21/dark-store-ruling-gives-wisconsins-cities-villages-and-towns-hope/69924128007/)?   


Also look into whatever Century Capital Partners (? Might be just called Century Partners, it's the Detroit real estate development company that gives neighbors equity on a house or in a portfolio of houses bought and sold in the neighborhood) in case there are other creative but publicly beneficial exemptions to be made for some more social/community based enterprise minded business models. 


 I think there's a community real estate education nonprofit (Building Community Value is the name maybe?) in Detroit led by a Detroit born resident that would be a good stakeholder to consult, engage in, or coalesce with on this topic too.
Yes.
Don't ban it, tax it!

LLC's pay, I dunno, 500% property tax rates on single family homes.
In general, yes.  But the devil is in the details.  

As you pointed out there are valid reasons for corporations to own homes, but as long as the law were written intelligently and had reasonable exceptions I'd support it 100%.

Another idea I've floated a couple times is to pass a law where for the first X days (I flip between 30 and 60) a residential property is on the market, only primary residence offers can be made.  So it doesn't ban corporations from owning properties, but it gives homeowners a period of time to get offers in and hopefully accepted before the corporations come in and make their cash offers.
Bloomberg recently had a story that stated large corporations only own 1% of the housing stock.  The real problem is the large number of retail investors who own a small number of homes.  I don’t think your proposal would affect that segment.
Whenever it comes to law, better idea wins over legislation every time. I don’t like what’s going on and passing laws never work. They’ve got big lawyers. They’ll find a way around it.  I think a development could have a deed restriction against such a thing. Developing a neighborhood is not an easy thing… Neither is passing laws.
Because when you have a mortgage, that means you don't own the house. The bank does.  Or at least would, if you stop paying.

So unless you plan on eliminating the existence of foreclosure, or loans secured by the property itself, there's not really a way to distinguish between a company owning a house as their business, or a company owning a house because of foreclosure.
Cash offers from investors are regularly outbidding your clients? 🤔
People yes. Michigan politicians on all sides- no.
You can easily limit ownership by parent entities to 3 or 4 homes.  While not common it does happen if parents die a couple could wind up with 3-6 homes and vacation properties and these could become private ownership rentals, etc…but placing limits on holding companies buying hundreds of homes in order to drive up rents…that can be controlled.  Corporations are stealing the American dream by buying up huge numbers of homes so ordinary people could be forced to rent forever, which means housing cost rises every year therefore ability to save as you get older becomes harder so it will prevent people from saving for retirement…
 My concern would be in regards to fraternities/sororities. I would imagine most fraternities have an established LLC to legally hold the fraternity house. I feel like individual ownership of frat houses would be untenable in the long run.
Eliminate the hedge fund investors
Legalese aside, which can be ironed out by people smarter than me, I am 100% on board with a ban on corporate ownership of SFH. In fact, I am so on board with this I will literally volunteer to collect peition signatures for a ballot measure if you're serious about organizing something
Uh yeah that's not a fucking disaster waiting to happen, I feel like housing prices would be fucked immediately from corporations buying up then once they got it jacked up to the point only corporations can own souds like monopoly hell.
Put a high tax on additional property ownership beyond 2. Don’t lend more than 2 conforming mortgages to any individual or LLC at a time. If an LLC is partly or wholly owned by you the limit shared.
Absolutely
ABSOLUTELY. After the Flint water crisis hit international news, we have had corporations buying up houses and not allowing people to rent or buy them. Many aren't keeping the houses or the lawns up, which doesn't help our property values but does encourage blight, rodents and crime. All by design so they can buy up properties cheaper and sell higher to developers who want to make industrial parks where neighborhoods currently are.
I would support not allowing corporations to own single family housing at the federal level. It’s a direct manipulation of the market
All housing units must be traced back to a human.
I'd support it if it also included forced upzoning, otherwise no.
No. Because you won't be able to source a loan anymore for property.
Yessssss
Fuck black rock that is all
I just lost a house I was going to buy to an investor last week. They went way above asking price and no inspection. I couldn't compete. I would love for this to be law.
Yes!
The asterisks will not change anything. There will always be a way to fit into the asterisk. 

Without asterisks it won't get enough support. Landlords will get current tenants to vote against under the premise they may quit renting if it passes. It's the same logic why people have voted against utility reform in the past. The utilities all said rates would skyrocket.
Yes, do this!
The government has no business telling me how many houses my company can own.
I would.
Yes, enthusiastically.
Hell yeah. Blackrock Investments is part of this problem. They Manage 9.1 Trillion Dollars in the USA... They use that money also to buy properties that families should be buying.
Hell yes!!!
Don’t forget many individuals create and LLC for liability protection of personal assets. This includes small scale landlords.
I would
What if we just built more houses and changed zoning to allow it? Maybe even change the property tax to a land value tax.
I know I would.
Yes
I would limit single family ownership to individuals over the age of 17. I would also double property taxes for each home owned beyond the first. You own 10, 200,000 dollar homes and pay 2k property tax on the first one? 2nd one is 4k, 3rd one is 8k, 4th one is 16k a year etc..
I would
Since banks provide housing loans, what bank would give you a loan if they could not take ownership of your house if you defaulted?
Omg I totally would. My wife and I are trying to buy our first home rn and it is utter hell and depressing to even watch housing just get eaten by private equity firms, raising the costs to entry and not even giving us a chance. 
Everyone with a house probably likes it because it makes their house worth more
Absolutely, yes. Full support.
Minus your exceptions, I agree. No exceptions. Fucking hate house flippers too. 
Define corporation, and then try to stop people from registering 87,000 llc's that all hold 2 houses and are subsidiaries of pass-throughs of trusts that link to shell companies that are all owned by Black Rock or Goldman.
I don't necessarily need to see it banned. I would like to see a large tax on properties that sit empty as a way to prevent landlords from using scarcity to drive up prices. Also some anti-monopoly rules where they are limited to how many can be owned in a single town.
It wouldn't pass because Republicans would do TV and AM radio ads saying it was woke or some bullshit and it would fail overwhelmingly 
Yes, but it wouldn’t make much of a difference in the progression of gentrification, housing supply & demand nor in the cost of living. 

Legislation we really need is to allow for higher density housing, rezone all across the state to allow more mix-use blocks with medium density housing and low density housing to have businesses within their neighbourhoods, increasing the walkability of cities & town across all Michigan. 

We need more trains, pedestrian friendly infrastructure and more urban communities gardens.
Yes
A new law is needed prohibiting purchase and ownership of single family homes for the purpose of rentals of any kind.  Corporations are free to build or purchase multi unit rentals zoned as commercial property.  
By definition, a home that is zoned residential should not be rented or Airbb’d because that is running a business and should only be allowed in areas zoned commercial.
In short, if you buy a single family home, only you and/or your family can live there. No renting it.
No. I would, however, support an initiative that would ban the ***long term*** ownership of housing by corporations.
No.

At it's core a house is just a structure that people live in. If businesses see houses as an investment it's because there's something causing a supply/demand imbalance that make houses a better investment than conventional instruments like stocks and bonds. If you banned companies from owning homes you'd have the same problem as you do right now.

Corporate entities' only own 3.8% of houses. And most of those are in very high rent costal areas where it would literally be cheaper to buy a house and let your employees live there than pay the employee enough to afford rent.

If we want to solve housing we need to solve what's causing the supply/demand imbalance.

1. Cost of construction. Everything is expensive to build right now whether it's a single family home, an apartment complex, a road, or a park bench. The cost of lumber and concrete are impacted by industry regulations, the cost of labor is up, the cost of permitting is up, and the requirements for new construction are much more stringent then they used to be. In the 1960s they could build thousands of homes that working class Americans could buy. They were poorly insulated, single level, ranch style houses that were good for sleeping, eating, and bathing in and not much else. Today they have to be insulated, vented, sealed, and all the new appliances have to be energy star compliant to qualify for certain tax credits. All of which increases the cost of construction considerably (ever notice that the HVAC on new houses tends to kind of suck?). 

To alleviate that we could loosen regulations on lumber and concrete. We could reduce the quality requirements for new construction. And we could extend the tax credits for new construction to allow for less efficient appliances and HVAC to be installed. 

2. Human migration. NAFTA basically gutted regional light and heavy manufacturing, which in turn gutted most of the rural American economy. Everything from tractor parts to aluminum ladders used to be produced on a local or regional level by tool & die businesses, small factories, and medium sized regional facilities. Now the only sources of income that rural communities have are farming, retail commerce, tourism, and welfare. As a result, tens of millions of rural residents have moved into the suburbs. So you have more people competing for the same plots of land, which increases demand for a product that we can't make any more of (can't make more land, and building is expensive (see point 1)). Meanwhile there are tons of cheap houses and properties out in rural America that nobody wants to live in.

To alleviate the demand glut I'd suggest levying a substantial tax on international telework to offset construction of highspeed internet infrastructure in rural areas. Then once the infrastructure is sufficiently developed, start putting hard limits on international telework and having people in rural America pick up those jobs. $24k a year for customer support is nothing somewhere like Detroit or Ann Arbor, but in Sanilac county a single family home can go for $80k which is totally affordable at that salary.

3. Zoning. I think the internet is making this a bigger deal than it actually is, but it's still a problem in many communities. High and medium density buildings can make sense in some places where they're currently not available as an option. Frankly, I think a major obstacle is the common requirement that some proportion of the units be made available to low income people. I know, I'm a monster, but if you dropped that requirement it would probably take away a lot of the stigma surrounding these construction projects.

Right now, when people hear "they want to build an apartment complex down the road from my house". We think of stairwells that reek of weed, overfilled dumpsters, cruddy car ports full of beat up cars, groups of teenagers hanging around in front of the buildings with no supervision, and garbage/clothing hanging off of balconies and blowing into the road. Start building some nice apartments at a middle class price point and over time that stigma will dissapate.

Anecdotally, existing apartments only enforce this stigma. If you open up the sex offender map for your town the local apartment complexes are lit up like a Christmas tree. They get a bad reputation that needs to be repaired and eventually you'll see some movement on it.
I think the answer would be a resounding “yes”.
Honestly I’d like to abolish landlording as we currently understand it as a whole.
FYI. I know a guy, one guy not a corporation that owns 256 houses in the Lansing area. What should we do with this guy? I mean kudos to him but he’s kinda part of the problem.
Where do i sign
Your perceptions are off base. Institutional buyers own 0.5% of single family homes and the dreaded Blackstone owns 0.06%.

Urban legends are strong. Here is a link to a blog posts and it provides citations.

Hi not from Michigan, but I’m a Real Estate Investor/Developer…. I have an elite M7 MBA and an economics degrees…. I understand the frustration of many when losing out on  the purchase of a property but trust me this will not have any positive impacts and likely make housing more expensive.   I’ll break down this into a few key points   Also “Corporations” is a term used often here but doesn’t actually reflect the players here which are usually investment funds or REITS 1) “Wall Street” is really good at corporate structure management and tax avoidance… when “Wall Street” purchases properties they don’t buy then as the corporation they buy them as controlled fully or partially entities trust, lllcs, Reits just to name a few. You create a carve out for mortgages or non profits etc Wall Street will find a way to exploit it to the extent that the ban won’t exists. 2) Most of those cash buyers are not corporations they are small time landlords or remote workers or something similar, sure “Wall Street” is buying a higher percentage than they use to of new homes but they still own something like 2% of units which is tiny. It is the small investors who are the big players here fat from PPC welfare.  3) As a infill developer I’ve learned that the general public really doesn’t comprehend the hurdles for building and time, it can take years for what should be simple things. If an investor can’t hold a property it will deter investment and new builds which will ultimately increase home prices, or you are going to have to create a big carve out again something that will be exploited. 

Instead of trying to create bands that will either won’t work or have horrible unforeseen consequences focus on removing the reason “Wall Street” wants to buy houses… which is the price will keep going up/they provide strong cash flow (when in desirable neighborhoods ). Why because there is usually strict zoning/density restrictions in the most in demand neighborhoods.  Fix this issue and you will stop “Wall Street” from buying.
Personally not for that, personally would like to tax people renting homes out, and use tax money to build housing. Basically making it worse to rent.
This will be litigated to death if it should pass, all the way up to the "Corporations are People" maggots at the corrupt and compromised Supreme Clown Court.

Jeff Bezos is one of the corporate maggots buying up single family homes to use as rentals. You think that slimy asshole will stand still for ordinary people cutting into his profits?

Hahahahahahaha. 

No.
You just described the entire legal world.
Indeed. It would take someone much wiser than I to devise the language in such a way as to NOT eventually be weaponized by the for-profit war machine
an incorporated entity cannot own property zoned for single family housing. full stop. You want to own an extra house (or several?) that's fine, but you have to personally accept the risks.
[deleted]
How about.     it’s illegal for corporations to own single family homes.  Perfect.   How could that be ripe for abuse?  I’m seriously asking?
Problem is how do you know which experts are being forthright on the issue and not speaking out of their wallets.
One off the top of my head is mortgages. If the bank can’t take ownership of your property, it’s not good collateral. Without mortgages most couldn’t ever afford to buy a house.
I work in healthcare, and there are organizations that purchase homes for use as group living environments for disabled residents, and people with higher support needs or for respite care. It’s pretty important that these services still exist in the community, not in a stuffy hospital, which requires corporate buying of residential homes.
Definitely a nuanced thing.
I think the trick is to make it very unprofitable to hold a multitude of houses rather than just banning it outright. Set up the tax structure so the taxes start rapidly skyrocketing as you add more and more houses to the point where companies are incentivized to keep the number as low as possible. 

The problem there as always is how do you keep companies from just spinning off other companies to isolate them legally from that tax structure. I could see that leading to some scenario where each rental house is its own corporate entity so the responsible 'company' only holds one house.

I assume that even landlords with a single rental property still establish LLCs to insulate themselves. If an LLC can't own a house, that's basically an end to house rentals. This proposal would drive up apartment rents significantly, as people who can't afford to buy houses are evicted from their rental houses and compete for the available apartments.
One that I'm thinking of is that LLCs provide limited liability which would disincentivize the creation or maintenance of new property.


In a housing shortage, any builder is good for helping with it (according to the research/literature). However rent-seekers and slumlords don't do anyone any favors.
Another issue is how such a policy impacts housing construction and allocation. Condos/co-ops are homes too, and a policy that makes them the only available target for residential companies may lead to them targeting just that, reducing supply for those that would otherwise prefer owning a condo over a detached house.

Maybe something that limits or progressively targets total owned residential square footage across the company/owners, but also ofc would want to see in depth info.

Alongside, there also just needs to be more housing in general in the places people want to be.
The present system is putting housing out of reach for  average working families. We cant change it because of some vague possibility of some undefined future harm to parties unknown? Bullshit.
Family offices cease to exist.
Also I’d worry that the big companies would push for loopholes that only work for big companies and hurt small LLCs / people who lived in a house for years only to move out and rent it out which is pretty common. They really aren’t the problem (they aren’t buying houses with cash for example) but in an effort to pass anything, I could see big companies throwing them under the bus.
Hear me out. Instead of a ban, make the taxes on it increase exponentially for each additional single family house owned. 

Include in the law what that tax money can be used for: housing the homeless, increased section 8 housing availability, whatever testing is required to change zoning requirements, down payment grants to people who qualify for FHA loans, etc.
But ironically, they are contributing to the problem by creating more demand for houses. Instead of competing against your fellow citizens now for houses, you're now competing against private companies.

Them being involved in the market raises prices, which is not good for us.
Our best shot at addressing these concerns are yes AND approaches, we should address both the symptoms (corporate ownership of homes) AND the root causes of undersupply at the same time.
Until you've had to deal with a zoning board that has archaic rules on the books, you haven't lived.

We lost out on a huge waterfront parcel that went to the Maroun family (ugh) because city council wouldn't convert heavy use industrial to single family.

And the State of Michigan was going to put in  a  boatload of brownfield reclamation money.

SMH
Exactly right. Fix the cause, not the symptoms.
Both measures are needed. They're 'investing' in houses because they can make more money off of us in the long run if they can force us to rent from them indefinitely rather than let us own our own homes. If we build more, they'll just keep buying them up. Rent will probably go down a little bit but the underlying problem won't be solved with that alone as long as companies are still allowed to own homes.
I mentioned earlier I used to work for a company that did exactly that. We always had someone out at that site and sometimes it would be for a day or two days or sometimes for months. It made more sense for them to have a smaller house financially and everyone loved actually getting to stay in a house instead of a shitty motel (there were no nearby hotels) for extended stays.

One employee did leave the house a complete mess (like spoiled food left out, damaged items/floors, smoked in the house, etc) once and the higher ups sent out an email saying that if it ever happens again, only senior management would be allowed to use the house and we're going back to the motel. Never seen someone become so universally hated at work and she ended up quitting a couple months later. Not that she got bullied or harassed at work, but she was always a very below standard employee and didn't last long once the microscope got turned on her and people stopped covering for her.

From what I was told is the next person using the house after her was one of our higher ups and he had brought his family with him on the trip and was going to go hunting and hiking on the weekends.
Properties or Units? Because if its 3 Units then that kills development of buildings and complexes. However if its properties as in land I can think of an outcome where you get massive sprawling complexes on one massive plot that would have consisted of either new land or merged former properties.

Idk anything with this would probably have to have extremely strict language and may backfire rather than help the current issue.
The only issue I would have with your solution would be if it prevented a parent from helping their disabled adult children secure housing. Many times in those cases, the parent has to be listed as owner/occupant even if they don’t live in the home. If they had more than two children, they’d need some sort of exception.
Piggy backing on this because my idea is similar- exponentially increasing property taxes on family housing. Buy as much as you want but there’s no way it’s worth it and if it is, all that money is going back to the community to build new homes or whatever
Ballot in initiatives can be nuanced.
I whole heartedly agree. However, I’m of the mind that they would never even attempt to talk about this. Between the obvious of money it’s also impossible to get them to agree on anything due to tribalism.
But then why have all the big things we’ve wanted we’ve had to do by petitioning for ballot? Even then they try to find ways to subvert what we put on the ballot. All the important things have only happened because of the sledge hammer.
Individual landlords can be a thing, but the hedge funds and "national management" companies need to get the boot.
Others have touched on this, but it would be a very nuanced situation. Housing is just messed up atm fir reasons that i don’t (as a layman) understand. I look a lot on zillow because im getting ready to shop and homes are literally 2-4x their value from a few years ago. Rent has rapidly increased. So I think its a challenge to address that problem as a whole and people are just trying to tackle one facet.
I'm of the same opinion as you. Does it sound great as a sound bite? Absolutely. 

Does it sound great when you start fleshing out how to pull it off? Nope. 

Corporations own executive housing. What's the limit? What's the size minimum and maximum? 

Does buying securities with mortgages bundled in get accidentally scooped up when it's written that a corporation can't be involved? 

Do big-time landlords stop existing, causing many to no longer have a place to rent? What about people with less than stellar credit? Big companies typically accept lower-credit applicants. More likely to accept Section 8, and/or can be forced to accept X number of low-cost rentals. Is Mom-n-Pop going to start being forced to rent out their property to someone they don't want to, credit-wise? Otherwise, where are those people going to go? 

Is it a problem? Absolutely. I'm just hesitant to see how it'd play out IRL.
Would requiring a corporation to offer COL adjusted wages to ALL renters satisfy your need to allow companies to own the housing they rent?
THIS!

and to add to it: SCOTUS has ruled time and time again in favor of corporate personhood. It is disgusting and terrible, but here we are.
Trusts are defined differently yes, but closing in a trust is different than closing with a company. It’s a slightly different process. I’m sure those could be carved out easily enough.
I’m thinking it would need to basically say “not offering for rent on the market or left vacant”. My concern is keeping them out of landlording. So like companies that offer housing to employees aren’t putting those houses up for rent on the market or leaving them vacant to influence the market.
Right! These are the types I’m mostly talking about. I just also want to lump in the people that buy dozens of houses and put them into an llc.
Learning my rights as a tenant has resulted in me getting more than my security deposit back twice after suing landlords.
[An estimated 40% of all single family rental homes](https://moguldom-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/moguldom.com/448718/metlife-institutional-investors-could-own-40-of-single-family-rental-homes-by-2030/amp/?amp_gsa=1&amp_js_v=a9&usqp=mq331AQIUAKwASCAAgM%3D#amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&aoh=17180459757617&csi=1&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fmoguldom.com%2F448718%2Fmetlife-institutional-investors-could-own-40-of-single-family-rental-homes-by-2030%2F) will be owned by investors by 2030. Where are you getting 4%?
Individuals can own rental homes. Lots do. They file on a schedule E and close on the property as an individual. Happens all the time. What are you talking about?
I think rentals are ok. I do not agree with short term rentals though. I think that is a big part of the issue.
Are you thinking of property managers? They don’t have to hold the deed and often don’t own the properties they manage.
My neighbor, who I rented from and then am now buying from isn't a corporation....
Did you put all of your houses into an llc? If you do what most do and just have a bunch of schedule E properties it wouldn’t apply to you. 

If you’re filling the houses on a schedule C or on a 1040s that would be what I’m talking about.
So you want to raise taxes on poorer renters so you can give tax breaks to wealthier homeowners?
So long story short none of what you’re saying would apply here. Trusts and placing a home into an llc are completely different. 

You would still be filing a schedule e if it were a rental. I’m discussing llc, scorp, and corp. unless you are filing a schedule c or a 1040s for a business this isn’t about what you’re talking about.
That’s why I suggested ballot initiative. It seems to be the only way our state gets things done.
How so? Did I miss the section on the rights of corporations and businesses? This is no different than any other financial regulations.

Why isn’t it a good idea? I don’t see a good outcome from hedge funds buying houses. What are you seeing that I’m not. What good comes from corporate landlords of single family residences? I’m not talking about apartments here, specifically houses. 

Do you have something constructive to add?
Not just increase but increase starter homes. It seems like everything is a condo or a 400k 4 bed 3 bath thing.
I was thinking specifically single family residence, and excluding trusts.
Frankly they could update the assessments on the houses that sold last in the 80s and 90s. Houses are currently very over priced and I think those people could start paying their fair share first.

Way too many people that pay $800 a year vs people that pay $1,200 a month.
And yet people shun VA and FHA loans which can only be used on a primary. That’s another soap box issue. Realtors talk people out of accepting VA loans on houses that are fine. As a vet, that’s one of my benefits, so I just assume those realtors hate America.
Yes, they currently own one percent and it’s rising. Large capital is just getting into this game. Thus Bloomberg saying it’s not a problem. Last thing they would want is us to prevent an issue.

Zillow is buying a lot of houses. They just started doing this in the last few years. It’s going to take a while for that % to go up, but it will.
Which 1% though, and geographically where?
That is not how a mortgage works. It’s more like your car. You own it, however there is a lien on it. 

A foreclosure would be a short term holding. I said long term.
You can also distinguish by who’s name is on the deed. Companies also must list all assets on taxes. It’s very different
A bad thing any way you choose to phrase it.
Yes as in hedge funds and zillow
The ones I knew rented, however drunk rich kids social clubs are not on my radar.
Zillow has been buying houses like crazy the last couple years. It’s already happening.
I would love that! I think ballot initiative is the only way it would happen though.
What? That isn’t how mortgages work. That’s a lien not ownership.
Or how much toxic waste you can dump in water either right?
They can lose that protection. If you want to be in charge of somebodies home, you can take the risks.
Banks only take short term ownership. Notice I said long term.
If I can offer you any advice, shop your mortgage. Check brokers that are smaller. You will save thousands! Also from the moment you have your credit pulled you have a window where any mortgage pulls count as one when scored. You’ll save thousands. Any terms offered without a credit pull are garbage.
That's such a bold stance.  Why do you *hate* people who make a living by improving and reselling things?
Totally agree on Airbnb. Saw lots of houses be bought just to be hotels.
I remember listening to to a story about people who owned multiple homes in New Orleans were going to be forced to sell. In bad areas, some people bought and restored the blighted house next to them in order contribute to the neighborhood but people like that got caught up in mess when the legislation wasn’t intended for them. They were trying to stop people who didn’t live in New Orleans from buying properties and renting them to clowns who left trash all over the neighborhoods and partied well into the night. Low income families who fixed up the condemned home next door outside of the tourist areas were labeled the same as a corporation that bought properties to rent out for Mardi Gras.
They are also buying faster than in the past. Why not both? Why let perfect prevent good and why not prevent a problem before it happens for once in human history?

Their intent is obvious, Zillow buys a lot of houses. A lot of homes are owned by seniors, I’m worried about ten years from now.
For what reason?
For that situation I like the increasing tax people talk about in here.
And much of the activity in the House and Senate
I grew up near Port Huron. I think the city put a limit on the percentage of houses that could be rentals a while back. The limit makes people sell to people because corporations have no interest in owning houses for anything other than rent. 

I'm sure there are issues with the way this would work in an area with tighter housing demand,  but it seems like a pretty elegant solution.
I understand and actually don't disagree with LLCs. It's pretty standard for a lot of valid reasons, but I won't split hairs. 

Think the LLCs should be limited to not be owned by another non-person entity, so we don't have this shell Corp chain that supports corporate ownership as investment vehicles. 

But single family homes in mixed zoning would definitely be annoying loop hole, and I think you'd see a lot of petitions to change zoning to mixed use
Isn't Zillow or some other giant Vanguard/Black rock backed corporate housing market/bank owned property vacuuming entity an LLC?
That house hanging on the side of a hill or at the beach, that will have a ton of downside price pressure.   You really think the billionaires are going to put up with that our of their paid off senators.
a big corporation can make a llc for every property they buy, it’s no that hard
So weird it so no llc can own residential property
Always a risk, of course, which is why a diverse set of opinions is needed for a complete picture.
you look for experts who have no incentive to lie. For this situation I would look for academic research by either Urban Planning experts or Economists. I think it's pretty unlikely they would approve this approach. There's so many obvious issues with it for example who is going to build apartment buildings? or How would we maintain a supply of rental properties?
Do they wear a red hat or not.. that’s the first indicator.
That could be one of the exceptions. And then a way to ensure it goes to an actual family is something like a company can't buy it until it's been on the market for years or something like that.
One possible solution to this, and OPs situation of companies buying houses to flip, is to make the law that corporations cannot own an occupied single family home. There’s probably still some edge cases there, but feels like a decent starting point.
OP did mention that companies could own houses, just not long term, businesses couldn't decide to maintain a foreclosed house to make a profit as a rental. A foreclosed house would be auctioned with a starting bid of the balance of the unpaid loan.
Yeah, that's a perfect example! The exact kind of system-destroying issue that undermines this whole idea, at least in this very simple form.
> One off the top of my head is mortgages. If the bank can’t take ownership of your property, it’s not good collateral. Without mortgages most couldn’t ever afford to buy a house.

A bank doesn't need "ownership" to force a sale and recover lost money. Short Sales exist.
Would that drive prices way down? If nobody could afford to buy a house without a mortgage at their current price, and mortgages became illegal, then what would happen when the old generations of homeowners die off?
You could spin off as many small entities as you want, it doesn’t matter, someone still owns those entities themselves. If a big corporation owns 1000 LLC’s that own one house per LLC the beneficial owner of the houses is still the one large corporation.  You just write the law that way so it recognizes that the corporation owns the houses in the eyes of the law just as if it owned them directly.
This is already pretty commonplace as a lot of lawyers will recommend a separate LLC for each property to isolate liability and prevent a claim at one property from putting another at risk.

So we end up with “123 Main LLC”, etc. even if one management company controls a bunch of properties, under the hood they are often all legally separate.
Thats a bingo.
This is me. I own a LLC and a house that we rent out. I’d support a cap on how many properties individuals can have partial ownership in OR a tax code that increases taxes depending on how many houses you have partial stakes in, including if you own an LLC which owns a house (which is what I have, but I only have 1). 

I do think the housing market would collapse with a blanket “no LLCs can own residential property”

Also would not prevent house flippers from buying with cash though, and I have a feeling that is a huge part of the problem.
Read some of the comments under mine and I guarantee you'll find groups of people you care about that would be badly affected by this.
This has been my wish for a while - not only single-family homes though. Same if you own 30 apartment complexes.

I’d be happy too if non-corporations get a small exemption, say you can own 3 personal homes. Some people have great utility from 2 homes, say in Michigan where they mostly live and in Texas where they live for work about 3 months throughout the year. And many people own a cabin (even if I don’t) and maybe that’s fine too. 

But the guy with 8 houses and the corporation with 2,000 can pay some taxes.
You’d have to create some mechanism to trace who the ultimate title holder is. It only costs like $100 to register a new LLC, so some conglomerate will create a bunch of shell corps so none of them hit your radar of massive titleholders.

The bitcoin stuff is BS, but I do think blockchain is going to be the answer to these issues in the future. When ledgers show where money ultimately flows, all the corruption, sweetheart deals, kickbacks, false fronts, tax havens and shell corps are going to be harder to hide.
Owned by what? Not to be rude but what is the determining factor of what an entity is?  Say I’m a corporation…. I put each of these homes into separate LLCs.  The LLCs now only own 1 home each therefor I avoid the ban…… or maybe I buy the property and put it into a trust which is controlled by a semi independent representative who administers the trust for the property with the corporation being the beneficially of the proceeds. Listen to mthlmw they have the right idea.
Michigan already doubles your property taxes if it isn't owner occupied.  How much more do you want?
The rent prices are artificially rising because these companies control so much of the market, and collude with themselves.
Not to mention when you compete against these massive banks, they're able to pay cash and have a seemingly endless budget, so they can outbid any other prospective buyers. Nothing good comes from this practice as it stands.
Like *the* Maroun family?
I’d counter with, don’t let perfect get in the way of good. Or, why not both.
If we fixed the cause of wealth inequality today, and not the symptoms, we would still have wealth inequality. Fixing the cause doesn't necessarily resolve the issue. You also have to mitigate the effects of the problem to resolve the issue. 
> If we build more, they'll just keep buying them up.

Corporations that invest in housing brag to their investors that they target areas with restrictions on new housing supply, and admit in their SEC filings that a boom in housing construction would be a serious threat to their ability to price gouge.

On the other side of things, Tokyo doesn't have any laws against corporations buying housing, but it does have very pro-housing zoning laws, and median housing costs haven't gone up in 20 years.

And in case you're thinking US "exceptionalism" means it can't work here, Austin doesn't have any laws against corporations buying housing, but last year its rental stock increased 8% and its rents started falling.

All this to say, corporations buy up all the new housing *because* new housing is so heavily restricted; if it weren't, they wouldn't.
Yeah, it would need someone versed in real estate law to word it. My basic idea would aim to be only applicable to single residential plots but maybe would need restrictions on merging plots, which I believe is up to cities right now.
So no more than 3 residential properties that can be rented for profit? Because it's more than just companies- individuals are buying up properties up north and using them ONLY as air b&b- type rentals which is also taking housing off the market. My inlaws small town is suffering from this. The older retirees die and the houses are being bought as investments and are no longer residential homes.
Do you have an example of one?
Local politicians are more accessible. Give it a shot
Because "blocking all corporate ownership of homes" isn't practical.  It needs thoughtful legislation applied.  This isn't a problem that can be solved by a solution that fits on a bumper sticker.
2-4x in a few years refers to which MI market?  I've paid over 5x what a prior owner paid for a rental property 9 years prior and it was still a good deal.
That's 40% of rental family homes, which is a small portion of total family homes. The 2022 U.S. census seems to suggest that the number of people renting single family homes is 1.3% ([source](https://arbor.com/blog/the-size-and-scope-of-the-single-family-rental-sector/#:~:text=Perhaps%20surprisingly%2C%20the%20number%20of,31.5%25%20of%20all%20rental%20households.)), even less than what the above comment states.
I always assumed landlords incorporated for tax reasons even if it was just for one or two houses but no it looks like the vast, vast majority of houses are not corporate owned
I'm gonna upvote you for sheer pigheadedness. Cheers.
Please reconcile sentences 2 & 4.

"...placing a home into an llc are completely different"

"I'm discussing llc..."

Literally every scenario I described applies.
I would be all for it, as long as it does not impact the regular citizen.
That's one way, but again that's endangering it passing.  You're hurting home values and increasing taxes on homeowners.  MI has one of the highest percentages of homeowners in the country and you need the support of a bunch of them to pass a ballot initiative.

If it gets on the ballot, there's going to be a lot of money directed towards it failing.  There needs to be a way to solve the tax problem without giving the anti-ballot folks easy ammo.
> And yet people shun VA and FHA loans which can only be used on a primary.

Because they take longer to get to the closing table and can often require the seller to jump through more hoops than a conventional loan.  I can't blame sellers for passing on them or realtors advising their clients to do so.  It sucks for people trying to use those loan types though, I get it.
Exactly my point it needs to be stopped it's economic disaster I'm agreeing it needs to stop.
I mean realistically. Flipping and selling is similar. But that goes down to city level. Flippers will often put the cheapest, shittiest vinyl over wood floors, paint, and tag 40+ on to the price. 

But buying even a 100 homes is nothing compared to corporations buying blocks
Agreed. Get something started
Default on loan means transfer of ownership. So yes it's basically exactly how it works.
How are waste regulation and company assets even close to the same?
They're doing it faster because home prices are appreciating so much faster than other assets. Historically home prices have increased a bit faster than inflation, but in todays market they are appreciating faster than other traditional assets. As a company if you had $400k in money floating around in your bank account, would you rather buy $400k in Tesla stock or a $400k house in an up-and-coming neighborhood? Which do you think will be worth more in 10 years? Which is going to generate better cash flow while you hold it?

I think that corporations have legitimate reasons for buying houses not related to speculation or investments. I think banning that would do more damage than what is currently being done.

We need to address the fundamentals of WHY the housing market is so lopsided or we'll keep having different flavors of the same problem over and over again.
It’s predatory and doesn’t benefit normal working people
[deleted]
you bring up a valid point with zoning. ultimately the best way to bring down the pricing of housing is increasing supply. that could definitely happen through building more because it's easier (via zoning/grants)
[deleted]
Disagree, only my opinion is needed.

Everyone else's just makes things complicated and confusing.
This is an accurate statement, but also not how the majority of voters absorb information. The moment something like this would come on the ballot would be the moment that big players get misinformation out there to crush it. 

That said, we shouldn't be enacting laws that limit the rights of others (even "evil" companies) without alot of care, thought, and due process. So i guess you just roll the dice and hope the voters can see through bull in one direction or another(doubt it)
Men in Hats, always a cautionary tale follows
[deleted]
Sounds like a great way to get a bunch of people kicked out of their rental SFH while a corporation uses it as a purely speculative asset.
Yeah, and I'd also include wording to eliminate or greatly reduce flipping as that is another barrier to affordable home ownership. Flippers come in and are able to quickly plunk down cash on any kind of "fixer upper" or basic starter home. They dress up the pig as quickly and cheaply as they can and suddenly, it's not as affordable as it was a few months ago.
That would still make mortgages more risky. Having to jump through hoops to offload a property would mean higher interest rates to reflect the risk. Corporate owners can fill a market niche when there is oversupply. It’s better to have 3 homes in a neighborhood owned by private equity and rented out than to sit empty and on a bank’s balance sheet.
Oh they’d collapse in value, and considering that aside from the rich, most middle (and more lower than you might think) class people have almost all of their wealth in their homes. And moving to cash up front, would prob cause values to go down to say 20% of their current values (the traditional down payment). So just like that the wealth owned by the lowest 90% would plummet considerably. 

Plummeting housing values would also lead to making it a bad decision financially to make repairs or improvements when it could just be cheaper to buy another house. Considering how much major repairs cost, when a house needed say a new roof ($15k-20k) the chances of the owner just abandoning any house worth less than $200k currently would skyrocket (you don’t sink $20k in to a house you could only get $10k out of.) So the affordable housing stock would deteriorate within 10-20 years. 

Current home owners would likely hold on to their homes as long as they could. Why? Current home owners only lose the money when they sell, but the home still has value to the owner and is harder to get for the average person; that’s a receipt for holding on to something for a long time. (Like my mom and her Bennie Babies when the market crashed, cause why don’t keep them just in case the value somehow comes back.) When they die they’ll leave their homes to their heir(s). So then only people whose parents (or someone else) leave them a house would own one. Some sort of house trading system might develop between existing home owners, but if you don’t have a house to trade in the first place, it’s going to be hard to get one.
I like the idea of taxes on this going toward the construction of new homes.
Okay now pretend your a developer who wants to build a large affordable housing complex… but this new law passes so each additional owned gets extra taxes… thus Corporations now don’t want to own apartment buildings in Michigan any more…. Therefore there is no one to buy my apartment building when I’m done…. So I’m definitely not going to build it. 

Congrats you did it!!! You stopped   All future apartment building in Michigan. You are the worlds top NIMBY!!
Add in punitive measures for abusing LLC to bypass the limitation including immediate liquidation of all assets held by the abusing entity. Easy. Next question.
If that were enough to prevent excessive purchasing of investment homes, it would have already.
How much of the market do companies control?
Rent is cheaper than owning atm. Rent has almost never been cheaper in regards to purchasing power.
Yes. Those fucks are storing vehicles on the site. We could have had a beautiful marina and single family housing.
Because dealing with the logistics of forcing companies to sell their property, and the massive legal challenges that are guaranteed to come out of that, isn't worth the effort when there's much better options to put your political activism towards.
An easy way to fix the air b&b stuff is each county designating a specific zone for them. If you're caught using it for that outside the specified zone, your property taxes double, second time you're caught they double again, third time the house is foreclosed upon by the county it's in and sold to a verifiable resident.
That’s an answer to a question that I didn’t ask. And those “bumper stickers” changed laws done by the people because thoughtful legislation was NOT happening, therefore the sledge hammer.
The amount of people that rent single family homes is not the same thing as the amount of single family homes owned by investors. If both of these are true it'd suggest investors own a lot of vacant housing.
Right, it’s a rising trend is my concern. It’s not a problem today but I think will be tomorrow. Large scale hedge funds and investors are starting to buy houses and get in the landlord game at a faster clip than before.
Between us home values also need to fall. 2% rates, a glut of buyers, and realtors hyper inflated houses over Covid. They are over valued. This is why I told all my clients paying over appraised value is stupid. I remember 2008.
They really don’t. Unless the house has issues. I’ve closed both in under two weeks regularly.
I was just commenting on the waiting to happen. Totally agree
Which would fall under short term holding and not long term.
It seems like any city council that actually cares about the people would do well to adopt such a policy. The only way corporations could beat these laws would be to have state governments outlaw them. This strategy has been used by Republicans to prevent local governments from adopting higher minimum  wages and by Democrats to prevent local governments from banning books from libraries.
I own a LLC and a house that we rent out and I’d support a cap on how many properties individuals can have partial ownership in. 

Like we have 1 house and no plans to expand. It was a smart financial decision for us. We bought a house in 2020, lived in it for a few years, then bought our dream house down the street. It did not make sense to sell when our interest rate was so low and we’re handy people able to keep up with our old home because we live so close. We rent to a wonderful couple with 2 giant pit bulls at well below the market rate, and have a feeling they are saving up for a house in a few years. 

We are not buying houses in mass and we sure as shit don’t have the capital to buy houses with cash. In fact we lost out to a lot of great houses from cash offers. 

I do think the housing market would collapse with a blanket “no LLCs can own residential property” but a cap on how many homes an individual can have partial ownership in that is super high then gets lower over time would prevent “professional landlords” from buying up houses with cash. 

It would not prevent house flippers from buying with cash though, and I have a feeling that is a huge part of the problem.
I totally agree….except with my opinion and not yours. Lol.
Totally agree, we only need this guy's opinion. Then we know exactly what's wrong and do the opposite.
Those rules are enforced by the mortgage company, not the legal system. They can call the loan back immediately if they find someone lied about it being a primary residence when it isn’t

That said, if they’re getting paid, they’re unlikely to make a fuss since they may not find it worth the cost to investigate for fraud
New property tax rate for vacant, corporate owned residential property? Double the non-homestead tax rate is a good place to start.
Wouldn't vacant homes with cheap starting bids drive prices down for new prospective owners? 

I'm wondering why it's better for three homes of people to make a massive conglomerate richer rather than keeping prices manageable for new homeowners? 

This is the problem with the growth mentality in markets like shelter, healthcare, and education. Folks get priced out. Corporations buy up the vacant homes and drive the price up by creating a false scarcity.
That's the punishment. The harder question is: How do you identify them?

These things are infuriatingly tricky to pull apart. It's why the IRS has straight up said they can't properly audit large investors with complex holdings. 

Do you require real estate LLC's to disclose all employee's entire contact lists, so you can 6-degrees of Kevin Bacon, and show that the Principal of the LLC is the college roommate of the accountant at BigCorp? How do you know there's any malfeasance in that relationship? The connection is in some angel investing seed money 5 layers deep.

  
Answer that one.
It’s not abuse it’s literally how the  laws are set up although they can be abused what you are discussing as abuse is by design both at federal and state level. These structures exists to allow innovation and risk taking in our economy, obviously you can attempt to reform them but recognize that may require federal and other state participation in terms of requirements.
Then talk with your local municipalities and counties.  They're the ones who set the majority of the property taxes, not the state.
Something like 600,000 out of 90,000,000 total single family homes (0.6%) in the US as of mid-2022. (Source in my comment above)
Depends if you’re chained to a low interest rate or not, I think. I can’t afford to move right now just based on the bath I’d take on the interest.
Haha. Sorry you got boned but they 99.9% bribed someone.
Or beautiful multi family housing
You know the worst part is they only started doing that to try to prevent the Gordie-Howe bridge from being built. They were trying to get all the Detroit-side land where you could build the bridge, refuse to sell, and set themselves up to drag out an eminent domain lawsuit as long as possible.
I find it more realistic that we could prevent private companies from buying single family homes than if we built more housing.

PS; Isn't Michigan losing population? Shouldn't we not have to be building as many houses?
It is absolutely a problem today and is the primary factor in rising rental costs. That and the usage of property management groups, which then lump the remaining individuals into a corporation of their own.
Two weeks from offer to closing is wildly outside the norm for any sort of mortgage.

And not everyone knows ahead of time if there house might have issues, so as a seller it's best to play it safe unless the VA/FHA offer is better.
Which is how we get hot potato mortgage trading. Still will effect mortgage rates, and what and who would be willing to finance homes. 

Don't see this working out.
A great portion of the problem is the year over year gains of just holding onto a empty house have been 5% since 2019 for a ton of zip codes.   Without 10% unemployment spike, without a big black swam event, how does anyone expect the traditional zestimate high water mark seller to enter into a new psychology.        
  
Let the gains stop dead cold for 3 years and there will be downward pressure on the price.   Let someone talk about how hard it is to find a buyer for more than 5 minutes.     Now if you go around yelling that housing is in short supply because of long term holders,  your going to give the market enough of push for another 4 years of gains.
I propose a sign up sheet where everyone picks a subject to have THE opinion on. It's going to have to be first come first serve.  Opening any slots to challengers is going to be too complicated. And the popular subjects would face endless challengers.

If the subject you want is already taken, you can choose a new subject or choose or get more granular.  For example, if someone has already decided that baseball sucks, you could add:  though baseball has been established to be a less desirable activity than others, one of the bright spots of the game was the various trivia and mini games that would take place on the scoreboard at professional games.
From the bank, who took ownership after mortgage defaults, selling those 3 homes to...anyone at all, is better than them sitting there.  That was the other person's point.  Mortgages would get more expensive reflecting that increased risk.
I own an LLC for a house I lived in and now rent out. The income (a whopping $700 last year) I had to pay taxes on. The IRS knows who owns what LLCs because any income or lack of income becomes part of their tax return. The LLC is set up as a rental real estate. I don’t think it’s be too hard to scale increasing taxes on people hoarding single family homes for income.
I actually don't think property taxes will fix this at all, lol. It's not a good lever to pull on, because landlords usually just forward that cost to renters.
That is .6% too high.
How are they artificially raising if it’s cheaper than mortgages?
> PS; Isn't Michigan losing population? Shouldn't we not have to be building as many houses?

Most houses are not in the correct location
Not really, Michigan just isn't growing as fast as some other areas. 2020 Census reported 2.0% growth from 2010.
Start going to brokers, generally a conventional can be done in 10 days as long as the appraiser is quick. Seriously, I’m not exaggerating.
Let me get this straight. 

Home prices rise when homes get gobbled by corporations due to false scarcity 

At the same time, home prices rise when homes are vacant. 

Is there any situation where housing prices fall. Otherwise the whole system is a giant fucking scam.
Right, but I'm going to assume you're in the 98% (along with me) who aren't SEC accredited investors? That you aren't operating under a financial instrument like self-directed IRA? And most importantly, that you aren't trying to hide anything.

More money is raised through private than public equity now; that's been the case since 2009. Private equity can layer LLC's and holding companies in ways that make it incredibly difficult to trace the parent corp. Developers often create project LLC's with a small group of investors, so it's not as simple as searching a nationwide register of deeds for a particular name, and taxing those with X number of properties. [https://www.morganstanley.com/im/publication/insights/articles/articles\_publictoprivateequityintheusalongtermlook\_us.pdf?1718127437340](https://www.morganstanley.com/im/publication/insights/articles/articles_publictoprivateequityintheusalongtermlook_us.pdf?1718127437340)

And there are structures, like self-directed IRA's, that don't have the same federal income tax reporting requirements as your LLC. The SDIRA is held by a trust company, and all they do is keep a ledger of money in/out. Only the taxable distributions would show up as income in a person's tax return, but the real estate holdings may not be held under that name.

Here's a good article on it - if you'll jump down to the "Example 2"

[https://www.journalofaccountancy.com/issues/2013/oct/20137626.html](https://www.journalofaccountancy.com/issues/2013/oct/20137626.html)

All I'm saying is that we'd need more advanced financial monitoring tools to enforce; the big investors have tools that are out of reach for most of us. And since they'd be biting off the hand that feeds them, there's no political appetite for it.
Some companies just got prosecuted and fined for this elsewhere, just recently. They buy up the housing stock, and rent it out, raising all the rents across the area. There’s some sort of consulting software involved that was part of the manipulation. I’m not an expert, just been watching the market since I want to move…

Here’s one:

https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2024/jun/05/fbi-raids-atlanta-corporate-landlord-tfp/
What, Detroit? Everyone complains on here how there’s no houses that are affordable yada yada, but they all want to live in Grand Rapids and Ann Arbor, Brighton, or Novi. Nobody says Detroit or Flint for being progressive as they claim they are.
For a 2% population growth, I definitely think there is a lot of other factors in mind other than "not enough houses" when we are seeing Michigan home prices rise with nationwide trends.
I'm not saying you're lying or exaggerating, but your experience is far outside the norm and people shouldn't expect it to be the case.  The average time to close on a conventional mortgage is ~45 days and FHA/VA loans average a couple days longer than that.
This is so disingenuous, why are you comparing apartment rental prices to mortgages / sfh rental prices?
right, and they bring up how there are supposedly all these empty houses as a reason why we don't need to build more even though they'd never live in those empty houses themselves, because again, wrong location.
Part of it is also where people want housing and what is available. Houses in places like Lowell, Holt, and Howell are comparably quite affordable, but they aren’t necessarily where people want to live. That’s why the density thing is such an issue.
Eh not really, 2% over time will add up and housing has been stagnating. We're seeing the result of something that should have been dealt with 20-30 years ago
Where??? I’ve worked at quicken, loandepot, uwm, and independent brokers. The only people that slow and terrible at it are banks/credit unions.
It's rather hilarious. Everyone is a progressive until they actually have to face the reality of their ideas in places like Flint, Saginaw, Detroit, etc.
That's a national average.  You can see data [here](https://www.moneygeek.com/mortgage/analysis/average-time-to-close-on-a-house/).  

Are you maybe using a different metric or something?  When we sold our last house it took us about 30 days to get from offer to closing table and that was using a mortgage broker and we were extremely responsive on everything they needed.

The buyers of our old house waived inspection and were able to get appraisal waived due to putting 50% down and it still took them something like 18-19 days to get from offer to closing and our realtor told us that's one of the fastest she's ever seen where a mortgage was involved.

I feel like we must be talking apples and oranges here somewhere because 10 days is so ridiculously at odds with both my own experience and research done on the topic.
They could just agree that we need to build more housing just about everywhere. The exclusivity of the more desirable areas is what helps get people stuck in the less desirable areas. That, and the car dependent sprawl that comes with those areas is what contributes to a lack of alternative transportation due to low density
No we aren’t. Some are faster than others but yeah a clean w2 employee type and I can guarantee clear to close in initial underwrite. If the loan officer knows what they are doing, it’s not hard to close that fast at all. Just use brokers. 

There’s a couple waiting periods that are written in, so many days after cd etc. I’m not selling anybody so I’ll leave it as vague as use a broker. 

I’ve closed hundreds of loans in 21 states and worked as a loan officer for a decade.  In my experience it goes in order…

Broker bad at their job: never
Banks/credit unions: 45+ days
Retail (rocket, loandepot, veterans united: 30 days
Broker: 14 days (my fastest was 11 on a purchase and 5 on a refinance)

Brokers are also usually way cheaper. I can’t recommend them enough having worked at all three of the top three lenders and going broker.
My fellow Michiganders, PLEASE stop merging onto the highway at 55, you're going to get us both killed.
I swear to Christ, every time I try to merge onto the highway I'm stuck behind some chucklefuck just strolling into the highway well below highway speed. That big lane in front of you? That's for you to get up to speed, you don't have to merge at 55 and immediately cut into the middle lane without indicating.
"45 it is then!" -drivers near me.
This drives me insane. I feel like getting a drivers license should be more difficult based on what I see on a daily basis.
Christ, people tryign to get on the highway going *45* have me seeing jesus in my future. If you're too scared to merge at speed, please just avoid the highway. Its safer that way.
I grew up in Michigan, I was taught by my parents and my driver's ed teacher; the on ramp is the acceleration lane, get up to speed of traffic on the freeway/highway then merge. Damn idiots here (California) do the same as you're talking about.
When I lived in Jacksonville, FL, people literally stopped at the end of the expressway entrance ramp and then try to merge starting at zero mph. I think there were even stop signs at the end of the ramps. It was a dumb and most unsafe system.
And while we are at it, you don't brake and then get into the turn lane. Get out of the way and then brake.
In Atlanta it infuriates me that people will literally *stop* at the freeway entrance to wait for an in instead of getting up to speed to merge.
Wait until the first snow and everyone has forgotten since last winter how to handle it apparently.  People in this state are literally some of the worst drivers I have ever encountered and I’ve been to most states.
It’s called an acceleration lane for a reason.
People need to have a chat with their family members. There are a lot of old people now that need to be told they should not be driving anymore.
Merging onto I75 south at M59 is pretty much a nightmare due to the need to put your foot to the floor to get up to speed. Plus cars are crossing paths to enter and exit. Sometimes it’s simply a lack of horsepower that causes problems. I have two vehicles and one happens to be an old Ford Ranger with a 4 cylinder. Even when to the floor it’s slower than hell. I’m shocked there aren’t more problems at the junction, but it’s been around a while so I guess people have learned the routine. It’s actually pretty cool seeing the coordination sometimes, until it’s not due to someone new or inattentive.
My favorite is when they merge, and then immediately head to the left lane and go 60mph. People are just clueless.
Also, the left lane is the passing line. Gtfo unless you’re going faster than everyone else!!!
I know this is a general thing but guessing some PTSD from southbound US 131 to 96 east merger. Butt clench time.

I certainly don't have that at all...
It's infuriating when I'm driving a 30 year old 4 cylinder economy car and the guy in front of me does this. I literally need all the ramp I can get to speed up
These are the same people that start to decelerate at the 1 Mile marker before their exit.
I don’t get it. Then they speed up after
That. And when someone moves over to give you room to get on, don't accelerate to match their speed so the person that let you in can't move back over into the right lane.
Make me cry how close to my heart this is. It’s either that or some dude going 97 w no signal fitting himself in spaces that don’t exist. I hear you!!!!
Back in 1971 drivers ed, we were taught-  MERGE AT SPEED! The “on ramp” was called the acceleration ramp. So you could MERGE AT SPEED
[deleted]
I leave a gap behind them and then accelerate before fully getting on and pass their ass. It does feel so dangerous that I feel the need to be more dangerous to leave the danger.
496 in lansing is a total shitshow. Getting onto eastbound 496 is extra special around Capitol Ave. People are trying to get off the freeway to surface streets at the same time people are trying to merge onto 496. There are times you can't get up to freeway speed thanks to the structure of that scenario. 

I would much rather get into 696. Traffic flows well, even during rush hour. I won't die of cancer or a cardiovascular event. I will be killed on 496.
People driving like they're the only ones on the fucking road kill me. Mother fuckers lately act like if they're ok, it don't matter what happens to any one else. And for the fucking love of God, if you're afraid of going over 65/70 stay off the fucking highways. Michigan Ave will take you east and west, and telegraph/24 will take you north and south. Please stay of 275,75, 96, 94, etc at least until construction is done. The amount of scared drivers is unsettling. And you can tell they're scared cuz they're holding the wheel with both hands, their knuckles are white, and they won't turn their heads from the road infront of them. 

I drive like 400 miles a day, and the amount of fucking inconsiderate and just bad driving I've seen in the past 4-5 years has been incredible. And in the past year, like since last summer, I don't know what the fuck happened, but it's gotten even worse. 

I've had 2 friends die in the past 4 months, in accidents that weren't their faults. 100% on the other driver. 1 time the other driver was on their phone and doing 60+mph in a 35 on Michigan Ave and hit her car. The other was hit by a lady running a red light. I've literally watched, with my own eyes, 6 people die since January this year in car accidents. Im talking about shit that happened in front of me. The accidents that are happening make no fucking sense. Just people not obeying simple fucking rules of the road, or not paying attention, or hesitating cuz they're scared.

Driving is really fucking easy. Id argue its easier than walking. And yet some of y'all complicate the fuck out of it. Jus pay attention, and keep in mind others driving, depends on your driving

You gotta keep in mind your pushing 5,000 lbs, 50+ mph, you hit ANYTHING, and lives are changing.
Just give them a chance to get in the left lane and go 55...
I especially hate it when it’s a double use merge for both exiting a highway and entering. Whoever the fuck thought those were a good idea when designing them should be in jail. As soon as a driver sees it’s clear to merge onto the highway they should be gas pedal to the floor. But nope. Semi-truck exiting 75 with their blinker on? Let’s just match their speed and fuck anyone behind me. The drivers who can’t consider what everyone else around them also needs to do are the absolute worst.
Every state has its own quirks about driving; merging is 100% Michigan’s thing. I’ll have a 1/4 mile of open lane in front and a 1/4 mile behind and I’ll have someone get one and ride right beside me in the merge lane waiting for me to let them in. And then to make it interesting you have these really F’ed up on ramps like Jackson Rd to 94E where you have like 300’ to go from 15mph to 70mph and merge. Or Barton Dr where you are basically asked to make a right turn into freeway traffic…
I’m a New Yorker who moved here 3.5 years ago. I’m here to let you know that it is OK to use the horn on these fuckers. Y’all do not use the horn enough out here. These slow idiots are going to cause more accidents.
Also what is with all of the fake student driver stickers?
the flip side of it, is that acceleration lanes can be pretty short at times 

yesterday I saw a car at a dead stop at the end of the acceleration lane because traffic didn't let them in. Now you're 1,000% more fucked than coming in at 60 and then punching it to 80 to make the opening
And then they act surprised when you blow by then angrily doing the fucking speed limit.
A lot of defensive chucklefucks in here.
Turned on to an on ramp yesterday and half way down the guy in front of me puts on his turn signal and starts breaking.  We got on the highway at about 35mph.
Drivers being overly courteous are dangerous. I almost T-boned somebody the other day because they turned left in front of me after making eye contact and an agreement with the person in the lane immediately next to them. They just went ahead and turned across two lanes without even thinking about what was in the lane that they hadn't made an agreement with somebody in.

Things like this have happened to me dozens of times over the last few years as a professional driver. I know y'all think you're being courteous to your neighbors, but the rest of us are following traffic laws. When you make an exception for somebody like that, you have just as much chance of causing an accident as you do of making somebody's day a little better.
When a vehicle is merging onto the highway and you’re driving in the right lane, it’s courteous and safer to move into the lane to your left if there’s space available. Once the merging vehicle has safely entered, and it’s clear, return to the right lane.

If you’re already in the lane next to the right lane, and another car is in the right lane while a vehicle is merging onto the highway, allow the car in the right lane to merge until it’s safe for them to return to the right lane.
Also, stop slowing down for merging traffic. Get over if you can, but maintain your speed. It's the responsibility of the merging vehicle to find their way in.
This makes me happy that I live in the middle of nowhere and don’t have to deal with this often.

Also, I like chucklefuck. I will be stealing that.
I once read, that ramp is there for you to *get up to speed to safely merge*. That is your job as the driver, match the highway speed.
Are *some people*a$$holes? Yeah. But that's not what this post is about.
What the f is up with this lately??? Did everyone forget during the pandemic?
This is a huge pet peeve of mine. The on-ramps in Michigan are so long compared to other states. Ffs get up to highway speed before merging!
Grand Rapids has several access points to and from 131. North of town, both the on and off ramps northbound and southbound start and end with long deceleration or acceleration lanes.

South of 196, however, the on ramps and off ramps are just a few hundred feet. Wealthy Street's ramps are steep and short. If you're not familiar with them, they can be terrifying. Like, the northbound off ramp at Wealthy comes off the LEFT lane on a 45-degree angle. Thus is also where the infamous S-curve begins.

I merge onto 131 south from MLK Street on a ramp that's less than half a city block on my way to work.

On my way home, I take north 131 to east 196, in the middle of downtown. The knuckleheads who designed the off ramp thought it would be a good idea to make the exit ALSO the on ramp from Pearl Street to north 131. Yes, that means you have cars speeding up and cars slowing down and sharing the same stretch of pavement. You have seconds to determine if you or the other driver goes first. Also, the off/on exit marks the end of this particular northbound lane. If you miss the off ramp, you have seconds to merge before you run out of road.

But we're not done. Exiting north 131 to east 196 now means you have a steep downward right-hand curve that turns into an on-ramp. You have four lanes crossing the bridge over the Grand River. The far right lane is the on-ramp that suddenly becomes the EXIT ONLY off ramp to Ottawa Avenue. You have seconds to merge. The next lane to the left is a main traffic lane. The next lane is a main traffic lane. The far left lane is the on-ramp from south 131. It has a double white line - you are not allowed to merge until you cross the bridge. It becomes the third main traffic lane after the Ottawa exit.

STILL, people getting off south 131 who want to go to Ottawa will illegally cross the double white line, shoot across all lanes, and enter the 131 on-ramp/Ottawa off-ramp, cutting off cars and nearly sideswiping others to get to Ottawa. It nearly happened to me with a semi who wanted to reach the Ottawa exit from the south 131 off ramp while I was using the on-ramp to east 196. 

Only the strong survive here.
Pretty sure the law says “…you’re not to disrupt the flow of traffic.”
The posted speed limit is the maximum we are supposed to be going.  The law states that you can go 10 miles per hour slower, however, if the traffic is going 65, then everyone should be going 65.
The people that don’t know how to merge must be awful at a roundabout.
Some cars don’t accelerate that well. 55 is an acceptable speed on the highway. If this is creating a dangerous situation for you, you are driving too fast
I know you probably picked an arbitrary number and that speed annoys me too, however 55 is freeway speed. It is the designated minimum speed limit.
I drive a Scion xB and the best I can do is 60 and I’m pushing it.
Some on ramps are curved enough that you have to take them at 35. no way to get up to speed fully before merging.
Some vehicles don't accelerate fast enough and some on ramps aren't long enough. 

I'm looking at you 275. I almost got ran off multiple times because I couldn't get my shitty manual Wrangler up to speed fast enough.

Also, unless there's an exit you need to use right by the entrance ramp, just get over.
I will take the 55 people instead of all the assholes doing 90+ and weaving around with no signals.
Amen.
The speed limit isn't a minimum. 55 is the minimum. Get over yourselves. Your speed is your responsibility.

they hand out a drivers license with every lobotomy now days.
Chucklefuck just became my new favorite insult!
They were never properly taught how to drive and merge. Totally unsafe.
I unfortunately moved to Cincinnati and holy shit no one down here merges at anything above 50. I frequently cross the white line and gun it to avoid being smashed to bits by a semi. They also drive about 60 in the left lane and take it very personally if you pass them.
Preach!!!
I'll never forget the old person I was behind merging onto 696 who STOPPED at the bottom of the entrance ramp. I was lucky I didn't get rear ended. Also been getting stuck behind plenty of people recently going 40 on entrance ramps too. My car doesn't accelerate super fast so I kind of need that space, thanks asshole. It's even more fun when there's a semi in the right lane that you could have merged in front of just fine if the idiot in front of you was going an appropriate speed.
I’ve gotten to the point of just laying on my horn. I’ve had enough.
Please stop thinking that the closer to my bumper you can force your way in.
The breakdown lane can be used as a extension of the merge lane when you jump out from behind me and force two lanes of traffic to suddenly slow down. 
At 55 when my gap gets here I can match speed pretty easily. Why do you think you have to shoe horn in too.
Zipper merge find your own gap.
And stop thinking you have no where else to go. Coming through get out of my way. 
I hope they put one of those red green lights at the end of the ramp you use everyday.
I pull a travel trailer on the weekends and I probably say “what the fuck” at least 20 times a trip because of idiots not knowing how to merge.
I hope people read this and truly consider. I drive a lot and too many people die on the road everyday. Take driving seriously. We all need to make it home.
There are entrance ramps that are so short that you can't make it up to 40!
Southfield Freeway on-ramps are one of the few exceptions to this rule. Those on/off ramps are all of 300ft max, there is barely any sporty cars that can hit 60mph in that space. Flooring it in any of my cars and I still struggle. That one, I give a pass for. I will be extra courteous around those short ramps but otherwise, we get plenty of time to merge.

 I was taught it is the merging party's responsibility to get up to speed and find a way in, it is my job in the Right Lane to keep a steady, consistent speed to make it easy to merge around me. I don't get out of your way, that makes me a variable and I've just increased the risk of an accident. It's *your* move, player
literally everyone on Southfield near Allen Park. JUST GO!
This reddit post just fixed the problem, thank you.
yes!! merging on 75 from big beaver, because that lane is being worked on, people go so SO slow and i’ve almost been hit a couple times trying to merge on 75 but the person in front of me was doing 38
God help you if you’re on 94 through Grosse Pointe.

Everyone just yells “WITNESS MEEEEEEEE” and blindly merges into traffic without looking.
These are likely the same people that have been damn near blocking the 696/275 interchange during construction since they can’t bother to be in the correct lane until the last possible moment… like there’s only a half dozen signs west of orchard lake that one lane goes in either direction, you have miles to get situated…
It’s almost always the elderly. A lot of the time there’s literally a 40 - 50 mph road that runs parallel to the highway they’re scared to drive fast on.
I have little car with little engine. Some on ramps are small and I don't have enough power to get to 70 in a short 1/4 mile... Without redlining it. 

I try my best usually I'm at 60+ before I'm on the highway depending.
maybe just go the speed limits
mostly agree, but wanted to note that there are on ramps (on I-94 in ann arbor, for instance) that are so tightly coiled that it's impossible to reach a highway speed until you're on the straightaway. in these cases it's a design, rather than a user, issue
Some cars don't accelerate fast enough. My 2005 ranger just manages to hit 60 when I merge but people always speed up or switch lanes anyways. However there are some people that do choose to just go ridiculously slow for no reason.
Literally just had this happen to me, I was towing my boat and this hippo merges ahead of me onto a 65mph highway going 45 and then just stays there. Road's kind of curvy but more than safe to go 65. A few miles down the road after I get around her she comes passing me. I'm doing 70, she's easily doing 80. Road's straight. 

It's a skill thing. It's far too easy to obtain a driver's license. Don't even get me started on blasting through stop signs and  getting mad like "I was gonna stop before I hit you" or just as bad the "you go" "no you go" bullshit. It's all RIGHT of way. 

I can say for sure this is a Midwest thing. 

I don't follow people onto on ramps here. I'll putz along until they're into traffic and then accelerate and merge to correctly match the flow of traffic.
Hahaha *chucklefuck*
i think some of them want 2 go under the semi truck
The 40-45 stuff drives me crazy…
Driving onto the on ramp yesterday and I see a car in front of me about to merge and all of a sudden they come a complete stop. Thankfully there was enough time and no oncoming traffic that I was able to switch lanes safely. Thankfully I was only starting to accelerate but man some people should not have a license.
I completely agree with this post but the word chucklefuck is just so funny to me
55 mph is **not** an unreasonable speed to merge onto the highway.. more than likely **you** are being an aggressive driver, getting too close and making it dangerous situation. 

When you have somebody going 55 mph that you give them a 2-4+ car’s length lead so you can properly zipper merge.. and then you have time in case they do something drastic; like immediately switch lanes while you’re aggressively trying to overtake. 

Is this not common sense? 🤨 hell, I’m a speedy driver but I know there’s a time and a place
OMG! I swear to Zeus, every time I try to merge I’m stuck behind some fuckingchuck just strolling into the highway well below highway speed. I love your wording. You made me laugh out loud.
Come to South Carolina. These people will literally merge on to the interstate going 30 mph.
They're merging at 55 for you? Lucky! I'm stuck behind people merging at 35-45 all the time..
I've adopted the liberal use of my horn. I learned this from the taxi and ride share drivers in downtown Chicago.
70 is the limit, supposedly reserved for the left lane. Merging at 55 into the right lane seems perfectly safe and reasonable to merge but anyone moving immediately to the middle lane is a dumb ass
Being newly back in Michigan and fully appreciating that 94 functions so much better than 10 or 4 in Florida, if  you're not at 70 by the time you get out of an on-ramp, you're wrong. If you're on the highway and going less than about 90, move over a lane and let people in.
My favorite is getting stuck behind one of these dbags while there is a semi in the right lane that can’t get over to let anyone in because people are cruising in the passing lane. I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve almost been run off the road because I ran out of entrance ramp and had nowhere to go.
Maybe unpopular but 70 is the max, not the required speed. Anything 55 to 70 is perfectly fine.
You ever meet a Texan?
To note on the cutting into the middle lane immediately; Someone doing this has almost gotten me killed omw into work. That lane is for passing and to let others merge. Stay out of it except to pass....
Also, you people trying to block what’s left of the open lane and ruining the zipper merge are going to get yourselves shot. Keep playing around.
There are instances where you're forced around a 25mph curve and then suddenly you have to get up to speed before the ramp ends, and some cars just can't do it. The best I can do on one I use most frequently with the slow curve is get up to 55 before the on ramp ends.
I mean .... my shitbox does 0-60 eventually, and these onramps you can't go over like 35 without sliding, so maybe keep an eye on that on ramp there's bound to be millions more like me in this economy (saturn sc2 2001)
Thats better than tennessee they merge at 45
I see this happening all the time as a ppassenger. In Metro Detroit.
This is why I don't drive on freeways. Merging scares me too much.
when taking drivers ed my instructor told me to merge at atleast 70😂😂
Trying to merge onto the highway near GR where everyone is going at a MINIMUM in the right at 80, and the absolute brainlet in the f250 in front of me decided 35 is the perfect speed to merge. Same f2-350 and RAM 1-3500's that ride everyone's ass like they wanna eat it once they finally decide to get up to speed cause they think having that much tonnage on 4 wheels grows their dick and gives them immediate right of way over literally everyone else. 

also BLINKERS EXIST Y'ALL, USE THEM.

Sorry if this seems overdramatic lol, had to do 2 3-hr cross state drives yesterday and still salty about some people damn near killing us.
Drivers being overly courteous are dangerous. I almost T-boned somebody the other day because they turned left in front of me after making eye contact and an agreement with the person in the lane immediately next to them. They just went ahead and turned across two lanes without even thinking about what was in the lane that they hadn't made an agreement with somebody in.

Things like this have happened to me dozens of times over the last few years as a professional driver. I know y'all think you're being courteous to your neighbors, but the rest of us are following traffic laws. When you make an exception for somebody like that, you have just as much chance of causing an accident as you do of making somebody's day a little better.

I hate this!
It’s not just about getting up to speed, you also have to align with a gap to move into.  To many people think that they can merge over when they want and that the drivers on the expressway have to move for them.  If your on the expressway, your only responsibility is to leave space in front of you for them to move to, if they match speed and that gap
Last I was aware - one can answer EVERY question on the written exam incorrectly and still walk out with a license. SOS personnel are simply required to review the correct answers with you  - so now you know - and then hand over your license.
Oh and I’ll bet a whole ton of money too that they aren’t paying attention to the traffic they are merging into as well. Highway driving is insane these days.
I’m a pretty safe and considerate driver (letting old people have their space and pace not tailgating etc.) so when I see someone merging like they’ve got all the time in the world under the speed of traffic, it pisses me off. It throws off the timing and spacing of literally everyone on the freeway when drivers merge like that.
I haven't heard the word chucklefuck in quite sometime.
School buses that have a speed governor on them are dangerous. Sometimes you have to get out of the way fast or get in a lane fast. I knew one driver who worked her wiles in the boss to get the governor removed from her bus yet the rest of us just had to deal with it. This is why I won't take sports or field trips anymore. I'm just posting this here because being on the highway does involve being able to drive with the "flow of traffic".
Oh hell. That's still better than these morons that stop and wait for an opening. One almost killed my granddaughter and I. I came around the curve on the ramp and there she was, stopped waiting for an opening. Had to pull into a snow bank. Then she realized what happened and she took off.
Yup!!! I’m from IL but have lived in MI for almost 10 years and this still drives me BONKERS. In IL people go nearly 100 just to merge in and I much prefer that.
Yep! Just yesterday, 675 getting on to 75 north in Saginaw. Old guy ahead of us was putzing along, northbound traffic was 75-80mph. We were lucky to find a gap to get into and gun it to get up to speed.
Well op you’re about to love driving on 96 through western Oakland county when all the metered ramps become operational
Truly
You know what I can't wait for? All the Flex Lane's with the Metered Ramps in Novi. I guarantee you that the meter will get backed up and the on-comers turning left on Novi Road and Wixom Road will block the intersection while waiting in line.
That fast, huh? I’ve been all but forced to try to merge at 35 multiple times with absolutely no one in front of the idiot in front of me. They’re gonna get themselves or someone else killed one day,
I moved to Boston and it's so much worse here. It's one of the major things I hate about Mass drivers, and they continually try to merge AT 35 MILES PER FUCKING HOUR. SPEED THE FUCK UPPPPPP
But my wife says I can’t floor it at the top of the ramp and merge at 85 either!
I feel like no one gets following the flow of traffic anymore.
If there were signs that said acceleration lane , maybe that would help.

Off topic - I had an Aunt , when she was  going onto the freeway, she would come to a full stop at the end of the acceleration lane.

My cousins feared driving with her .
YES. This happens way too often when I'm getting on 131 in Kalamazoo. These people need to stay off the highway or be forced to retake driver's training. It's ridiculous and dangerous.
If I don't like it, I can't do much about it.And so what I do is I drop back.

I don't know who had my truck before me, but it's set up really nice, and I can depress the accelerator a third of the way down. And by the time he merges onto the freeway, the other guy in front of me, I'm already up to 65 or 70, put on my left, turn indicator and move to the left lane. And I guarantee i'm gonna be the fastest person in the lane. Unless? The guy behind me wants to go faster, and I'm gonna move over and let him do that. And then I'm gonna stay in his shadow. 'cause he's going faster than we're really allowed, and I want to do the same thing .I love to drive fast, but I can't do that as much  anymore. I'm too old, but I can follow the guy ahead of me.That's fun.

Since I slowed down, i've been, uh, doing something else to keep it interesting. I tend to wanna coast up to the lights' drives. People nuts. I know, but I do it in the right lane, and I don't use my brakes getting on the freeway going downhill. I try to hit that at whatever speed it says with my turn signal on and if the guy behind me doesn't like it? Oh well, I have never had any problems with drivers. Shaking their fists at me, getting out of their vehicles, and trying to make trouble. I'm a man of peaceful intentions, and now that I've slowed down, I get to let people in and yield there because I'm not important, I'm not going anywhere. I'm, i'm retired.Driving is just playing fun for me, and because i'm so old, I have to focus on my driving.

We have an abundance of traffic circles, and it's not for the timid.
Holy shit this is the PSA everyone needs to hear.
On the other side of the coin people need to sometimes realize that the reason I'm going 60 when I get on the highway is because traffic is busy as hell and that's as fast as I can go until there's a break in the next lane. 

I'd also really love if people used their signals all the time, particularly when you're changing lanes going 70 during rush hour?
That Cascade Rd to I96 north in the afternoon is a circus. It gets bogged down every day for that reason. The traffic stays slow until it gets to belt line.
omg if they did that in my state i would be so happy. people here think they should merge at 25, no need to speed up from the onramp you were just on. la di da
they dont give a shit.  my father in law does this now and says its to save gas and wear on the engine.   drives me nuts and i wont let him drive my son around
So many people just don't get merging... Kind of like turn lanes. You get in the turn lane, AND THEN YOU BRAKE! NOT BEFORE! If you brake before getting into the turn lane you have just defeated one of the purposes of said turn lane. Which is giving you a place to turn that doesn't slow down everyone fucking else!
It really sucks because my little Honda doesn’t have much acceleration so if I’m caught behind these people I’m just fucked
Saw someone literally STOP on the on ramp the other day.
I had someone rune off the highway as I was merging in yesterday. They saw me coming and refused to move. The lane over was open. That shit is scary because there are people behind me and I’m there breaking.
At the same time though, fuck the people who refuse to merge behind (i.e. accelerating to overtake but ultimately pacing you until the last possible moment).
Also — stay in the right-most lane unless you’re passing. Move over to pass. Do it quickly. And get back over. 

It keeps traffic moving for everyone and prevents road rage.
Driving always makes my blood pressure go up because of this kind of crap.
You haven't until the guy in front of you on the entrance ramp comes to a complete and dead STOP!!!!!!
I hate that shit. Also, it seems almost nobody realizes that the merging car does not have the right of way. Speed up and get into an opening asap. Don’t go 35 and force people on the freeway to slow down.
Amen!!! And don’t get me started on the fucknuts who drive 70 in the passing lane…
Same with the roundabout at M5 and Pontiac Trail. They come in hot off of NB M5!
Thank you! I grew up in PA and moved here a couple years ago. Love Michigan but I swear, no one here knows how to merge.
and then y'all snowbird down here in Florida and try going 45-50 getting on I75..
MN drivers do 25 sometimes...
holding up traffic in the left lane is what drives me nuts . IF SOMEONE IS ON YOUR ASS IN THE LEDT LANE GET THE FUCK OVER YOUR TO SLOW
I love when we are merging into the left lane and drivers are going 35 after the curve has ended :)
Believe me, I try to accelerate as fast as possible, but I have a woefully underpowered motor in a full size SUV. It's a little slow on the draw
Yes!!! I say the same thing when I get caught behind someone getting on the highway at slow speed. It’s so dumb when people do that!!
And please please please please please for the love of all that is holy and sacred please use your goddamn turn signal. It is a scientifically proven fact that you will loose weight, become sexier and more attractive to your preferred mates, you will get payed more at work, your taxes will be lower all the things you don’t want to work for will magically come to you, if you just use your turn signals all the time.
Big lane? As a European, I find the on-ramps ridiculously short in a lot of places. Some cars you need to floor it to make it to a reasonable speed to merge. European on-ramps are longer, giving you time to speed up and properly look for a spot. I got used to it, but this is the biggest issue I have with the highways here.
When they were finishing up the new 696/75 interchange I was really excited about the long ramp to 75 North. Plenty of room to get up to speed with traffic.

Now every time I use it, I'm stuck behind someone going 30 under traffic flow right to very end. I'm screaming go dude!!! We're about to make everyone slam on their brakes and hopefully not cause a wreck.
The only time I see this as an issue is when you’re on one of those clover on ramps. The long tight curve they make you do makes it impossible to get up to speed before it spits you out essentially in the right lane. Otherwise yeah, if it’s a long straightaway speed up to at least 70 mph so you can merge onto the interstate. 
55, some of these idiots merge at 45.  And they pull into traffic way to early, and don't look.

It's terrible. 

Almost as bad as them driving through round abouts and NOT using their turn signals to indicate what they are going to do!
Chucklefuck😂. I love it!
Jesus. This. Also, I don’t know how many accidents I’ve successfully avoided trying to get off at Washtenaw (37b) on 23 North, when people are trying to enter at the same time I’m trying to exit. Have some f***ing awareness of traffic patterns, please.
Especially when I’m pulling a trailer. I CAN’T brake hard enough for you to wander over. You have to go an appropriate speed.
You're lucky they're doing 55, the drivers in North Oakland County like to merge onto Southbound 75 at about 40 every morning while the flow of traffic is doing between 70 and 80.  I feel like I'm going to die everytime while screaming "hit the GAS!"  over and over.
They do it in Ohio too.
![gif](giphy|8coEmqQxL39eMJcey0|downsized)
Them and the people turning that instead of going into the first available lane cut over immediately into the lane that isn't theirs and cause accidents.
Depends on the interchange. The 75S to 94W is one of the most poorly implemented I’ve ever seen. Zero visibility nearly to the point of merger and no room for acceleration. 

The Ecorse rd to 94 is another hilariously poorly implemented on. Really anything that merges new traffic into the left lane is a disaster.
The entry for getting onto the freeway is 45….move over if you think you’re going to fast. I see people driving 80 plus in that lane and there’s a clear opening in the left lane. Slow down and move over. That’s the law.
The solution? Move to Detroit lmao
Fucking honestly! 


The only spots I can see it being difficult is the I-69 to I-75 interchange outside Flint and the Pontiac exit off of I-75. Whoever designed those specific areas of the highway can get bent. 


Oh, you’re trying to get onto I-75 and merge with traffic? Well enjoy doing that while people trying to get OFF 75 are slowing down to get on Miller road!
Southwest Michigan,  here we have just the opposite problem.  Out of stater, speeding up and as soon as the out of the mergering lane putting on the brakes. I feel like yelling,  "you aren't in a Chicago traffic jam , get moving.  "
Merge at the speed limit of the road  that's why the ramps are long. To give you time to get to speed.
This is exactly when and how I use the word chucklefuck too.
There are so many badly-engineered freeway entrances that I fear for my life every time we go on the freeways. All the last-minute lane changers try to run you over. Really,  I am not an Adrenaline junkie. Just want to arrive in one piece and make it back home.
About a year ago I was stuck behind someone merging at 40, almost caused an accident so I gave them a quick honk before getting up to speed and going around. They chased me down about a mile ahead and pulled a gun on me, so fun.
Counter point. If I'm in an accident I don't have to go to work. 

I'd rather roll the dice at death then be in the office.
I try, but the state doesn’t always give me enough lane
I'll get up to speed on the entrance ramp and if someone is going slow and I can tell they're gonna hold me up, I'll merge early and cross the solid lines.
The only time ive ever done this is when my car, pedal to the floor, couldn’t accelerate fast enough and i hated doing it
You're supposed to merge at 60-70mph, per my driving teacher ... am I missing something? Who the hell does that?
Just because you can go a minimum speed of 55 on the highway doesn't mean you should. 🤦🏻‍♀️
My brother in Christ, the answer to your problems would be to build more rail lines and bus lines in this state.  Humans suck at driving.  Always have, always will.
Bring this up to people who do it and their answer: “I pay taxes and as long as I’m not breaking the law, I can drive as I please”. Duh. But can we also talk about the people who do a last minute three-lane sweep across the freeway to get to their exit? Every single time a get on the freeway I see at least one of these jerks.
I'm a trucker and this pisses me off we have the right of way when already on the freeway then these stupid assholes try to merge slowing us down when we shouldn't  have to either speed up to freeway speed or yield to next available  slot to merge
Glad to have jumped on to Reddit today and learned the term “chucklefuck”. Time well spent for me, so thanks OP.
Idc how fast you go just be aware and make sure you get the fuck out of the way of people. Get over if someone is coming up behind you in the fast lane. Sometimes I wish our cars today were more like bumper cars from the 70s.
55 is being generous. I always get stuck behind the dipshits doing 35.
I'm not even in michigan, got here from All, but holy shit this drives me crazy. I think they genuinely think the speed limit is the same as the street they came from until the moment they're merged. 
In Texas, the service roads say 55, but everyone knows it's really just 70 also
What drives me nuts is there’s hardly any cars on road yet dude has to ride my ass 3 feet distance.  Go around the other lane is open wtf
I drive a semi, and I swear to god, nearly every moron merging onto the highway is doing somewhere between 45 and 55... and I often have cars next to my trailer in the left lane, so I can't move left to give the idiots space. But... place a lot of blame on the SoS and driver instructors. There's no mandatory highway instruction in MI to get a DL... the rules you can find online say you have to display proficiency on expressway, but I have yet to talk to someone how went through drivers Ed and had to get on 96, 94, 31, 131, 75, etc...
maybe if we slowed highways to a safe speed slower merges wouldn't be dangerous. Michigan has an insane rate of crashes because people drive insanely fast and it's just not okay
Not every state has speed up lanes as long as ours. Use them!
For sure. Equally annoying is the guy doing 95 down the high weaving through ppl or riding my bumper while I do the ACTUAL speed limit and he's throwing his hands up 😮‍💨
Scare em or smash their mirror off cops won’t give a f
Try towing a 30 foot trailer in this state! News flash! If you are merging it is your responsibility to merge! It is not my responsibility to slow down or speed up to make a space for you.
I drive on 75 every single day between 696 and Big Beaver, and then back. And I swear to god the amount of people that I have to SLAM on my brakes for because they're too far into the merge lane doing 50 when i'm doing 70 is ridiculous. 

Don't even get me started on the ones that I see do this and I pass them and their face is buried in a phone.
My sister got her permit recently, she says the instructor said don’t speed up till you hit the merge sign 🤣🤣🤣 this is what they’re teaching now
I feel your frustration, it’s not just Michiganders. It’s exactly the same in the Chicago area, where most lanes are doing 75+  and they expect to merge going 20-30 mph slower.
This should be a sign at every on-ramp. 

"Don't be that person. GTF up to speed!"
My dad lived in Detroit MI burb and he told me to never stop on the entrance ramps. Floor it and they will make a hole.
I scream: "IT'S THE LONG, SKINNY PEDAL ON THE RIGHT!" on a daily basis. Not from Michigan (been there), grew up in Illinois, now in Texas. Can relate
I know I’m probably going to get hate for this but can I ask what exactly we are supposed to do when entering the highway. 
I realize this is dumb but I literally never had drivers training( not my choice) once I was over 18 I got my license with a temporary instruction permit and taught myself. I’m still young and trying to learn better
Omg THANK YOU. So sick of these dummies in front of me going slow as hell to merge. Get the fuck out the way before you get us killed.
I noticed this a lot b since pulling b an RV. Don’t they teach them that you’re supposed to be up to speed?
Merge at or above current highway speed
People in Michigan think they have the right of way when merging for some reason.
🤦🏻‍♂️
Dude, when I get on the highway, I rip it and grip it
55 is a legal highway speed. 70/75 is the upper limit. While I agree with you this one should not be idling on to the highway, 55 is acceptable albeit painful to me who wants to hit it at 70. But it's really not reasonable to insist that people be going the upper limit of the speed limit as they merge onto the highway. Or even approaching that.
Most highways have a minimum speed of 45, so if they are doing 55, they are fine, even if it does frustrate you.

If they merge at 55, and they get to the lane before you go by them, slow down or change lanes.  They won.
Not sure how you expect anyone to go from 0 to even 55 on some of the ramps in Michigan that have stop signs right before entering the highway, US23 NB Barton Dr I believe
I’m driving a manual 99 TJ Wrangler in the summer time, I’m lucky to hit 55 in the merging lane.
You have got to relax and slowdown. You clearly can’t handle the speed you’re moving at. If you think people are going to DIE then why are you making a plea to us (we all speed we are Redditors) and not slowing down? What’s so important that it’s worth your life and someone else’s. As you scream “you should have been going 80!” Slamming into some old lady from Manistee.
 55 is still the minimum speed limit as ridiculous as that can be when the limit is 70-75, it should at minimum be the truck speed limit. They really should be getting up to the flow of traffic before merging but that's a foreign concept to a lot of drivers. Too many people try to merge immediately and block cars behind them as well.



I like it when people are going below the speed limit, get in the passing lane, and stay there, even better if they cut you off first because they don't want to be behind a semi that's still 10 seconds away or because they're behind and even slower moving vehicle and either can't wait or don't pay attention to the 3.5 tons of metal already in the process of passing them. Then there's the nut going 90+ weaving through traffic as a construction zone approaches, good times. That's just the stretch of 10 I drove on the Saturday before last to 75 on way to Auburn Hills, where the drivers were somehow less ridiculous, at least until I got close to Flint where the next game of "how big an accident can we create driving recklessly through active construction" began".

On my way back I did what I was going to do on the way down and took the less stressful "scenic" route, and took 15 up to Bay City/Essexville. Longer in terms of time but I wasn't in a hurry anyway. Was good for my gas mileage  too.
If we are listing grievances.  When merging if there are multiple folks trying to merge dont pull out and go around the folks in front of you trying to merge.
That's ok, some bitch in the left lane won't let me scoot over when people are merging at 45.
I was behind a guy doing 45. Like it was time to merge and he still wasn't accelerating. Cars flying by us in the right lane, we're in the merge lane needing to merge NOW. I'm not sure if it's drugs, alcohol, or some kind of "civilian speed police" attitude. But people going slow are more dangerous than people going fast.
Genuinely what the fuck is up with this? It's not like once every 5 or 6 times I try to get onto the freeway, it's no exaggeration, 95% of the time where the person in front of me is still going 45 by the time we're at the end of the entrance ramp, lane is coming to an end and we can't merge because we are going damn near half the speed of the traffic we're trying to merge into.

Why is this such an extremely common thing?

What I find myself doing now just by habit, is slowing down and creating distance before/during the ramp so that way I can have enough space to accelerate to 70 and merge safely.
I’ve seen a lot of posts lately about driving anxiety. They think everybody else is gonna cause them to wreck cause they’re going slow and people are ZOOMING past. Several times I’ve had to jump on these posts with these poor people to tell them they are the ones going to cause a wreck by driving too slow and that they need to either get off the road or get help.
They can drive right up a wall. They enter the freeway at 45 then speed up to 70.  My guess is that they think merging a t60-65 is too difficult when in fact it is easier.
In the last couple of weeks I've seen a lot of that in Oregon. I've also noticed a lot of 'driver training' cars on the road so maybe it's the season for that kind of thing, people who don't know that the freeway on ramp is not 35mph like the street they were on before.
I got trapped behind a coworker who did this a few times.

It took all my willpower to keep my mouth shut at work around her.
As a Michigander now living in the Bay Area this is pretty much it. Every Prius and Tesla merging far below the speed limit. People going below the speed limit in the left lane. It’s absolutely maddening and makes no sense. And there are no cops ever doing anything about it
I'm starting to wish we all had to get retested every 10 years or so. It's absurd that they give you a 6 week class when you're 14 and then you're good for life
I found out the other day that it’s legal in Michigan to sell a car to someone without a drivers license

They do teach at driver education. I know because my son just finished. Either everyone forgets or it wasn’t required before idk.

Edit grammar
the real trouble is, driving is a defacto requirement to participate in society. what's the alternative for bad drivers? they don't get to have a job?
[deleted]
Floor it, catch up, pick a spot and slide in.
my frequent road rage scream is “THIS IS AN ACCELERATION LANE”.
This is exactly it. When accelerating onto the freeway, it is the duty of the individual that is merging to match the speed of traffic and find a safe spot to merge in. It is not the duty of flowing traffic to make space and adjust for a car to safely merge in to the active driving lane. Also, a car should not create a condition to block a car from merging. Either by speeding up or slowing down.

Now mind you. Cars should be following each other at a safe distance leaving plenty of room at all times to allow for changing conditions. Which drivers typically don't do.

Edit: it is written law per the MCL listed in a few comments below. The driver merging onto the freeway must yield to drivers on the freeway.
The PNW is so notorious for this. Drives me crazy.
Grew up in Cali but was being in Mi and recently moved. Yeah traffic here is nothing like in cali.. far worse and also in the last couple years also I had the meth head homeless running across the freeway on occasion and even camped near some exits (and everywhere else) in sac
Grew up in Michigan now in California, I was taught the same. The driving here is horrific. People have zero spatial awareness, no respect for the left “fast lane” (if that’s taught), and generally do whatever they want. I’m convinced that’s why traffic is so bad here.

Unfortunately the drivers in Michigan have gotten worse as well, I noticed during a vacation. The other states I’ve driven in aren’t much better.

From what I can gather drivers don’t care, don’t know, are anxious, distracted, or have false beliefs (like slower is safer). I think covid had an effect too since some people haven’t driven regularly for multiple years.

road tests are such an unregulated wild west, its why terrible drivers exist
Michigan born and raised. Currently grinning and bearing it in Illinois. These people have all the time in the world to get nowhere apparently.
For real.  After spending some time outside of the state, Michigan has the best drivers. 55 is a dream outside of Michigan. No one can merge anywhere else. They coming in at 35.
My sibling did that once (back when they were a new driver). We both cringe every time we think back on it - like wow, that was dangerous as hell. 
When I go out to SoCal to visit family they have lights at a lot of ramps. Granted this for when traffic is really heavy so speeds aren't as crazy, but still a little nerve racking.
We don’t have stop signs at the end of entrance ramps in Michigan but it is the law to yield to highway traffic so if one cannot safely accelerate into a merge then one must yield/stop and wait.
Denver has lights at some ramps.  You go when the light flashes green.
Apparently the correct order is:
1) Brake to near stop
2) Get in the turn lane 
3) Begin turn
4) Apply turn signal
And you don't get in the turn lane, sit with your turn signal on, then use it as a merge lane.
Yes. That and turning from the lane you are in by slowing down out of nowhere and turning on your signal when you're halfway into the turn. I just don't understand some people.
I was shocked and bewildered the first time I was in Ohio and came upon a fucking stop sign at the *end of the on ramp*!!
So this happened a few years ago. I'm leaving work and getting on the highway. There's one guy on the ramp ahead of me. He had gotten up to speed - not the speed limit but fast enough for me to start looking over my shoulder to pick the spot where I was going to merge. But in the corner of my eye I see red. So I looked over and the guy had come to a complete stop. I laid on my brakes but would have shit plowed him if I hadn't turned under the shoulder. I knew exactly who he was from work. I threw my hands up at him then passed him.
Maryland drivers still exist though.
If only people knew what game first responders refer to this as, "bitches in ditches" 

What in the fuck is a coeffecient of friction?
Nightmare? Foot to the floor is the fun part lol. But yeah, whoever designed this and thought it would be a good idea should be shot.  The nightmare only comes when you realize you’re about to share that merge lane with a semi-truck lol
23 south off of Washtenaw.  I used to have a Ford Festiva.  I'd end up driving down the shoulder trying to get up to 55, much less up to speed lol.
Yes! We're talking about you, black Chevy pickup eastbound 94 to Port Huron. Parks his ass in the left lane at about 73 mph, unless he's next to a truck, then he slows down a little to make it last. Gets past the truck and speeds up enough to not allow someone getting around him. Meanwhile, it's a lane changing clusterfuck behind him.....every fucking afternoon!!!
Even if you are, get out of it if you aren't in the act of passing!
Who do we have to pay to have police enforce this law. The only law cops follow is “durrr is this number higher than this one??”
That law does not apply to highways with three or more lanes.
WB 196 to SB 131 feels specifically designed to brutally murder as many people as possible.
I definitely give someone a pass if they have an older car. I know it takes longer to get up to speed. As long as you're TRYING, I don't get mad lol.
At least I can go around them at that point.
Or brake before putting on their turn signal to get into a middle turn lane
"Well, I'm almost home, so fuck everyone else!"
rush hour traffic only exists because of people like this, change my mind
Yup, go a 1/4 or 1/2 mile and then they figure out where they are and mash it.  Meanwhile, everyone else has just caused a mile long break check just for them to get on.
keep your lane. keep your speed. it is upon the merging driver to accelerate in front of you or slide in behind.
When I was driving a beat to shit old work truck I admit there were moments of "How much would it hurt if I just hit this jackass?"
This is exactly how you gotta do it, tailgating a slow driver doesn’t allow you to sling shot around them. If you grow up in the country you learn this early when you get stuck behind a trailer/tractor/farm equipment
I do this five days a week getting on the Holbrook ramp to north 75 lol
Every single time I get onto m53 north from m59 this exactly what I do.
Yeah, traffic safety goes out the window with the interstate designs around Lansing and I hate it. There are way too many sharp ramps where the speed is posted 25-35 and it’s hard to go higher — but as soon as the ramp is over you are either 1) on the highway where everyone is going 70+ and you barely have time to accelerate; 2) have to quickly accelerate and merge to an inside lane because the one you are in is now an exit lane for the off ramp because clover field ramps are dumb as fuck; 3) you still have to get onto the highway proper but in order to do you so need to cross TWO lanes of traffic that are already attempting to exit at full speed.
I absolutely hate driving on the expressway anywhere really, but I lived in Lansing and got mainly used to the ones around there, but I was in Royal Oak last year and had to get on 696. It was rush hour on Memorial day. Super scary to me, but yeah at least everything flowed well
M59 and 75 S.  GTFO with that double use lane shit
Because they’ve never mentally graduated from being a student driver.
Also you idiots trying to get to lane after merging from 131 to 96. STOP IT!
It's so easy to identify the guilty parties in these comments
If he’s breaking then he should’ve just pulled into the shoulder to fix it
Here's the thing. This has conditioned drivers to think they can just stroll on down the ramp and everybody has to get out of their way. That is not true and we need to stop being so courteous. If you're on the ramp it is your job to look over your shoulder, pick a spot to merge, then adjust your speed faster or slower to get there. It is your job to merge, not anybody else's job to let you in.
That's great and all but I'm talking about when I'm trying to merge correctly and on stuck behind miss Daisy while trying to merge into a bunch of ass holes going 80 in the slow lane while on their phones
Also, don't speed or tailgate in the right lane so drivers will be able to merge in without using a shoehorn.
[deleted]
It’s not just courteous, it’s the law in Michigan. 

But OP is talking about being stuck behind the slow car on the on-ramp, which is especially terrifying when you can see a semi doing 65 coming
This is an important corollary!  Another one is: if the merge lane is short (like the 100-foot joke at 23 and Washtenaw in Ann Arbor) it may not be possible/safe to get up to 70 prior to merging, especially if the right lane is packed.

Give people room and it’s a lot easier for them to get up to speed before merging without running out of lane.
No, that’s not correct.

Legally the merging vehicle and the vehicle in the lane of traffic must work together.
Yes! The driver merging in can't see your brake lights. The speed they're trying to match to merge (if doing it right. Big "if".) is now a moving target and they're not acutely aware of it, making a safe merge that much more difficult.
Look, in my personal vehicle, it’s one thing. At work? Fuck that. You’re just gonna have to suck it up sometimes. I ain’t pissing in a cup cuz they merged into me. 😆 I wish I could tho.
Steal away, how do you think I got to using it?
Drivers definitely got worse after the pandemic.
Man I miss my pandemic commutes. Those were glorious.
Through the curve sure, but as soon as you're at the exit of it, you push the pedal down, not keep cruising at sub walking speed.
You can accelerate through the curve mildly and then pedal to the floor as soon as you’re comfortable (which is probably sooner than you think). Any relatively modern car can get from 35-40 to 70-75 in the time it takes from the curve to needing to merge IF the driver actually tries. I get the feeling a lot of drivers are afraid of using their entire gas pedal for fear of damaging their car or gas mileage. PSA, pedal to the floor is the fun part of driving ;)
Okay but did you really think I was talking about those few very specific circumstances?
Unless your foot is to the floor while merging, you’re not trying hard enough.
And some are blatantly unsafe with the right lane obscured until it's too late - or the merge lane cut short by construction (in the latter case, i guess it's better to hit the barricade than then other car)
Disparity in speed causes car accidents. Educate yourself so you don't come off sounding like a condescending a-hole.
When we were driving to spring break we got stuck in traffic near Cincy over the bridge to Kentucky with SO many semis, and when we all got to move forward a few feet they would hit the gas instead of just easing off the brakes and then stop with inches to spare. Like, you know there will be paperwork if you flatten us, right?? 😅
no one should be able to hit 60 on the Southfield on-ramps because the speed limit there is 55. :) (not that that stops me from going faster once I’m on the freeway…)
👏👏👏👏
They also should not do that
Tell me your comment is dated without telling me your comment is dated “taxis”. LOL
Thankfully, no
Can't go over 35 without sliding? You need new tires.
If your car can't get up to highway speed, it's not safe for you to be on the highway 
get off the passing lane u turtle
I bet you were the kid who reminded the teacher they forgot to give out the homework on Friday
Yeah that's one ramp in the whole state, of course I'm not talking about that extreme outlier
You should not be on the highway if your vehicle can't get up to highway speed on a reasonable time
Amen. I had the same issue with my 08 multiple times on 275.
[deleted]
In studies they have found that the larger the difference between fast and slow traffic, the higher the risk of accidents. Doesn't really matter how fast the traffic is going, as long as everyone is going about the same. 

So yes, someone driving under the limit on the freeway is just as at fault as someone driving over the limit.

Since more people speed, it's actually more on the slower drivers, if they weren't the slow outliers, we would have safer roads.
That has always been the case, even on the freeway. Some guy like you're saying gets in left lane and just stays there and cars back up behind, and then people use the other lanes. And there's all sorts of consequences in this guy is oblivious, totally oblivious to the a carnage that's going on behind him, because he will not drive the speed limit. And he will not move over.

I'm not young anymore so I don't have fire in my pants. But I have learned how to drive slow and still get on the freeway and do freeway stuff. But when the speed limit's 25, I'm going 25 I might even begin going less than that. If children play around wherever I am I have to be careful about that. I don't live in the city anymore, but still That one time that ball came rolling into the street in front of me.I can see it like it was yesterday.

I knew there'd be a kid behind that ball, so I just stopped and waited and there he was and I left my car in the middle street. Asked him where he lived and took him home and asked his father to look after him and then I left. I wasn't there to be friendly. I was on my way somewhere, but that really bothered me.

That was probably at least forty years ago, could have been fifty time flies when i'm having fun.
Could not agree more. You can always slow down. You cannot always speed up, and once you run out of ramp there’s no way for idiots to get up to speed.
I always leave a gap for the reasons you state and this is where having a car with good acceleration is a safety feature.  Being able to purposefully place yourself where you want to be while assuming everyone else is going to kill you (motorcycle mentality).
During COVID, drivers didn't have to do the kind of in-person driving exams that are normal, so a ton of people who failed before were able to get their licenses on the written tests only, and a ton of people who would have failed trying for the first time slipped through. The amount of people who freak out about the speed "limit" wording right now and have decided they can drive any number under that seems to have gone up as well.
>I’ve seen a lot of posts lately about driving anxiety. They think everybody else is gonna cause them to wreck cause they’re going slow and people are ZOOMING past.

These are the people who cause wrecks.
What I always say: if you can't drive like a normal person, don't drive! I think people who are really just too old to drive because they don't have the reaction speed anymore insist on driving because it's what they've always done. Then they do stuff like this or drive their car into a building or whatever.
I have talked to numerous people over the years. That will not drive on the freeway because they are scared. I have anxiety, but II don't let it bother me when I'm driving. I can be a beast or I can be a really nice guy.

And I kind of went the nice guy route. Now that i'm older, and when there's construction, I tend to move over a little bit earlier, even though I know that geometry, we'll get me in in front of somebody, there's nothing they can do about it.
That's how I dealt with it.

Around these here parts, aunt people with handicapped plates, I got nothing against that. I'm gonna get one by the way, but it seems to me. They drive 10 miles below the speed limit on. You know the mile roads in the Northsouth main roads? I've been observing that for 40 or 50 years, and maybe I'm wrong, but Just seems to me that's the way it is because they know they're invulnerable.
I have to agree with you. I don't know if they are just ignorant or doesn't care about the rules.
Everyone could use a refresher course every 5-10 years of what the rules of the road are. For just about every professional license you get you have to do continuing education. Why not a license to drive a few ton metal box at 70+mph.
The problem is that most of these idiots could probably still pass a retest with someone in the car forcing them to pay attention. 

It's the everyday shit that they suck at
Made a presentation about this in my college class lol
The problem would be that the same dumbass instructors who taught these people incorrectly would be the same people giving you the retest!
I bet they don't do it because of how much of the over 60 crowd would lose their licenses...
Now that they've introduced roundabouts they absolutely need to retest anybody over 40... I'm 59 and the only reason I knew how to use them is because I lived in Virginia for a couple years, most people my age were completely clueless to them and hate them now that they're forced to use them
You're supposed to get 50 hours of practice driving between two classes. But I have had several parents tell me the log isn't even checked - and it's really easy to cheat. So many kids aren't even getting the minimum practice!
I think there should be a free online test due at every renewal. Take it as many times as you need. Open book. It would be a very low bar to clear, but it could be a reminder of basic rules of the road.
I agree, and I've long said that I think they go easy on the road test because you're a brand new driver. Test again at 21 when they can now legally drink and make it significantly harder.
Many folks don't even have the classes. If your parents can't afford it, you wait until your 18, take an easy written test, have a permit for 30 days, pass a basic road course and off they go. Where I took my test, there are no major highways so you don't even have to get on one. They count the state highways instead.
They don't go on the highway for a road test. I never understood that. Like the 3 point turn and parallel parking were a big deal but not entertaining and existing a highway?
[deleted]
I understand. I don't like it, but I understand. You can own a car even if you never drive it. Though the number of people who own a car but don't drive is pretty close to zero.
Did you find out the hard way?
That's how the foreign university students here without licenses can drive around their Porsches and Lambos.
Ownership doesn't mean they can legally operate it
Imagine telling somebody the best transportation method requires a $40k buy in to start, plus constant cost for use and maintenance. Absolutely would not be acceptable for anything other than cars 
You know what, I'm going to start doing that.
I always end up hanging back, looking for a shot and then accelerate trying to slingshot around them.
Good, I’m not the only one.
Good luck doing that at rush hour on 696 with multiple semis on the road and construction
I mentally heard this comment in Jason Alexander's voice! "AN ACCELERARION LANE, JERRY!"
Just got back from Maine - big signs by every on-ramp. “It’s the law to move over and let oncoming traffic merge”. Wouldn’t that be nice?
I spent some time in SC and apparently the on ramp is also the stop and look ramp. Goddamn morons.
Ackshually in Michigan it is the law that you move to the left (NOT hit your brakes) to let mergers in
I swear it’s a western US issue. Saw it all the time in Denver and Salt Lake too, but never down in Tampa area. Anecdotal but good enough for me 🤷‍♂️
It is the worst thing about the PNW. They all sit in the left lane doing 10 under, as well. I drive in the right lane passing people here.
Traffic in southern California is easily worse than Michigan. But a wide margin.
You're unhinged  and speaking in metric...HaHaHa.
I returned to Michigan for a vacation, the drivers were worse compared to years ago.
It’s such a foreign concept to me. When I was young and my dad was teaching me to drive, he was really big on merging smoothly. Signs or stop lights throw me off completely.
Well you mistake was entering Ohio.
lol. I’d run that. Fuck stopping there
M-14 lol
I was in Baltimore last week and some chucklehead in an Old Dominion box truck almost took my front end off down by pier V.  Michigan still worse 😂
i'd love to see people start to get pulled over for failing to use a turn signal. I take US-23 to work and i can usually count on one hand the number of people i see actually use it when changing lanes.
All the other laws are just so gosh darn complicated, you're asking a lot of them
Yes, it does.
Thank you! I get so mad when it's a dude in a mustang going 30 in front of me and then he stomps on it at the end of the ramp while I'm stuck trying to get on now at 35 😂
True but I try to move over if I can. That way I don't have to worry about some asshat forcing me out of my lane by moving over anyways, when they are going 20 mph slower then the traffic they are merging with.
Preach!!!
Yeah, I hear ya on 696. It's not peaches and cream, but since the 496/127 construction has been taking place, I feel at risk. I have had a few close calls, and a couple were my fault. I am blessed to be alive!
Yeah this is precisely where I was talking about. It’s just awful.
Just not during rush hours you tarts
lol, good catch.
You also have people that just ride the acceleration lane all the way to the end and not check any of their surroundings and think just because the lane ends they’re automatically allowed to just move over regardless of anyone being there
Nope, that’s completely wrong.

The law requires you to let them in. At the same time the law prohibits them from forcing their way in as you both have a form of right of way.
No it isn’t. They can run off the road, take the shoulder, hit the gas, or hit the brakes. They need to learn to pick one.
In the city it’s not a specific circumstance, it’s like every single ramp.
It literally was.
The one specifically on 275 that I used was on an overpass. So that wasn't even a safer option. And this was at 630am. AM! 

I work in construction so I only had to drive that for a few months, but everyone drives like an asshole out in Westland. I had a dude get road rage on me because I didn't realize the right lane ended and "cut" in front of him to get over after the intersection. They were doing constant roadwork and I had to take a new way there and back almost daily so I didn't have the roads or speeds memorized.

And I got a ticket there. Tbf I was speeding but just wasn't paying attention because I was tired and didn't see what the speed limit was.

0/10
The driving is awful here. Going from metro Detroit driving to whatever the fuck they're doing down here has been the worst experience. I just assume that the IQ is significantly lower down here.
I mean, we both know that stretch right out of Southfield is basically an unmarked Indy 500 Qualifier 🤣 but I get you, I wish that right lane stayed more around 55-60
I was just there last weekend. Took two of them. ¯⁠\⁠_⁠(⁠ツ⁠)⁠_⁠/⁠¯
Nope. I stay in the right lane. Bet you're the one speeding. Have you had speeding tickets? 🤭
I bet you were the one that graduated high school at 19.
This is most of the ramps in downtown Detroit. The speed limit is 55, and the ramps are made short as a result. Expecting people to get up to 85 on a 75 foot on-ramp is a stretch.
How does that assumption work for combination vehicles rolling at 105,000lbs, cause theyre out there pretty much everywhere every day but Sunday.  They are definitely not merging at 55, on some on ramps theyre only going 35-40.  

This post is a matter of convenience for people that want to go fast.  Driving is about adapting to conditions, some people struggle not because they are incapable but because they have a difficult time not getting what they want.  

It is preferred to get up to speed and merge but we all know that it doesnt always work like that for one reason or another.  The matter is a safety issue when drivers behave erratically and unpredictably, sling shotting is probably not a safe behavior.  The OP started this post saying safety is the priority but I actually believe he doesnt want to be inconvenienced on his way to Initech.
THIS
It's defensive driving to let someone over. Either the person to my left or the one coming up the right. Someone can be getting on the freeway at an appropriate speed and the timing is slightly off where getting over is easier.
Case in point, old ramps in GR that are small when merging was at 45, no anticipation lanes along the highway they are so short
Also freeways are about 2x as safe as non-freeways when indexed for vehicle/miles despite faster speeds.
This so much. Might be the same study but drivers who are going 10 mph under the speed limit are just as much of a danger as those who go 10 over. Also, people need to be reminded the left lane is for passing only. Just today on my drive from Battle Creek to Kalamazoo I got stuck behind someone going 65 in the left lane and not moving over. The amount of traffic behind me had to be at least a half mile long… because of the idiot refusing to get over.

About a week ago another person on 94 was going 50 mph pulling a trailer. Use back roads if you are going that slow. No reason to be on the highway at that speed.
>In studies they have found that the larger the difference between fast and slow traffic, the higher the risk of accidents.

Yes. And the #1 cause of accidents is unpredictable behavior while in traffic.

If your'e in a 65 going 45 you're more likely to cause an accident.

If you stop at roundabouts when you don't need to you're probably going to cause an accident.

If you don't use signals, stop suddenly or drive slow in a fast line because you're on your phone, you're going to cause an accident.

Drivers who drive fast but pay attention are going to be less problematic than slow and distracted drivers.
+1 on the acceleration. I love my little commuter shitbox, but if I’ve got the air on, that little turbo 4 struggles mightily to get anywhere near highway speed by the end of the ramp. Especially if it’s one of the shorter ones.
Probably a little bit of both. That and boomers that need to have their keys taken away
Provided the minimum speed on the highway isn’t higher than 55, what rule are they breaking?
Professions generally advance with time so continuing ed makes sure you don't miss out on new things. They aren't usually refresher courses.

Driving laws generally stay the same. In fact the law
MCL 257.627(8)) states...

"The minimum speed limit on all limited access freeways upon which a
minimum speed limit is not otherwise
fixed under this act is 55 miles per hour"

Has been that way since 1949.

The person OP is hating on and everyone's  jumping on for "not knowing the rules" or "needing to go back to drivers ed"  has been following the law that's been in place for the last 75 years.
Think 55 is too slow for the expressway? Write your rep telling them to fight to raise the limits. And MDOT to eminent domane as much land is needed to get rid of all those clover style ramps with 35mph caution limits til the last 30 yards.

Of course given the amount of people who think "this is they way I've done it or was taught" hating on this driver who IS LEGALLY following the rules maybe a more constant refresher wouldn't be bad idea. It's just not the ones people think who need it.
Refresher course sure.  Will they implement their learning?  I’m leaning towards no.  Are we a free country?  Sure.  In today’s times,  that means I can do what I want.  Emphasis on “I”.  We have too many distractions now a days.  Prescription drugs,  weed, technology and finally police who will not pull people over anymore for anything.  I drive everyday to work and I watch people do dumb shit right in front of cops.  Nothing happens.  Even being behind people smoking weed while driving.
Please expand it and turn it into a published work, we all would benefit
Roundabouts have been around in MI for a while just not all over the place like they are starting to become. I live up near traverse city and for over 20 years now theres been several in the area with a new one popping up in gaylord as well (which also already had a single one before for a good 20+ years).
It's more of the 40's and younger,  the ages when they took drivers ed out of the schools and made it for profit.
Ya.  But of those people, the numbers of cars they have is  probably really high
No I found out from a reddit comment, thank god lol
I gladly pay the $40k buy in and extra $$$ for maintenance so I don’t have to sit near people and leave on my own schedule.
Then THEY get mad and brake check you and you slam into methhead Mike's Geo Metro.
What gets me is more when it’s one of the newer style ramps that’s super long and they still get over right away at like 45 or 55. I usually floor it and merge in front of them at 70 with ramp to spare.
I do this also. Was pulled over for it and was told it's a merge lane, not a shoot around lane. Even though I was past the solid line. Apparently, you are supposed to wait for the person in front of you to merge before you do. I'm not really sure the officer wasn't very helpful and was getting very angry for asking what I did wrong.
Maybe a Zipper Merge then 🫤
But it's not always possible. I was almost killed yesterday when some chucklefuck was doing 45 in front of me and I had a massive Suburban on the passing lane blocking my escape.
Unfortunately for you, that's not how the law Works in Michigan. It's your responsibility to merge into traffic, as it is in most States.
Sorry, there was too much traffic in the next lane. You’re going to have to use your accelerator pedal.
Which makes sense, the on ramp has no where to go on the highway except onto the highway, the highway has multiple lanes and more options, it should be those in the highway that need to make room.
Ackshually, that's not true. A vehicle in a lane of traffic has right of way and does NOT need to yield or move over for the merging car. If A car is in the lane of travel and unable to change lanes. What then? The merging driver must yield the right of way and slow down so as to enter the freeway safely. At the end of the day the goal is to not crash. 1 vehicle performing a change in traffic conditions is more predictable than 2 cars changing the conditions of traffic.

The laws cannot be written to encompass every situation at every occurrence. The laws of the road would eventually contradict itself. If a loaded down semi is entering a packed freeway. This law can now come into question. A semi can't maneuver well. So you can choose to be in the right and dead, or choose to be alive. I'm sure most people will choose to be alive and change lanes for the semi.

Which isn’t always safe. And as I often drive a commercial box truck, if I’m in that, honey, you bettter use gas or brakes cuz I got blind spots and I ain’t changing lanes unless I’m absolutely certain it’s clear, and I’m damned sure not doing it suddenly or last second. Gas or brakes, gas or brakes. Or run off the road, idc. And I can guarantee you that if that law exists, which is a big if, it says something about IF safe to do so. And if I’m not certain it’s clear, it isn’t safe to do so. So gas or brake, gas or brake.
You are wrong. I don’t fault you for it, because it’s a common misconception. The law requires the merger to yield to traffic on the highway, by adjusting their speed to merge in. Traffic on the highway must not intentionally block a driver from merging. The proper merging technique is called the Zipper. When everyone practices good merging etiquette, the Zipper is a thing of beauty. It used to be the norm on highways back in the day. It’s what most older drivers were taught in Drivers Ed, back when it was free at your local high school.
When a vehicle approaches the intersection of a highway from an intersecting highway or street that is intended to be, and is constructed as, a merging highway or street, and is plainly marked at the intersection with appropriate merge signs, the vehicle shall yield right of way to a vehicle so close as to constitute an immediate hazard on the highway about to be entered and shall adjust its speed so as to enable it to merge safely with the through traffic.

Taken directly from MCL 257.649...

The burden is on the merging driver. If you merge onto the highway under speed and get hit... by law, you are at fault
If you can. But you at highway speed by the time you get to the highway.
You're forgetting the endless line of cars going 95 in the left lane so you can't get over but I feel you. 😂
I remember lol.. I used to live in South Pasadena as well, and people complain about a little traffic here in eastern mi and I'm like... This ant nothin.
THROW HIS ASS INTO BOSTON HARBOR WITH THE REST OF THE TEA!
Just yesterday, my spouse mentioned to me, in confidence, that she kinda likes Ohio. 

I am presently searching for an attorney.
They had the same for a long time on some on ramps to 94 in Detroit. Blew my mind seeing them.
Sorry but it doesn't.  Read the statute
I would love to see this law.
Incorrect
Never mind anyone hauling cargo.
Interesting
We didn’t actually get run over so I guess I shouldn’t complain, but it was nerve wracking for sure
Not yet! 🤫
100% op doesn’t care about safety they care about convenience.
Max speed on a loaded chip truck is about 65 so I think OP is a princess 
That's a ticket offense. It's too bad that they don't enforce it often.
I notice it's of all driving ages.
Hey man I'm a boomer. I'll merge on to an expressway quicker than most of you young punks!
Just like the one episode on South Park about old people and their driver’s license
I once had to pass a girl on the right. She was in her 20s, on her phone, smoking a joint and strolling in the passing lane. Young are not always better drivers.
Beg to differ on the laws and conditions. I learned to drive in 86. The speed limit was 55, there were no round abouts, there were no self driving cars, and many signals have changed. Also, many states have different laws as well as carpool lanes and no right turns on red. So yes, as you get older, some critical laws change or if you move, some laws are different. Also, etiquette needs to be updates like adaptive cruise conyril in the left lane doesn't five you the right to camp there. Finish your pass and get over to the right.
Every cert I've ever seen that is for safety requires refresher courses: CPR, working from heights, confined space, laser safety. And none of them have changing requirements.

Also, in the vast majority of Michigan the expressway speed is 65+.
What's legal and what is safe can be two different things. When there is traffic and it's moving the large speed difference is dangerous it doesn't matter if it is legal, Just like how graveyards are filled with people who had the right of way.
If you are entering the highway, you need to be driving at the speed of traffic, regardless of what the legal speed limit is. If everyone is driving 20 because it's rush hour, driving 55 is extremely dangerous. If traffic is going 70, merging at 55 is dangerous. Considering these slow mergers are still speeding up a mile later, this isn't a case of them thinking the speed limit is 55. Especially since, other than a few very limited locations, the speed limit on all highways is 70.

> Professions generally advance with time so continuing ed makes sure you don't miss out on new things. They aren't usually refresher courses.

Refresher courses are required for most professionals, especially when it comes to regulations. Staying in compliance with laws, regulations, and requirements is an active process that isn't just one and done.
Bingo thank you OP is the problem 55 is the legal minimum speed and i have no problem with someone doing 55 in the right lane the people i have a problem with are the ones that just drive in the left lane no matter what speed they are going the left lane is for passing not cruising
55 is the "minimum" speed for expressways in MI... and that's meant for inclement weather. If you're doing 55 on dry roads with clear visibility when the speed limit is 70-75... do everyone else a favor and take the surface roads
Imagine encouraging the government to steal land💀
 If you're 15 years old taking drivers Ed then anyone over 40 was probably not trained on roundabout driving because roundabouts were few. Now they're becoming popular and half your driving population was never trained how to maneuver thru roundabouts.
Yep! People with main character syndrome severe enough to think this is acceptable driving are not the type of people who can self-reflect and improve after being honked at. They will get angry about it as if you're the problem for honking, and eventually someone is unhinged enough to follow you home and try and kill you with a crowbar.
I believe there's a strong correlation between Road work and Road Rage. I know this because I never got pissed off driving when I lived in Northern Michigan. When I moved down here with all the lane closures, road work, and backups, I started getting pissed when I drove. I basically trained my self to drive the speed limit or 5 MPH lower and just follow people I get less stressed driving doing this as I don't like I'm "Stuck" behind someone and not in such a rush. Wish they'd fix the roads a lot quicker like they do in other states. Work through the nights and get the crap done. These 5 year projects are crazy.
Exactly! I understand the shitty old ramps that you don't have time to get all the way up to speed, but on the ones that seem like they're 1/2 mile long, it STILL happens. 

And it's not like the cars doing it don't have the pick up and go to actually accelerate. They just don't.
I like it when that happens. Just go by them on the right and no problem looking for existing traffic.
Fuck that and fuck that cop for not pulling over the slow ass driver instead.
If you're blocking them from merging onto the highway, that's extremely dangerous. If you're moving multiple lanes so the rightmost highway lane is free, you should be good. But you have to watch out for traffic and and cop with a chip on their shoulder is going to claim you were "reckless."
In MI it is the merging driver's responsibility to merge. Highway traffic has the right of way
Good luck doing that when the car infront of you is going 30-45 mph, on a short ramp, and is taking their time to merge. I've had to  Either get off the ramp completely, if there was a chance to do that, Or nearly get into accidents becasue of people who *refuse* to get up to speed.
I always thought this too, but in a similar post here on r/Michigan earlier this year, another redditor posted a quote from the actual relevant MI law that stated there is some expectation that the vehicle on the road attempt to let the merging vehicle in, whether that’s moving to the left, or adjusting speed. Basically there is some responsibility put on both drivers.

Edit: after reading the law, it does state through traffic has the right of way and merging traffic must match the flow of traffic. However, there’s also the expectation that both drivers do what they can to avoid a collision, so if the merging vehicle simply refuses to adjust their speed and a collision is imminent, a judge would put some fault on the through vehicle if they made no attempt to avoid a crash.
Obviously for the record the merging car still needs to make an effort to get up to speed. Semis usually can’t get over to the left, and they’re going 65, so…. you do the math
Bigger cities will do this to break up traffic entering the highway. Instead of one long line of cars merging on causing a traffic jam because everybody tailgates, one car will come on at a time and merging is much smoother.
There’s still one on like 94 or 23 outside of Ann Arbor
Ann Arbor, Barton drive
You’re def the person driving 68mph in the left lane on 94.
Yup. The other day was entering behind a car doing 45. They didn't even speed up when they got onto the highway proper. Passed them and it was a man in his 20s or early 30s.
Yeah, well, i'm an assignment generation and if you wanna operate an automobile, it takes courage.

These days I would never cross the street like I used to.I'd get killed.

I stuck my nose out into traffic and this guy nearly took my front end off. That's the way it looked anyway. I'm smiling, are you looking for a fight.

I'm not. I focus on my driving and I have to wear sunglasses and sometimes I wear my really cool boomer baseball cap .
Same!  It’s just easier for some to drop the word boomer in whatever annoys them.
Yeah that's true but I'm talking about the specific situation where gamgam has the pudding brain and doesn't remember which pedal makes the stop and which makes the vroomvroom. There are multiple types of bad drivers out there
Was hoping to find someone mention the advent of round-abouts, bike lanes, cell phones, etc. Because you’re right, things have and do change with time. People need to be educated on the proper usage of all the new things
Expressway have a upper and a lower speed limit. Lower limit is 55mph upper is what ever is posted.
I agree with your general point but CPR did change inbetween re-certs for me, and I was *actively* doing CPR before and after
And this refresher course would teach what's legal
So when the majority of people are breaking the law the ones that arent are the problem ? Thats some ass backwards thinking
> Especially since, other than a few very limited locations, the speed limit on all highways is 70.

If you travel out of state the speed limit in other states is as low as 55mph. I drove from northern MI down to Kentucky a few years back and all through Ohio it was 55 which is quite jarring when your used to doing 75/80 on the highways like i am. We get a good amount of people in MI who move in from other states which could explain why you see people driving 55mph here and there.
This is really the thing. I try not to use the horn unless it's absolutely necessary, like imminently dangerous situations. At that point, it's usually pretty obvious why it needed to be done. Instead, car horns are often used to convey an often nasty message. It's a sound that's designed to be irritating and loud, and it's supposed to inspire alarm, which later inspires anger.
Shitty old raps aren't much of an excuse either. If I can get my 8000lb 20 year old truck up to 60 in those ramps people can get there cars up to the same of faster. They are just worried about there fuel economy or think there car will break if the punch the throttle.
Only really works if you’re right behind them, if you’re 3 or 4 cars back you’re just screwed.
Got all the way over to left lane. Officer was behind a semi
Merging is definitely more challenging in metro Detroit traffic.
That’s is accurate, yes, you should be making the effort to get to speed.
Some dude who looked to be no more than mid 30s cruised, and I mean *cruised,* through an intersection the other day and nearly hit me. This is noteworthy because I had a green light and the light for the guy who was passing through the intersection had been red for long enough that I was the second car in line and the car in front of me had already safely gone through the light. 

To your point, awful driving knows no age.

Round-abouts are circles, with a yield sign, not a difficult shape to navigate.  Bike lanes, well, again, for bikes, not cars - share the road.  And cell phones, a no-no (for obvious reasons) while driving.  I suppose some people need education about these sorts of things, but for the rest of us, just use common sense.  Perhaps that's what's really missing.
Going 70 on the interstate isn't breaking the law though. One car going 55 with 200 others going 70 is the issue, not the rest. Legal or not, the outlier is the safety issue.
I used to drive a Pontiac Vibe and I’d be lucky to get up to 60 on those really short ones when flooring it.
Not if you have enough power.
I've seen some people both young and old with their phone in their hand holding it like their eating a pie and unaware of their speed and drifting on either side of their lanes.  I thought people would be used to using their bluetooth capability by now.

But you see people using their wireless headphones talking on the aisles and cashier area loudly.
This has been my thought as well. Younger people usually have faster reaction times, but not from what I've been seeing in some cases. Plus the on-ramp near me is in a town known for drug use.
Commone sense, courtesy and above all, situational awareness.
Like they’re eating a pie ☠️
I've been seeing the hold your phone in front of your face while talking on Bluetooth a lot recently.
Not an excuse on the bad driveing part but my car if I call out while driveing the hands free Bluetooth works perfectly. But if someone calls in it's a 40/50 shot if it works or I have to.pur them on speakerphone.
Thats the problem not many people have common sense and a very entitled attitude to things so dont think they should change cause its a everyone elses problem not me.
