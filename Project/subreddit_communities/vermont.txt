If you got a confederate flag on your truck we need to have words.
Muh heritage? Fuck boy, you born on the other side. 

I'm sick to death of all these pathetic plastic pavement princesses rolling around with enemy insignia. 

Please stop and have a word, or two.

If I had to choose two, it would be fuck, and you.
This post has broken r/vermont containment, and now we're getting an influx of random trolls, shit-stirrers, and the absolute dregs of neo-nazis and fascists of reddit; as such, I'm locking the post.

Agree! For people who are really into their heritage, they should fly the flag of the Vermont Republic (1777-1791). Much cooler than the Confederate flag anyway. It looks like stoned Betsy Ross designed it lol. I especially like the completely random star positions.
I agree.

Why the fuck would someone fly that flag in Vermont of all fucking places?

We were part of the underground railroad, fought confederate soldiers, and countless other things.

Also - the union won! Fuck off with that Confederate flag bullshit.
I saw this hot mess parked in front of the St. J post office once, and I thought it was the perfect metaphor:  an ideology that can't stand on its own two feet.

Well, it's easier to identify the clowns when they wear their suits. So you do have that.
I usually yell out my window "YOU GUYS LOST!"
The one thing I find odd in VT lately are all the Confederate flags I see. Isn't that offensive to people from here as there are many cemeteries around full of dead union soldiers from here? 

I saw one guy with one on his truck AND a support the troops sticker as well as a sticker for each military branch in the US!
Isn't that a huge contradiction?
*"Muh heritage..."* 

Yeah Cletus, "your heritage" lasted less than four years and ended 159 years ago. You also have precisely zero knowledge of any ancestors, 8 generations ago, that were actually involved in the fracas on either side. **-_-**
You really don't need to keep reporting this ‚Ä¶ it's staying up.

Fuck the Confederacy, fuck the traitor flag, fuck the "lost cause" bullshit. The only "cause" being fought for was white supremacy and the ownership of human beings, and that is an abhorrent thing to celebrate and fight for.
I'm from the South. The Confederate flag is embarrassing to me. The Civil War happened because half of America wanted to build its economy on the backs of enslaved humans. That's not heritage to be proud of.
Saw a confederate flag on a truck in a social security office parking lot in Vermont. Talk about not getting it.
In a way, I‚Äôm fine with it because I‚Äôd rather know upfront to steer clear of that person. I don‚Äôt engage with these people, but if you feel safe doing so, by all means.
A boy I went to high school with got it tattooed on his chest. He was born and raised here. What an embarrassment.
The Civil War was about slavery.  Every single declaration from every state that joined the Confederacy mentions slavery in the first paragraph.  Look up the historical documents. States rights, my ass.  That pathetic flag is the biggest participation trophy this country has ever seen.  Traitors.
Nice of them to identify themselves. Speaking of traitor flags, I tried to get some body work done on vehicles at a local shop. They kept putting me off for a couple years, saying things like "no openings, try us again in a month."

I pass by regularly and always see different cars/trucks. Meanwhile, I talk to someone at the hardware store who tells me about the nice work on their Subie. Just a day after a fender bender, their car was in there getting fixed. Hmms, I have to wonder if my Asian eyes inherited from my beautiful mom, rest in peace, are somehow the issue?

So I'm biking past this body shop soon after and saw my likely answer.  Parked proudly out front, parallel to the road was a General Lee-themed hotrod with the traitor flag on the door panels. Fresh wrapped, it sat out there a few days advertising their custom services. If the shop just flew that flag it could have saved me some time and frustration.
I am with you‚Äîanyone wearing, waving or carrying a confederate flag can go straight into the garbage can.
I grew up in the south and seeing this in VT makes me scratch my head.

I remember the first time we went to visit my parents, who had just moved to Mississippi. The next door neighbor had a yellow school bus on blocks in the front yard - yes, with one of those stupid flags proudly displayed flying from the rear of a non-functional bus from a non-functional school system. 

Why would anyone in Vermont want to be on team Mississippi??
Of all the Union states, Vermont lost the highest percentage of its population in the war. Flying the traitor flag here, of all places, is vile and beyond disrespectful. It is like taking a shit on Arlington Cemetery. I wonder if we could get a law passed banning the display of the traitor flag on public property in Vermont?
No different than flying the swastika in front of a synagogue. Sure, it‚Äôs your constitutional right, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt despise your ideology.
When I last visited Vermont (drove across the country from NW Arkansas) I was surprised at how many traitor flags I saw in upstate NY and all over Vermont. I hate seeing it here in Arkansas (where it is displayed on approximately 10% of homes), and I hated seeing it in Vermont too. I share in your disgust.

  
Sadly, the flag is a form of white-racist-bigoted pride, and that sentiment seems to be getting worse in our country.
I flew and wore the confederate flag when I was in middle school, I feel embarrassed knowing I supported it now. Don‚Äôt even remember why I did, bad family influence or something
We're the literal origin place of the term yankee. If you have a rebel rag than there's literally no other explanation than you're a racist. Vermont's had it's problems with bigotry but neo-confederate shit is especially egregious.
When I was in high school I was dumb enough to believe the whole "heritage not hate" thing and somewhere out there, my name on a petition to keep the Confederate flag from being banned at school. God, I was a moron. Now that my brain is fully developed, it's obvious that it's a diet-swastika these days but doesn't get the same reaction. White supremacists don't even try to hide their views
The other day I saw a dude in a sleeveless shirt with a tattoo on his upper arm that was a blended confederate and US flag draped from a staff, topped by a deer skull (Central VT). I just had to shake my head. Of course as George Santayana wrote ‚ÄòThose who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.‚Äô What that means to me in this context is that those of us who are anti-racist are in a war‚Äîrhetorical/intellectual at the moment‚Äîto remind the racists in our midst that their ideas are not welcome here.

still is in 2024.
I saw multiple Confederate flags on houses up around the Jay Peak area. My wife is from VT, but I‚Äôm from NC and we were visiting and it blew my mind that even in the brave little state there are confederate sympathizers that I‚Äôm sadly desensitized to seeing here down south. In NC, there is quite literally a 50ftx30ft Confederate flag that flies over I-40 on the way to Asheville. Disgusts me.
I once knew a guy who had one on his wall. He was born and raised in Vermont. Never left the state even. I asked him why he had it. His response? 

‚ÄúI like the way it looks‚Äù 
ü§®ü§®ü§®ü§®ü§®
It‚Äôs the loser flag. They lost. Whoever waves it likes waving flags of losers
These are people who will claim to be patriotic and love America, but literally fly the flag of people who tried to separate themselves from the country.

The math doesn‚Äôt math. Stupid does what stupid will, I suppose.
As a person from the deep south 

A: fuck these whiny idiots who don't know the difference between heritage and propaganda.

B: if you fly a rectangular battle flag of northern Virginia, you are simply saying your heritage is from the anti civil rights era when stupid racists bought reproduction flags to scare black people (the original flag was a square)

C: Southern states are by in large held captive by gerrymandering, boomers and silent generation racists who want things to go back to the way they were i.e. lead paint and lynchings. The overwhelming majority of young people are not in favor of racist policy or practice. It's the loud mouth idiots you hear, not the normal people who keep their mouths shut.

D: Please talk to these idiots and say this shit to their face, tell them they don't know their own history, their stupid little factory farms based on one of the worst ideas a human ever thought of failed over a century ago, and they are a disappointment to their heritage by living near all those yankees. Their bark is so loud, but 99% of them have no bite. (Do be careful engaging a large group, mob mentality can do crazy things) 

E: Seriously, find them, point at them, and laugh at them. They are a disappointment to human decency and progress.
It‚Äôs even more confusing when you see them up here in Canada‚Ä¶
The south will rise again.......cause shit floats!
Your heritage? My heritage is burning anything a Confederate flag is attached to.
I started flying a union flag. 
https://www.ww2gear.com/image/popup?imagePath=%2fimages%2fproduct%2flarge%2f26-801528.jpg&altText=MzQgU3RhciBVbmlvbiBGbGFnIC0gMTg2Mw2
I grew up in a part of VT where you‚Äôd see this stuff.  Unfortunately seems to have spread. To me these people are the ones that had the Calvin pissing on Ford stickers or truck balls or whatever offensive, stupid thing they‚Äôd found at the store.

Maybe it‚Äôs naive but I never really took it as they knew and ascribed to the ideology. Perhaps had a general idea that it‚Äôs a symbol of the south and ‚Äúwhite pride‚Äù but not much more beyond that. I felt it‚Äôs more so that when regular minded people are like ‚Äúwhat the fuck do you have on your truck?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong with you?‚Äù They can then have a confrontation. 

I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs wrong to confront them or to have an issue with it. It‚Äôs stupid. And ignorant. Just that it‚Äôs a intentional means to confrontation. These are the guys that punched me in the stomach on the playground. Dumb and potentially violent.
Fellas with that flag on your truck, I meant what I said, we need to have words. I'll meet you. You will be convinced. Anywhere in Bennington County.
I think most folks who have confederate flag stickers on their vehicles are ignorant about what it actually stands for because they think it‚Äôs just some symbolism of being redneck and country
I always found it funny that the side which claims to be the real patriots is also the side which openly supports the most notorious traitors in the nation's history. The cherry on top is when somebody thinks they are making a good point by pointing out that the conservative south called themselves democrats back then, as if it has anything to do with the modern parties and their names. The mental gymnastics and hypocrisy is insane.
‚ÄúMy heritage has a tradition of killing those who fly the confederate flag‚Äù
I‚Äôm y‚Äôall‚Äôs neighbor (originally from Boston). And I highly agree ‚Äî when I see this flag on trucks in western mass, Vermont or somewhere I‚Äôm like‚Ä¶ dude, fuckin why?
They're just racist. That's really the long and short of it.
If I see a person with a confederate flag I think of them the same way I think of a person sporting a swastika or the hammer and sickle. 

I don‚Äôt hate you, but I don‚Äôt trust you and I don‚Äôt want to hang out with you.
The American swastika
I watched an older episode of Unsolved mysteries recently, think it was early 90‚Äôs based on fashion. Guy being interviewed had an enormous confederate flag in his wall that was not part of the story or acknowledged. At least we have come to a place where TV shows will find a less racist background for interviews, I guess?
Treason Flag*
The stars and bars is a treasonous rag
I don't have a problem with them supporting their heritage tbh. If they want to fly a flag saying they're irredeemably racist and an absolute fucking loser, so be it.
There were confederate sympathizers in union states.  Ain‚Äôt nothing new.  At least the enemy can be identified.
From what I know of Vermont it is one of the freest states in the Nation.  You do not have to have a permit to carry a firearm and are free to walk around in your birthday suit if it pleases you.

Try walking around in the nude in 90% of the other states and see where you wind up.  While 29 other states also do not require a license to carry a firearm (at the minute) Vermont was the first state to have constitutional carry.

What do they have to bitch about?
That flag has no business being flown anywhere really, but it especially confuses me when people do it in the northern union states. 

2 summers ago I drove across South Dakota twice. There was not a single time that I saw a Trump flag without an accompanying ‚ÄúStars and bars.‚Äù  Just sickening.
But....but....but..... Heritage!  Well, it's my heritage to burn your city to the ground as I march to the sea but you don't see me advertising that.
If they were celebrating their heritage they probably should use a flag that actually existed during the civil war.
Imagine driving around with an image of Benedict Arnold emblazoned on your vehicle or flying a flag with his face on it...yeah, you'd look fucking stupid.
People think VT is so open minded & liberal but they don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs really full people like this.  Confederate flag owners, racists, homophones & just a LOT of ignorance all around.  (I‚Äôm gay so I 100% know it‚Äôs true from very personal experience, all the time)
The Traitor-loser flag. The "I hate America" flag
I avoid Castleton for this reason. Only place in VT I‚Äôve ever seen confederate flags. I know it‚Äôs rural, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you are in the south.
I'm from Mississippi, and they're becoming a rarer and rarer sight there.  I'm so puzzled when I see them up north.  Like, especially if the person waving it around isn't from or connected to the south in any way.  In any case, it should be a white flag.  They surrendered.  I don't care about their heritage (of hate) or what they claim they were fighting for (states' rights to do *what*?), they are choosing to fly the flag of a traitorous movement that fought for slavery, and that lasted for a pathetically short time before surrendering and its cause going underground.   And wanna know who took up that cause and resisted integration and reconstruction?  The KKK.  If you fly the confederate flag and claim that heritage, you're boasting about what most 1800s racists would only do with bedsheets over their heads.  


Also, as a reminder, here are some things that managed to last longer than the confederacy:

- Ghostbusters Cereal

- The Microsoft Zune

- Doritos Locos Tacos 

- The Obama administration

- MySpace

- The War in Iraq and the War in Afghanistan

     - (racists sweating as they realize that the Taliban not only won their civil war, but is only a couple of years away from their *second* government outlasting the confederacy just like their first one did, and that the Taliban is literally just living their shitty theocratic fascist dreams) 

- Pokemon Go

- The MCU

- My phone number

- legal gay marriage in the US
I kinda like it.  You know straight away the type of person they are so you can avoid them without having to engage.  Plus it's fun to point and laugh at them.
Self-identify as a racist loser.
It annoys me more these people fly the Confederate Naval Jack rather than the battle flag they think they are.
Because American public and even private education is shiiiiiiiit
They want to piss people off - someone to rail against. They probably didn‚Äôt even become ‚Äúconfederate‚Äù til the 2016 election.
Us Vermonters can‚Äôt even make a case that it‚Äôs ‚Äúheritage‚Äù because we were nowhere close to being a confederate state. In fact, the only time we involved ourselves in the civil war was to fight AGAINST the confederacy. I think the reason why a lot of snowflake conservatives in our state fly their confederate flags is by means of being a rebuttal to BLM flags being flown. A ‚Äúyou be exclusive I‚Äôll be exclusive‚Äù type situation, even though if you rubbed two brain cells together and started a fire, you‚Äôd see that BLM isn‚Äôt saying ‚Äúonly Black Lives Matter‚Äù but rather ‚Äúour lives haven‚Äôt mattered as much as yours.‚Äù The reality is right in front of their faces but they just aren‚Äôt willing to see it.
But you don‚Äôt really. At some point you just need to not give af about other people
that and these ridiculous III stickers everywhere

some weird spartan cosplay or some shit?
Knew someone from Vermont who looked down on how backwards people in the South were. They held a BLM protest at their rural Vermont college and good ol boys showed up with Confederate flags on their trucks. Really eye opening experience for them.
Michigander here, and we see these the further you get from cities. 

My brother started using the flag to show that he identified as a 'rebel', independent and living by his own rules.

I told him that was a perfectly fine lifestyle, but he's using the flag of a **loser** who got told what to do by the North something fierce to showcase that he's independent. The math didn't add up, and on top of that, it makes people think he hates them.

He heard me out, thought momentarily, and then agreed and took the flag down. I didn't yell at him or anything; just used my rational voice and asked him to think for a minute.

Now, he just focuses on the Harley Davidson "I'm independent" message, and I'm fine with that.
I lived in Pittsburgh in an area that was predominantly Black and some a-hole would drive around with a HUGE confederate flag flowing in the wind. It absolutely blew my mind that someone had that kind of audacity. Also, the very definition of f*ck around and find out.
Live in Ga. they are the proudest losers in the history of man‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ except for Germans
I see a few on my normal commute, not just trucks but I'm pretty sure I've seen an SUV and car with a rebel rag front license plate. It's kinda nice when losers identify themselves from a distance. 

It would be cool to see more of these [bad](https://gettysburg.stonesentinels.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/13VT-4c_2062.jpg) [boys](https://gettysburg.stonesentinels.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Vermont-4c_2068.jpg) around instead.
Get one of those Calvin pissing stickers and casually put it above the flag.
Recently saw a sticker on a truck:

*PATRIOT!* in an edgy font over a confederate flag background. 

You can‚Äôt make this stuff up.
Go to the state fair in Rutland and they have all kinds of confederate flag stuff for sale.  Like wtf?
Losers
Read the Confederate Constitution, it says the quietly racist part out loud.
Ever go to rural New Hampshire? It‚Äôs the Deep South of the north
These types usually talk a good game about supporting the military and veterans, yet they disrespect the veterans buried in nearly every Vermont town that defended America in the Civil War.
They sure do love to wave their treason participation ribbons.
I had a fraternity brother who pinned a confederate flag in the hallway outside his room. And in hindsight, I really regret not putting a stop to that.

Idk why, but at 19, I don't think it properly registered what kind of statement he was making by doing that - I just thought it was weird and ignored it. And even in hindsight, my house wasn't a bunch of racists - we had a couple guys who were problematic out of like 90+, but to our shame, we didn't set them straight like we should have. We even had a couple of black brothers at the time. I don't think they felt like turning it into a big fight - but I can't imagine they felt good about it being posted in a  common area of the house they were living in.
[removed]
>Muh heritage?

Always makes me laugh because the confederacy existed for all of 4 years.
It was so common in Brattleboro during the 90s. Their team is the Rebels and a bunch of them would have Confederate flags and bumper stickers that said "Pride of the South."
I live in Franklin county and it‚Äôs everywhere. For a long time there was a house on Main Street in Enosburg that had a giant one, proudly displayed.
When you got Cs in High School and are punching the clock in your repetitive task wage slave job, it‚Äôs your symbol of rebellion against the system.   Same as a Trump sign on your lawn or a red MAGA hat.   Half the country got Cs in High School and have mind numbing repetitive task jobs.   It‚Äôs why populists get all those votes.  All the resentment.
Maybe their ancestors checked out a bank in St. Albans, looked around, liked what they saw and stayed?


/s, obviously.
The wording on this is spectacular lmao
They think they're owning the libs, but they're really just showing us that they're proud of losing.
If you fly that flag in Vermont, you are cowardly saying ‚ÄúI hate black people.‚Äù So yes, fuck you. Your ancestors also, btw, think you are a piece of shit. 

Looking at you, Route 11 outside Chester.
Make racists afraid again. You get rid of racists by letting them know their bullshit won't be tolerated. You get rid of them by letting them know there's consequences for being bigots. They may be toddlers having a temper tantrum to some of you but as an immigrant, as a queer woman, as a person of color, these people are deadly serious to me. I've had people like this lay hands on me and threaten to kill me multiple times. So yeah, the confede-nazis deserve no tolerance. They are not all talk, they just don't harm you because you aren't the object of their hatred.
I will openly smack the shit out of anyone i see flying that in Connecticut. Thems is fighting images. I‚Äôve had to rip them down a few times. People here get a little too comfy with their hate. My daughter is inspired too, she wanted to tear down peoples trump signs so I took her. Still not back up and they will only be for a few hours it‚Äôs right on our street. Hate isn‚Äôt allowed around here. We will fight you. And we‚Äôre stronger. Hate gets stomped out we don‚Äôt have discussions. We don‚Äôt respect your hate. We just overpower it and dominate you. This is why Connecticut is such a diverse and amazing place. Come walk downtown New Haven you‚Äôve never seen anything like it where you‚Äôre from. We don‚Äôt have big problems with racism and hate here, because we don‚Äôt allow it. We all stomp it out in our own way. Magnet schools are big here. We integrate as kids. My friends were of all races. We never learned to hate. So when we see it, we treat it like a spider in the house, and stomp it to death.
You have MAGA to thank for that.  Like the idiot carrying the rebel flag thru Congress.
So‚Ä¶when you see them‚Ä¶have words
The original loser logo, often paired with the 21st century one: Trump shit.
So, not to sound like a dick, but did we really win when we stopped the south from seceding? Imagine how much better the US would be if we got rid of most of the states south of the Mason-Dixon?
30 years ago if you came to Vermont with a Confederate flag decal on your truck window one of the many liberals with an arsenal that makes the federal government nervous would have "removed" the window and added a bunch of "ventilation holes" to your truck body.
It‚Äôs ‚Äúmuh Hurtage‚Äù
I drive by one in Lyndonville and cringe at the sight of it.
Imma just fly a Caesars flag from Fallout New Vegas, it's the same thing pretty much
I drive by a house with one hanging over a window. I just want to throw a rock through it every time i pass
Be sure to tell anyone waving one of these flags to go back to their own country. Oh, wait... it doesn't exist!
They‚Äôre all over upstate NY too. News flash assholes: you prob had relatives that fought on the Union side.
If they want to openly announce they are racist assholes, you should be thanking them. It really helps you to focus your goodwill on people that matter.
At least they announce themselves. These guys (if you‚Äôre a guy) or ladies (if you‚Äôre a lady) are *suuuuper* fun to hit on in public and wink at and such.
Far right extremist political organizations in **other countries** fly the stars and bars, to include Australia, Argentina, and the UK. 

It was never about heritage
I had ancetral men on both sides of the war, and there is no way I am claiming that flag as part of "muh heritage."  The Rebel was from Pennsylvania, too.  

It just astounds.
Nowadays people running the confederate flag is ultimately about triggering people. Thats it.
And they always bring up "It wasn't about slavery, state rights over federal?" State rights to do what?
I find it especially confusing when I find someone living in Saint Albans doing this, where there‚Äôs a green historical plaque stating how the only attack in New England was when a group of confederates came down from Quebec and raided banks and killed a person. They literally attacked you and saw you as an enemy.
Living on the border between VT and NH is interesting because you spend most of your time in one of the most left leaning states there is, and then you cross the river and the bank behind the ice cream stand is covered in manic DEMS 4 CHINA and STOP THE STEAL signs >.>
 Lol you should take a trip to northern California.
Slavers.
üî• Plastic pavement princessesüî•
There is no point in arguing or trying to ‚Äúconvert‚Äù the enemy. They don‚Äôt see it as an enemy flag simple as that. They don‚Äôt even know what the flag stands for. 

When you‚Äôve been brainwashed your entire life and someone tells you you‚Äôre wrong you don‚Äôt concede, you defend. Trying to reason with these people just force them in their shell. 

It‚Äôs basic tribalism. It‚Äôs not about being right, correct, or even proper. It‚Äôs about not letting the other team or allowing them to progress. It‚Äôs human nature.
I had a hot sauce company from 2013 to 2018. I got put next to those belt buckle, blanket and teeshirt booths a lot. The amount of white kids in new england that would buy confederate belt buckles, hats, blankets and merch was unreal. I asked the other vendor if that was his best seller jokingly and he said ‚Äúabsolutely. It‚Äôs the first design to sell out every time‚Äù

The flag vendor said the same thing. People in ct/mass/ny/vt fairs love buying confederate flags for whatever reason.

I wonder if it‚Äôs just kids thinking it‚Äôs edgy or the taboo factor, but it‚Äôs really awkward to watch someone order a king sized fuzzy blanket with a huge confederate flag on it
How often do you see this?


I haven't seen a single once since moving back to Texas over a year ago. I don't recall seeing one for year before that.¬†


You guys actually see this irl?
That and the desecrated American flags are near as bad. Same dumbass mindset but more cowardly.
They like to race thru neighborhoods throwing crap. Neighbors son got hit by a glass bottle thrown at a group of boys walking home from school. Truck was covered with Trump stickers and a huge Trump flag. The boys were 8-12 years old, just happy little kids walking the 2 blocks home.

Took 12 stitches to close the wound.

This is not the first time this has happened
The fact this is in Vermont is confusing. Doesn't make any sense.
Word. Feel the same for just about any flag that isn‚Äôt a state or USA flag.
Why don‚Äôt you say this to them instead of reddit
There‚Äôs only one flag that flies above the rest
Some of us remember the St. Albans Raid happened. Also Vermont was a republic for longer than the confederacy existed, obviously not at the same time.
It‚Äôs the flag of losers and traitors to the United States of America. 
The only good thing about people flying it is that it‚Äôs a good warning to stay away from them, and also to never hire them.
Sherman should have never stopped burning the South and more traitors should have been hanged.

They can go live in Florida.
Can't fix stupid and we've got plenty of that around here.
If they could only hold onto their teeth the same way they hold onto this flag. The Confederate flag is a symbol that comes with the understanding that if you support it, you support Jim Crowe laws and suppression of blacks and minorities.
I had an American flag on my push cart at work and one guy says "now you just need a confederate flag, too" 

I said "yeah, while we're at it i could also maybe get an ISIS flag" 

He said "whaddya mean? They're nothing alike" 

I said "yeah i guess you're right. ISIS existed for a longer time, but the confederates killed more Americans, by far" 

The blank, braindead look on his face said it all
‚ÄúMuh heritage‚Äù your heritage is losing‚Ä¶ literally
I wouldn't say anything to them. 

I'd write down their license plate, then look up their address, and then send them Floridian real estate brochures.

The way to defeat racism in Vermont is not through confrontation, but through subterfuge, concern trolling, and slick marketing campaigns.

We should use marketing and sales techniques to convince racists that they are happier in the South.
Get a few stickers off the 20th of Maine flag and whenever you see it as a confederate flag bumper sticker, slap the Maine flag over it.
Because they want attention. They feel invisible and any attention makes them feel important.
It takes a certain mentality to embrace the Confederate flag.  These people choose their method of performative rebellion against society by aligning themselves with a racist, seditious movement that was eliminated almost 200 years ago.  Much like MAGA swag, it lets you know that the person is racist, bigoted, homo-and-transphobic and likely woefully ill-informed, thought they can probably repeat all the current extremist right-wing talking points they get from Fox or OAN or whatever.
As someone from VA. We also don‚Äôt like these type of people. It isn‚Äôt really a south and north thing, more like just a idiot thing.
It has nothing to do with the actual confederacy, it just means "I am republican".

Unfortunately, a significant % of Americans have been led so far astray that they are never coming back. It is in no way an exaggeration to say Trumpism has become a full-on cult. His followers will turn their back on their friends, family, and country before they turn their back to him.
It just shows they are some of the biggest losers around flying the flag of the all time biggest losers
My favorite is when they have both a confederate flag and an American flag. Like they have no idea that those two ideologies were at war‚Ä¶
I am from the south. It's treason. It's hate. Every one of the "my heritage" people are racist or tolerates it. I grew up with these people. All over the south. They can wink and smirk at someone who didn't live in their world. I did.

You fly that flag, and you are a traitor who supports racism. Period. 

Don't play their games. They rely on people's reluctance to call it out.
Its is ignorant to fly that flag. But I really doubt you would do anything about it face to face. Reddit muscles. lol
It was never about the heritage, it's about the racism.
Also the confederacy only lasted 4 years. That is it
There's this one house in Alburgh that I always pass going to NY with a big fat rebel flag on it. I always flip that place off, fuck that guy

I like your style
Ah yes Vermont, the land of more BLM signs than actual black people
To the folks saying this is just to get attention, I think I have to disagree. At this point in our cultural evolution as a country, it‚Äôs an explicit and intentional statement of prejudice and racism.
It's branding these people wanna feel like the strength they project into those beliefs instead of just being strong through actions
Descendants of the Glorious Dead. 

Still assholes.
Born and raised in western New York‚Ä¶ it was sad to see this tradition carried on to my generation and young folks are still flying it proudly
I‚Äôm not American let alone from Vermont, I don‚Äôt get how many confederate flag flyers think they are more patriotic than not‚Ä¶ they lost the civil war ffs AGAINST THE US! it‚Äôs almost like flying a Vietnamese flag and saying ‚Äúlook how patriotic I am‚Äù
I mean, sure I‚Äôm not from the south. But what if my heritage is just ‚Äúbeing racist‚Äù? You tellin me I can‚Äôt celebrate that without upsetting people?

/sarcasm
Obligatory "Not a Vermonter". But at least where I live, we had a bunch of people from the South migrate over the course of a century or so after the war in order to get those good manufacturing jobs as subsistence farming became economically unviable. So I always know there's a chance that people flying those flags migrated here from their shithole home states and then tried to make our state more of a shithole. But at the same time, it's always fun to bring up the fact that a lot of stuff around us is named after officers of the 4th Michigan Cavalry Regiment which was responsible for the capture of Jefferson Davis after the war as he was trying to flee to Mexico; or the fact that Benjamin D. Pritchard is buried about one county down from us.

Ok.  As an outsider who happened on this post I will tell you why.  Various groups, gangs, clubs, lone wolf's that are racist as fuck LOVE VERMONT because they can still buy guns way after blue states say no way and they can get them quicker.  I bet half of them run guns to blue states.
Only someone who would never do anything about it in person would create this post.
It's called the rebel flag for a distinct reason and people will fly it in far away places like Scotland and Norway; it's also a Christian flag with the cross of Saint Andrew on it and thus it further resonates with the christian(especially protestant) conservative types. 

In addition to this people will simply fly it for shock value and to piss people off because they're sadists; when you feed them your angry emotions you're giving them exactly what they want and you're being played like a fiddle.
This is one of the facts I share w people about Maine and NH to people in the state I live in now when I talk about home lol (from MA)
People like that are not typically good with words. Or hygiene. Or life in general.
When we lived in Tennessee I noticed that trucks flying that flag often also had a MAGA-related flag.  Tennessee has a large number of specialty license plate options, and vehicles with confederate or Tr\*\*p 2024 flags or stickers often had the Gadsden flag license plate.

So how's life in Vermont?

Some stable, reasonable folks may need a place to live.
I view it as sign that their parents are related and they're a dangerous animal that needs to be avoided.
lol
Ask them if they support the confederate history, why are they not flying the right flag? 

The closest to it was the Naval Jack, and the colors were different. The rest were square battle flags. NONE of them were the actual flag of the confederacy. HERITAGE!!!

Alright, you get one word.
I'd be curious why they have it on there, but they have that right. If you looking to use force you are no better than any other authoritarian thug out there. Free speech matters when you don't agree with people not when everyone says and believes the same thing.
Wow sounds like a blast to live in Vermont
Have words with them then. Nobody is stopping you. You say you see so many, you're gonna be having a lot of words for people.

Do you feel the same way about all the college students and hired protesters and their Hamas support?  If not, you're just another blowhard hypocrite.

Yeah, I get the hate and rightfully so.  But we live in a democracy and freedom of speech is key.  If the guy didn't have the flag on the side of his truck it wouldn't change his attitude/beliefs. It's good to know where he's coming from in advance.  

I'm not a Trump fan (or Biden) either, but people should be allowed to have their own beliefs even if they contradict ours.  To force our beliefs on others undermines democracy.
Freedom of expression.  You don‚Äôt have to agree with it but it‚Äôs still a right people have.
If i had to choose it would be fuck and you. Do i have to send royalties everytime I steal that?? thats amazing lol
I don‚Äôt agree with what the flag represents. But I agree you face the right to fly it.
Is this really a big problem in Vermont?  üòÇ
I believe in free speech.

I will fight for your right to say things I don‚Äôt agree with.

That flag just means Republican now. The civil war never ended it just quieted down.¬†
OP is such an internet tough guy lol
I actually don't know what is worse the idiots with a flag or the idiots that get so bent out of shape about a flag. You're giving them the attention and the reaction they want. Good job. If everyone would just mind their own business these guys would eventually fade away because nobody would be noticing them.
*stoned Betsy Ross* lmao
I have one on my wall lol. I hate that the movement for the second Vermont republic co-opted it since they are conservative nut jobs but I love my Vermont republic flag.
I love this so much!
Green Mountain boys and the Vermont independence movement screw the federal government.

https://vermontindependent.net
Broooooo. My eyes. How could you do this. Please fix the stars.
Additionally, Vermont was the first state to outlaw slavery.
Vermont was a republic 10 years longer than that puny confederacy and you don't see us crying about bullshit like "heritage".
Be sure to inform them they aren't even flying the correct [flag](https://i.imgur.com/KSa1MZh.jpeg). üè≥
The South lost. Slavery lost. Racism lost.

It is literally a symbol you put on your vehicle, body, or place of residence to state ‚ÄúI am a loser.‚Äù

Like bright colors in nature that warn us of the presence of venom, or in the case of the aggressive black and white striping of a skunk, an awful stink, I view the Confederate Flag as a sign that I should avoid an unpleasant encounter.
It‚Äôs meant to trigger people
Thank you! It's about as far from the confederacy as you could get, but I still see these dumbshits flying that flag.

GTFO of my state with that bullshit.

The state motto is Freedom and Unity. Speaks for itself.
Because they are racist fucks.
A guy in my neighborhood used to fly the confederate flag. He said he flew it because he was originally from Mississippi and wanted to celebrate his time from Mississippi. My point was that I‚Äôd be more likely to believe that bullshit if he ever embraced other more palatable aspects of southern living. If he was planting hardy magnolia trees in his yard, inviting neighbors over for some southern BBQ, sharing copies of William Faulkner‚Äôs works, playing some classic soul music. There are a ton of ways to embrace southern culture that has nothing to do with the civil war and continuing racism. Flying the confederate flag is the worst way to do it.
Ahh flag draggers the people who need you to know they are a mentally deficient loser form as far away as possible, virtue signaling a lack of virtue, giving themselves the I'd ideological reach around no body else will give them. my favorite is when they drag the American flag around behind them in the rain to show how much more they love America than the rest of us, by desecrating it. we got it you jerk happy to kick your Confederate ass again anytime you want
Absolute ignorance, stupidity, and a pathological need to trigger libruls that you don‚Äôt quite understand but is cool in your Facebook groups
Robert E Lee conceded and the Confederate flag was revived by the Dixiecrats as Segregational symbolism.

Just like the KKK

Why you would embolden the dark past of Traitorism and firmly entrenched racism of the past? Just shows the "age of information" failed millions of people.
I went to Maine for a work event and saw a dude wearing the stars and bars on a jacket as he bicycled up the road.

I would never condone violence but I'm surprised someone from Maine who knows a little history, didn't clip him.
Drive through central Maine üòÇ A lot of Confederate flags and signs that say ‚ÄúThe South will rise again!‚Äù Swear these people don‚Äôt know whats what.
Whaaaa'!? But what about mAh RiGhTs (to own slaves)!?

/s
Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong. The South lost. Why the fuck would someone be so proud of losing?
its the same jackasses that claim to support the troops. always a fun fact asking them that question, then asking why theyre flying the flag of someone who killed 360k of our troops. its like flying an isis flag
Because fuck you, your feels hot hurt so that's their goal. 


Most people also fly the wrong Confederate flag.
From NC just popping in to say I 100% agree with your sentiment. I got family in Indiana, I see motherfuckers flying it there too. It‚Äôs baffling.
>Why the fuck would someone fly that flag in Vermont of all fucking places?

  
There are plenty of examples in the Ohio subreddit as well, and Ohio wasn't part of the Confederacy, either.
Hijacking the top comment to inquire if there are any Pantera/Dimebag Darrell fans in the theater tonight?

Get 'em up against the wall!
Dude it‚Äôs not even just a Vermont thing. I live in Minnesota, literally the first state to send union volunteers, and these dingbats still fly confederate flags on the back of the truck. Hell I even had a neighbor flying one next door growing up. I really don‚Äôt get it, it‚Äôs generally not even southern people from what I‚Äôve seen so they can‚Äôt even try and portray it as some southern pride thing. Though that argument would also fall flat pretty quick
Why the fuck do they fly it in Indiana? I grew up around it in Arkansas, but it blows my mind to see it north of the mason dixon.
There are pics from the BLM/Covid years from damn Hawaii of trucks flying that flag.
I travel around the country for work. The place I see the most confederate flags is Maryland. Always makes me laugh/cry.
I've seen them in the backs of windows or flown outside of homes here....*in Michigan*. Like, do these rubes even *know* Michigan history? Heard of the Michigan Brigade from the Civil War? Sometimes called the Wolverines?

From Wikipedia:
> Composed primarily of the 1st Michigan Cavalry, 5th Michigan Cavalry, 6th Michigan Cavalry and 7th Michigan Cavalry, **the Michigan Brigade fought in every major campaign of the Army of the Potomac from the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863 to the Confederate surrender at Appomattox Court House in April 1865.**

But yeah, let's fly the Confederate flag here in Michigan. That'll show em!
The confederacy is less a part of our heritage than McDonald‚Äôs
The other side won is the weakest argument for the whole thing and sort of undermines the point.
Apparently, just to piss you off.

Sounds like they‚Äôve succeeded.
Maybe they're just some good old boys, never meaning no harm.
This is exactly the type of mfer I'm talking about. Sick of this shit in our state.

I'd be happy to provide that driver with a compass. You wanna rep the south? Then fucking live there, easy win. Go own the libs by getting hookworm in Georgia or some shit.

Golly gee, I wonder which candidate he'll be voting for?

Did you knife his tires? You shouldve knifed his tires.
It's always a truck
That‚Äôs always been my argument for this kind of free speech. First, if you only have acceptable free speech then you don‚Äôt have free speech. Second, I‚Äôd rather an asshole be allowed to demonstrate they are an asshole rather than secretly be an asshole. If we banned the confederate flag he isn‚Äôt suddenly going to be magically not-racist. He‚Äôs just harder to spot.
Hahaha the flag of ‚Äúlosers‚Äù that‚Äôs a great spin to use. Go straight for the ego.
It's really strange that people speak about The Civil War (I prefer The Slaveholders Rebellion) in terms of Union vs. Confederate. 

It makes it sound as if the Conferates fought something else, some other Army that sprouted from the pages of William Lloyd Garrison's The Liberator. This hides the fact that the Slaveholders and those who joined them fought against the United States.

We are talking about the United States Army and the United States Navy. Each is the one and only of ita kind in the United States.
Same and it‚Äôs disgusting. I‚Äôm utterly sick of seeing this flag and the mentality that goes with it. 

OP is correct: it‚Äôs extra pathetic and fucked up
In a Union state.
I love the clip going around the internet of the bigger dude holding a confederate flag and defending it, saying ‚Äúthis is the flag my family stood under for years!‚Äù When the crowd around him asked why he supported slavery, he replied ‚Äúmy family didn‚Äôt have slaves! Do you know how much a slave cost back then?!‚Äù

The conservative nut jobs probably loved it thinking he ‚Äúowned the libs‚Äù. But in reality, thinking it‚Äôs ok to rep the confederate flag in 2024 because your family was simply too poor to afford a slave is an absolutely ridiculous concept.
Also from the south. Went up to the Northeast (Mass, Vermont, Maine, NH) was blown away how many confederate flags I saw. Honestly more than I see usually driving around North Alabama.
Yeah that's fair. I got three kids and when they see some dumb mfer with a Confederate flag flapping behind their truck they know to steer clear.
I get where you're coming from and agree to some extent, but on the other hand I'll never be "fine" with displays of bigotry
Its literally a red flag
I'm always afraid I'm going to meet somebody, have a few things in common, maybe want to hang out a bit... they see their car plastered with MAGA and these stupid flags.  

It is a 100% turn and walk the other way situation.  YES, I am judging you.
[deleted]
Also the people defending the confederate flag belong there, too.
When I was a teen in the 80's, I don't recall the confederate flag having the same connotation.  If someone had a confederate flag on display it usually was some edgy teen trying to advertise their rebellious nature.  You had the General Lee screaming around on TV with it emblazoned across the roof ... nobody gave it a second thought as a symbol of hate.  Yes ... they were from the south, but plenty of us Northerners kind of identified with those "Good ol' Duke boys fighting the system".

Nowadays, it's definitely changed and taken on a more sinister and hateful meaning.  Anybody flying those colors today and doesn't recognize that it's now a symbol of racism and hate has had their head in the sand for the last 15 years or so.
Totally agree.  My great great grandfather led the Irish regiment out of Boston and died on the battle field.  I‚Äôm getting a union flag and F anyone who flies the confederate flag.  My families blood was spilled for the union.  If you fly a confederate flag you are a traitor.
The hard part is that Trump caters to these folks and they behave like a big mean cult.  So no matter what I feel on any other issues I have to vote against Trump.  That means I have to vote for a candidate with a reasonable chance of winning.  I‚Äôm sick of people describing the election as a Trump camp vs Biden camp thing like a football game.  For me it‚Äôs anyone who will beat Trump since he is the ‚Äúhate‚Äù candidate and encourages racism.  But it‚Äôs not just racism, it‚Äôs fascist rhetoric that he is pushing.  Lately he is describing building a new Reich.  So he‚Äôs super into Nazis too.  We literally fought wars against the confederacy and against the Nazis so anyone celebrating them is a traitor.  End of story.
Rhetorical at the moment indeed. It's just, we are all getting a little frustrated by the illiteracy on the other side, and they're clearly chomping at the bit tor a proper shootout. 

I just wish they'd read the goddamn book they keep throwing at everyone else (the new testament) and then maybe all this could be avoided.
That's just dodging the confrontation. I say the same thing when someone asks about aesthetic choices that I make which really do have meaning, but I don't want to argue over. It's all about picking fights, and they knew they'd lose.
Well done!
How about a T-shirt with that flag and the caption ‚ÄúThe Winning Side‚Äù or something to that effect?
That's exactly it, you nailed it. Dumb and looking for confrontation.

I hate bullies, always have.
My nephew is one of these types, dumb and mean. When he got his first car years ago, he put and ‚ÄòAdam and Eve, not Adam and Steve‚Äô as was popular in the 90‚Äôs. The thing is my mother (his grandmother) is gay. She said to him, ‚ÄúWhy do you have that sticker?‚Äù His reply was ‚ÄúOh, I don‚Äôt mean you, gramma‚Äù

Um, what? Yes, he‚Äôs got the confederate flag nowadays. SMH
They‚Äôre truck nutz not truck balls, but I still see and agree with your point
Oh stop with the chest puffing bullshit. I couldn‚Äôt agree more about the confederate flag but you dont need to go threatening to kick Reddit‚Äôs ass.

The hammer and sickle is not equivalent to those other two.
I have family outside of Atlanta. They call it the Southern Swastika.
So much so that in countries where it‚Äôs illegal to display a swastika it has become a common stand in.
I have heard it was the ‚ÄòBattle Flag‚Äô.
I am a loyal Yankee, and don‚Äôt like that flag. It doesn‚Äôt impress me!
But if you want to use it on your own property, that‚Äôs your right!
And if you are one of the fools who want to succeed again, try really hard to concentrate and remember how it worked out last time for the rebels!
Eye here ewe. Seaing mails around hear with hateful flags on there trucks makes me want to give them a peace of my mined. Wear are they're white robes?  Give me a brake!

Dam homophones!

/s

Couldn't resist the irony that these pea-brained homophobes probably couldn't identify a homophone.
The voting records disagree with you. I will say though, the fewer bigots there are, the louder they seem to get. It's exhausting.
It's legit 50/50. 

Half my town is old, liberal hippies and young progressive folks and the other half is afraid 5G is going to put covid in their brains.
Aw, come on - homophones are cool.  :)
Much of the state is what I would consider either "old school" Republican (fiscal conservatism, small gov't., etc...), or even more Libertarian.

Vermont _definitely_ has a history of racism (though not slavery) and xenophobia, and many of those old-timers definitely aren't interested in progressive policies.  A certain amount of that comes from the fact that there just historically _haven't_ been a lot of people of color in Vermont ... as much of an accident of history as it is anything else ... the place was settled by white people and there was never a concerted effort to "import" people from other places.  In a place that isn't too keen on outsiders, a person of color is easily identified as someone "not from around here" and draws a fair bit of unwanted attention. 

That said _most_ of them just want to be left alone to do their own thing with as little governmental intervention as possible.  They're "good fences make good neighbors" type people who are perfectly happy to pay no attention to what's happening on your side of the fence, so long as you stay the heck away from their side. (Unless you get your car stuck in a ditch, then every neighbor around is showing up with tractors and yank straps to help you out).

These folks probably aren't flying flags and drawing attention to themselves, but they're also not voting for social programs and increased school funding.

The liberal veneer that Vermont has, largely came out of the 60's and 70's where lots of hippy-dippy folks were looking for a place to live their alternative lifestyles and they found abundant, cheap land available in VT.  They were young, politically active, voted like their lives depended on it and made a lot of impact on Vermont's political landscape.
Plus its funny all of the keyboard warrior comments, go tell them. 
I have, I banned the flag and any other flag that isnt the American flag from being flown as president of my hoa.
It sure is funny how many people have not "whooped the dog shit" out of me. They typically log into a neighbor chat forum and cry to people that don't care. Then they get mad that people don't care about them crying so they are here. 
Losers.
Oh, same stupid shit at South Burlington High School back in the day.  They rebranded as the Wolves a while ago but they used to be the Rebels.  Team colors were light blue, grey and white.  It was the most confused shit in the world.  And of course half the football players, many of whom were intelligent and not racist, would fly the stars and bars as a team logo.  Used to hate that shit.
A business near us put up a trump flag and I thought "why would you want to piss off half of your potential customers before they even walk in the door ".. They closed up about a month afterwards.
Little do they know, they got Cs and passed high school because the teachers knew there was no point making them repeat grades.
This is the only comment in this entire post that even comes close to describing this.
Lmaooo
Raw statistics agree with you, but there is a humanitarian angle to consider. Some people just have the rotten luck of being born in the swamp, doesnt mean they should be condemned to die there.
I agree with all you said, but be careful with the ‚Äúhuman nature‚Äù description. 

I think people often interpret that term to mean views or actions like that are normal and they are entitled to them.
Did anyone find him?
I would amend that to .. was it Brazil or Argentina the OG confederates and Nazi's ran off to? ..either way send them pamphlets from there.
Only law enforcement has access to any kind of personal information from license plate numbers- But im not sure if everyone knows that? Off topic, but i find it somewhat humorous when people blur their license plates in photos...
Complete incel through and through eh bud?
I coulda threatened to dust off my carbine, but I said words.

Y'all afraid of words now and that is telling. 

Words lead to thoughts, and thoughts lead to questions, and those things are terrifying to an autocratic regime. This country ain't been right for some time now, and not least of all because of this sick, deluded vision of the good old days.

There were no good old days. This day is better, and more fair and just than any that came before it, and that's a damn shame too cause we got a long way to go.

States rights maybe a little, though it is a pretty weak notion
That‚Äôs a rather big assumption. Why would you think people would find racism abhorrent and condone genocide of another race? That doesn‚Äôt make sense.
I'm ready for that conversation.
I am against the confederacy and colonialism. Is your point is to talk down to the people who want to make things better for all people, or do you want to be allies?
Many of us are aware of all of those issues and do have dialogue around it.  Would you suggest that we don‚Äôt take issue with or support racist ideology further?
I'm a queer immigrant of color originally from the south, and a fellow anarchist: this commentary ain't it. White people talking about home grown problems and how to deal with them is a GOOD thing. These bizarre, delusional, racist ass homegrown Vermonters should be discussed, and there absolutely should be brain storming on how to confront these douche bags because every single one y'all ignoring them comfortably in your privilege let's the people of color around you, the immigrants around you, the LGBTQ people around you know that they aren't safe and you don't care.

Is the US a neoliberal, imperialist sham? Absolutely. The US destroying my country is why I ended up here in the first place, but that doesn't mean you stop talking about racism inside the US because the government uses racism as a tool of colonialism and imperialism.
You're an anarchist, your opinion is irrelevant

Agree, in principal, but in practice there are some things you shouldn't say in polite company if you dont wanna get turned inside out like a dirty fucking sock.

One of those things you ought not to say is that you have the right to own other people, and that's what that stupid fucking flag says.
OP is exercising their right to free speech by saying f\*ck anyone flying the confederate flag, yet you seem to have an issue with it. The irony is strong with you.

Nah, ignoring this shit is what has allowed this country to be infested with Nazis voting for a fascist orange blob that tried to overthrow our democracy.

It's very cool! Where did you find it?
Technically we banned slavery before even becoming a US state. You are still right but I thought that it was a cool caveat.
If I remember right from the museum in Montpelier, part of the reason why Vermont joined the Union was that it disagreed with the federal law allowing owners to forcibly take back enslaved people if said people had made it to a free state. 

\*I know enslaved people is a better term but am unfamiliar with a better term for these bastards
Right. [This](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cDFIdtuiQ-E/TtDxM_xWzvI/AAAAAAAAAnU/f1U-e6Wo4m0/s320/white_flag_surrender.jpg) is the actual flag of the Confederacy.
Racism is still alive and well, unfortunately.
Yep - celebrating traitorous losers.

The problem is that racists still don't realize they lost. They thought 2016 was overtime.
Sociopaths love to do that shit. Get a charge out of causing people to react.
genuinely don't get the trend of making yourself look like an asshole as a weird political statement. Like, there's no commentary behind the provocativeness. There's no statement behind rolling coal other than "i like making everything around me look worse".
And it works!!!
The only thing it does for me is make me laugh at how stupid they look
It's cause "Ah'm a REBEL!! Don't step on mah snake!!" /s
Wasn‚Äôt Maine a big KKK state? Maybe it still is?
Vermont sent over 10% of its population to put down the traitorous rebellion and lost nearly 1.5% of its population to the war.  This was devastating to the demographics of the state.  Flying the flag of an enemy that bled the state of a brighter future in the name of chattel slavery is disgusting and disrespectful to the very real sacrifices of Vermonters to stand up for what is right and secure a brighter future for our country.
It's  clearly OK to have a confederate flag on your cherry 1970's charger if you plan to jump it off some stuff while on the run from a corrupt sheriff, after sleeping with your scantily clad first cousin. (Like a modern day Robin Hood) but that would be the only time it's acceptable.  And Waylon has to sign off on it.
I see what you did there
Why is this getting downvoted

![gif](giphy|qmbw7BPOcGLHZSB5Jn)
Lol, unbelievable downvotes for this..
There is no room for subtle references on Reddit! Downvote him!
Boss Hogg does not approve üëé
Not Georgia! That state is purple now and close to being blue. We don‚Äôt want to send reinforcements to the turds. 

Send him to Florida instead.
Thank you for not sending them here to NH. I‚Äôve got enough of a fight going on with all these fundies and I‚Äôm running out of the supply of ‚ÄúLive Free‚Äù.
Hilarious, and so true.
Please don‚Äôt, we already are above capacity for conservatives down here. We actually have a LOT of democratic voters in SC but we‚Äôre gerrymandered and legislated to maintain status quo.

Sorry. I don‚Äôt know why we‚Äôre leaking Confederates. 

Btw hookworm went away when everybody started wearing shoes, which is later than I‚Äôd care to admit.
We don't want em
You didn't expect them to be bright, did you?üòÇ
Fortunately he'll be pissing in the wind in this state.
I think the problem is multi-faceted. 

Primary and secondary education in the South have never been the highest quality, and schools still teach the political rationalization that the Civil War was about states' rights.

Also, Southerners are proud people. There's not a lot of money in most of the South. People are working class and they work hard. They want respect for that.

Unfortunately, even when it's true, a lot of the invective hurled against them is the opposite of the respect Southerners want. Like they say down there, you catch more flies with honey than vinegar. So that's another piece of the puzzle.

Even though flying the Confederate flag is misinformed and racism is indefensible, I just don't think we're gonna get 'em past it by yelling "fuck you" at pickup trucks. All that does is make the proud boys prouder.
Imagine refocusing your strident, angry energy from something you can't control to something you can.
Like a MAGA hat, it's an idiot identifier.
Nor ragrats!
I felt the same way at the time. The General Lee and Dixie playing when you honked the horn and all. But - I'm not talking anyone's experience but mine - all that was wrapped up in a huge tangle of implicit (and sometimes explicit) racism. It wasn't hate because we "weren't racist - I don't have a hateful bone in my body". We were just "aware of differences." You know, "different folks have different abilities" and such. Looking back on it, I think southern racists didn't feel the need to express hate overtly because the systems in place did such a thorough job in constraining black opportunity.

I think for me it feels like the past 15 years have just exposed more truthfully the hate that's always been behind these symbols in one form or another. And I completely agree with you - anyone who doesn't see it now is making a choice not to see it.

(Oh, and General Lee was a brave man who fought for people's rights to choose their own government, and he would've won if the Union hadn't had so many more bodies than the brave freedom-fighters in the south. Yeah - I was taught that.)
I was going to say the same thing. I remember when I was in college in the 90s there was an Asian kid from Richmond, Virginia, who had a stars and bars on the wall above his bed in his dorm room. When I asked him why he said he thought it looked cool. I don‚Äôt think it crossed his mind that it had anything to do with prejudice.
They do read it, they cherry pick verses that support their opinions. When you counter with a point from the bible they tell you, "you took that verse out of context" to try to cover their rear. It's pathetic.
I would settle for them having the same devotion to the rest of the library's contents beyond that one book.
Oh trust me. This guy was a POS who sexually harassed me and made me fear for my safety when I asked him to stop. He is absolutely a racist shit bag but didn‚Äôt want to actually speak it into existence outside of the klan meetings he probably attends.

Thanks yeah that was super cringe.
No? Cold War USSR is better or worse?
Hurr
It's a known fact that the monkeys with the smallest testicles make the most noise.

Life is changing faster than they can keep up, and now we're at this point where they feel backed into a corner and doomed (cause they are), so the howling gets louder and louder.

There is a certain inevitability on the side of progress, but also a very real danger that those loud ass, tiny testicle monkeys will do something crazy to keep themselves in power.
The problem is the ignorant ones are MUCH louder & literally in your face about it while all the progressive ones just sit back & watch you get called a faggot.  

Number of times some redneck hurled a slur for no reason in public in the last few years 7, number of times someone defended or said anything about it  ZERO
Nobody is saying they couldn‚Äôt emigrate. It would just leave the rest to wallow in their own misery without brining the rest of the country down.
Yeah this dude's weird.
America is the land of double standards.
Interesting. Your OP says otherwise.
lol when has america ever wanted to make things better for all people?
I appreciate the reply here and mostly agree. The core of my point is that this liberal handwringing of the confederacy more often than not is just a rhetorical exercise in purification. Confederacy bad, America good. When the confederacy is just mask off America. 

> White people talking about home grown problems and how to deal with them is a GOOD thing. 

Yes! And that includes analysis of the overlap between america and the confederacy (which is basically a circle imo) and that an important piece that‚Äôs usually missing.

> These bizarre, delusional, racist ass homegrown Vermonters should be discussed, and there absolutely should be brain storming on how to confront these douche bags because every single one y'all ignoring them comfortably in your privilege let's the people of color around you, the immigrants around you, the LGBTQ people around you know that they aren't safe and you don't care.

It‚Äôs easy to oppose obvious white supremacists waving confederate flags but it‚Äôs not so easy to unpack how these attitudes bleed into policy by well meaning liberals. An example would be how Bernie Sanders wants to use Bibi as a fall guy but will not challenge Zionism itself, which is the root cause. We will never get anywhere without soberly confronting root causes. Something I don‚Äôt think these liberals that handwring about visible confederate flags are capable of. 

> Is the US a neoliberal, imperialist sham? Absolutely. The US destroying my country is why I ended up here in the first place, but that doesn't mean you stop talking about racism inside the US because the government uses racism as a tool of colonialism and imperialism.

I feel you. I‚Äôm also from another country that has been by and large fucked over by the us. 

If you got ‚Äúwe should not talk about racism inside the US‚Äù from what I‚Äôve said then I‚Äôm not being clear because I think we need to talk about how the confederacy is just an old tumor inside of a larger creature that seems to have a knack for creating many similar tumors within itself and we should be examining the whole and the root causes rather than just isolating one symptom.
why?
But they all continue to benefit from their extermination and curiously don‚Äôt much to help and if god forbid some white person tries to even do a land acknowledgment 1/3 of the population would see them hanged in public for it.

edit: typo
which virtues am I signaling?
That isn‚Äôt free speech.  If any speech is oppressed by violence it should be dealt with by law enforcement protecting an individual from violence.
The actual confederate soldiers were of the mindset they were fighting the yanks because the yanks were murderous savages that were coming to kill them and take their land. You are aware how media works right?
Violence is not the answer.  Debate and understanding of each other creates real change.
Ding ding!  We spent a lot of the last 25 years ignoring it and believing it had disappeared.  Then the most self-involved president in history got elected and gave voice to these biases and it came back hard.  Ignorance doesn‚Äôt end an issue.
You seriously think America has nazis? Lol conversation over. I won't converse with delusions.
You can also find them easily online. Pretty sure i bought one from amazon for my dorm in college
At the Vermont Historical Society in Montpelier!
True. I remember loving the fact we outlawed slavery first, allowed civil unions first, and were the first state to allow gay marriage without it going to court. My hometown also ran out the KKK in the early 80s. It makes me laugh when people talk about how progressive Vermont has become. We have always been progressive.
Bring on the downvotes, but I don't think we should jump to pat ourselves on the back. Not only is there still tons of anti-black racism and disparity in VT, but we very much did have slavery in VT. Explicit laws outlawed the trade of slaves, but that's about all it was clear on, and that makes some mighty suspicious suggestions. Furthermore, it's not like it was strictly enforced. And because it was "illegal", records of slaves were not recorded, or may have been listed as "servants" etc. For instance, Ethan Allen owned slaves before he lived in VT, and when he was in Vermont, he had several black "servants". Yeah, sure. So it's likely there was quite a lot of slavery in Vermont, and though it may have been more along the lines of indentured servitude, it's still not something to be proud of. I agree that Vermont was still the best, but the bar was very low. And it still is low.
While "Slaver/Slavers" in International Law does carry a specific definition of those who force people into slavery and are engaged in human trafficking, the term which is used most commonly and applies more broadly is "Enslaver." 

The IRC has more on the topic, as does the NPS (though theirs is under revision, it is pretty good for discussing slavery in historical contexts).

A relative of mine just moved to a state that has several license plate styles to choose from. He said he wants to get the *In God We Trust* design because "that'll piss some people off." He's not religious. I can't imagine having such a mindset to go out of my way just to annoy people, but I guess it's pretty common.
Gotta ‚Äúown the libs‚Äù
like a rainbow flag
To be fair, I get it, I dont wanna get stepped on either.

But that's a far cry from what the other side is doin, which is ACTIVELY STEPPING ON SNAKES OF ANOTHER COLOR. Like..how they dont see this I dont know, it's such obvious hypocrisy and yet they are unaware. I legit think it might be a symptom of a malformed brain.
The irony of how don‚Äôt tread on me has been used as confederate/conservative narrative. When it‚Äôs original purpose is the opposite of that shit
The gasden flag is completely different. Yea it‚Äôs been co-oped by some racists, but it‚Äôs original meaning is bad ass.
"Pwease no steppy uwu" is still peak comedy to me.
Don‚Äôt tread was originally a libertarian flag. Altogether the right use it much more is see it as a fundamental American ideology
All of New England had pretty sizable kkk groups in the 1920s. The kkk was stronger in the northeast and Midwest than the south at the time. The big target of the klan back then were Catholics (along with Jewish and Black people, and ‚Äúpublic morality‚Äù), and Maine had a sizable French-Canadian catholic immigrant population that came to work in the mills. The KKK even helped elect the governor of Maine in 1924. But VT definitely had its own history with the klan, and I‚Äôm not trying to diminish that history in anyway through comparison with other states. 

There was a resurgence in the northeast in the 80s. There were attempts at rallies across the northeast that were mostly shut down.

Recently there was an armed white supremacist group buying land up in northern Maine for a training ground. The leader called it ‚ÄúBlut Stamm‚Äù, German for ‚ÄúBlood Tribe‚Äù. Seems like those plans have been abandoned. But according to the SPLC, there are 9 hate and anti-government groups in Maine, 15 in NH, 3 in Vermont, 11 each in MA and CT, 7 in RI.
Its a dukes of hazzard reference lmao
I don't think most people know about that show.
I guess people in Vermont don't have a sense of humor or are too high brow for the duke brothers.
Florida actually has more registered democratic voter, but sadly, it‚Äôs gerrymandered to hell.
NH state moto should be Live Free AND Die with the number of loud AF fart motorcycle riding people that don't wear a helmet. Just this morning into work not only did I see this, but this fool was also splitting lanes, it's like he was begging for death.
I am from the south and there are plenty of decent people to model your pride from: Dixie chicks, Willie Nelson, Dolly Parton, Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings,  Merle Haggard, Kris Kristofferson, Loretta Lynn, etc. There's more to the south than Toby Keith, Lee Greenwood, and Miller lite. Certainly not f*cking Trump from New York City. So anybody claiming racism and treason are how they express their pride, then they aren't proud of being Southern, they are proud of being racist.

Dudes that fly this flag are letting these uppity people of color who demand fair treatment know that they are the "silent majority" and they won't be silent anymore.
Yall have plenty to be proud of, that's what is so frustrating. Why TF do people wanna cling to the worst part of their history when they could champion current achievements instead?

Hell, if the flag was a pot of sweet tea beside a plate of scrapple with two (totally hetero) dudes high fiving, nobody would have a problem!
It is very multi-faceted - I‚Äôve resided here for 40 years (very unfortunately). 

The kinds of folks that we are talking about here do not deserve honey - they are twisted by their own simmering stew of ignorance, resentment, and alcohol. All of that, of course, makes them very easy to manipulate. 

I had a lot more to say, but I slept poorly and my lack of sleep is catching up with me - and I need to save my juice for the work day :)
That‚Äôs cute, thanks for the life advice ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
My husband and I live in Burlington and rode our bikes down to the waterfront a few hours before the eclipse started. A mother in a MAGA hat and her two teenage kids (I‚Äôm assuming) said something to us about being in their way so I told them to fuck off and go back to where they came from. She was clearly wearing that shit to get a rise out of Vermonters. I guess it worked on me üò¨
Or ashes on your forehead.

Yes, modern times have been slowly pulling back the veil of systemic racism, and opening the eyes of those willing to see the _implicit_ racism that underpins a lot of US culture.

We have several centuries of unfettered racism to unwind. It takes time and doesn't follow a linear course.

Currently, those who would like to put it all back in the bottle are feeling threatened and are fighting back ... largely due to one man who decided that their fear and outrage was politically expedient.
Ha! ‚ÄúVeterans for Trump‚Äù is a special kind of stupid
It is a symbol for worker solidarity. Various groups have co-opted it over the years but it does not strictly represent the USSR.

That is what I'd like to see change.


Just because we aren't assholes doesn't mean we can't be vocal.


Lord knows this country needs a militant left wing to balance out the crazy shit going on over there on the other side.
No it doesn‚Äôt
You're correct the United States of America's policies do very little for the good of people. I am not America, I am person who wants my country to be better to all people than it has ever been. So again, are we enemies or allies, or do you just want to come in here and troll?
You are stifling conversation, that's what I got. Your points are valid, but in a conversation on what to do with outspoken bigots, it dilutes the conversation. Suddenly people are having to discuss the laundry list of American ills instead of the concrete and material conversation of what do we do about this bigot in our community? Bigots who fly nazi flags, Confederate flags, etc are not harmless, and that's an ill that needs to be addressed in the immediate. Any conversation that deters that is not a useful one.
Someone who lacks enough common sense to support such a nonsensical ideology AND have hypocritical positions at the same time makes their opinions have no validity or credibility. In other other words, anarchist detected, opinion rejected
We all benefit, from Argentina to Alaska
Eh nah. I don‚Äôt mind treason being against the law. ¬†
You‚Äôre joking right?
Vermont has always been about individual liberty, which is a very different thing that having "always been progressive" in a political sense.
You can put asterisks on it all day but our point still stands.

Neither of us said things are perfect. Just a fact. 

Downvoted because you asked me to.
People are really unhappy and unwell. They have fully bought into the division rather than seeing through the divide and conquer tactics. We all need to unite against the very few who rule everything
The best thing to do is to do something that'll piss him off in return. Like wear a shirt that says, "Don't shit talk the troops, my girlfriend's husband fights for your freedom"
I know people who have  "choose life" plates in Fl. They could not understand why I would not ride in their car.
But in Vermont? I look to Vermont for good examples. They are easier to find there.
I have a co-worker that was a huge satanic atheist who now went Christian to trigger the libs. He is a sack of shit.
Yall remember back in the day when rednecks hated cops and the government? I member..

Now they all show polish connoisseur boot licking sobs. Life is too strange.
I'm from NH, every single Libertarian I know is a conservative going as far back as NH becoming known as the "Libertarian state." It's really mostly Reddit where you find the type of Libertarianism that borders on anarchy.
I agree.

I just think it would be more badass if it was 'don't tread on us' with a collection of newts, toads, frogs, snakes, and maybe an otter for good measure.

Now that's my kind of heresy!
I now refer to that as the 'manbaby flag'.
I agree. We have to stop letting the POS's take away everything.  Every rune that people aren't immediately familiar with is by default looked at as "is that nazi?" Hell, the regular American flag will trigger some folks because they think you are a "patriot" and a MAGA tool.  It's all just getting out of hand.
Love seeing cops fly that.
Their babysitters didn't tune into TNN in the 80s.
Minus the flag that was a bad ass car.
Without Gerrymandering, the GOP would have far less power.
Gerrymandering doesn't really impact statewide elections, and they have a Republican governor, two Republican senators, and have voted for the Republican candidate in the past two presidential elections. If there really are more Democrats there, they need to get off their asses and vote.
Sadly not anymore, as of a couple of years ago. There are anywhere from 100-200k more Republicans than Democrats now. 

Florida is solid red.
NC too
Your response was perfect.
> a few hours before the eclipse started. A mother in a MAGA hat and her two teenage kids (I‚Äôm assuming) said something to us about being in their way 

you were in their way ... of viewing the sun during an eclipse? How?  The sun isn't big enough in the sky? Geez these people are insufferable.
And the swastika existed long before it became a Nazi hate symbol.  Before WWII, the swastika was generally regarded as a positive symbol representing auspiciousness and good fortune.
oh ok
Based on what you‚Äôve said we‚Äôre allies. And if we are going to address the issues of America from within we need to be realistic about what we‚Äôre dealing with and all this handwringing about the confederacy shows an extreme lack of self awareness.
fair enough but I personally don‚Äôt see how me expressing that handwringing about confederate flag stickers being displayed is the lowest hanging fruit is stifling conversation when I‚Äôm actually urging for a much deeper one and why it‚Äôs needed. most people cheering on this thread will conveniently reject ‚Äúconfederate‚Äù ideals and just stop there and never care to see how current American policy doesn‚Äôt differ much.  Or to put it in other terms, MLKs stern warnings about the white moderate. 

Do we need to be concerned with the extremely obvious neo nazis? Of course. But I am equally if not more concerned about the liberals that uphold the same systems of harm under the American flag. That‚Äôs all. Plus I just personally just enjoy making liberals squirm on the internet so there‚Äôs that.
I could say the exact same thing about wannabe capitalist liberals. 

Anarchists believe in self-organization and voluntary association. That power corrupts people and most politicians are selfish and useless. 

Anarchism is just following common sense and democracy to their logical ends.

I see you‚Äôre not ready for that conversation since you just go around defending capitalism with all your energy.
It‚Äôs also always been about responsibility to community.
Well, Vermont's state motto is Freedom and Unity, which is pretty progressive, especially when compared to the motto of some neighboring states I won't mention.  The motto was adopted in 1788, so, yeah, I think we've always been progressive.
What I commented was also just facts. Also, I agreed with your point. Just added on to it. I think that's valid.

Apologies if I sounded accusatory--I didn't mean to, because it is a cool caveat. I left the comment for the folks who would invariably read the original comment and stick it in their back pocket along with their "I got a black friend".

Sure but if you just wait a few years they‚Äôll all die.
Oh, I‚Äôm sorry to hear that but not surprised. When we bailed on our Florida ‚Äòretirement‚Äô and came home (2017) there were more democrats. I guess we aren‚Äôt the only ones that fled when trump was elected.

True and I fully anticipated someone would say this. The difference is that many socialist groups today still use the symbol and are absolutely not hate groups. You may dislike or disagree with socialist ideology but ultimately they believe in and advocate for equality. Modern groups who display the Confederate or Nazi flags or symbols are predicated on hate and discrimination. No one is displaying the swastika to advocate for peace and good fortune any more. Big difference in my opinion.
Vermont's dislike of slavery closely aligned them with Abe Lincoln's Republican party, so if you consider Abe Lincoln to be progressive (he was), then in that sense you're correct.  But Vermont continued as an extremely Red state for very long period of time.  In the 1930s, very few states were voting *against* FDR.  But Vermont was.  I wouldn't say that a state voting against FDR has "always been progressive".

You don't look like a newt
That is 100% true, but I and the the person I replied to were talking about Florida?
You‚Äôd be surprised by how many not so old rich people who don‚Äôt want to pay income taxes have moved to Florida. And they vote Republican.
They actually have a pretty solid red voting block with Hispanic immigrants. Hispanic vote has swung pretty hard from blue for Obama to red for Trump. Mainly because of "communism/socialist rhetoric and fox news."
Yeah‚Ä¶perfect timing on that exit, by the way. 

I wanted to leave then but it took longer for my husband to give up. He was born and raised here and can‚Äôt believe how bad it‚Äôs gotten.

Yes, the Soviets didn't _fully_ destroy the symbolism of the hammer and sickle, but they definitely tarnished it a bit, and you're right ... it never really became a symbol of hate either.

That said, the Soviets were never _really_ Socialists or Communists either ... they were just dictators with furry hats.  They just used the banner of Communism/Socialism to control all means of production, and enrich themselves while sucking the people dry.
I got better.
I‚Äôm not surprised.  I keep getting /r/Florida suggestions on my feed and everyone there is like ‚Äúhey does anyone know anyone who is actually from Florida?‚Äù

Eagerly awaiting Florida deciding to build a wall against retirees.
Correct - it‚Äôs not really Hispanic/Latin voters either. It‚Äôs primarily Cuban voters with historical trauma.

The moment they hear the word ‚Äúsocialism‚Äù they become absurdly irrational and combative.

Like, you could give them every great social benefit but the moment it‚Äôs ‚Äúsocialism‚Äù they will reject it violently to the detriment of their own well-being.

Or, in other words, exactly like your typical Republican cheering on the death of Medicare or being fully against universal healthcare while relying on insulin or other key prescription drugs just to literally survive.

You‚Äôll never believe this
These pictures were taken today 2/10/24 over Lake Willoughby during the thunderstorm that rolled right towards us. TWICE in about a 10 minute span, I took a picture of the lake, perfectly timed with the lightning bolt. These pictures are unedited. If you zoom in on the second picture, the bolt of lighting looks like it‚Äôs striking the ice fisherman‚Äôs head. I am still in shock this happened. Going to buy a lottery ticket.
You should enter that in the National Geographic photo contest.
Awesome awesome shots!
Awesome! You should submit that to some photo contest or something
That fisherman is probably scraping his drawers after that experience.
Incredible!!  

(sidebar: it has been waaaaaaay too warm this winter to be ice fishing IMO‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm a total weenie that way)
Thanks everyone! So happy to share this with you! I love Vermont so much. Definitely going to submit this to NatGeo in the morning.
That is a once in a lifetime shot!
this photo is completely insane
I was there as well! We had just gotten in the car after skiing at Willoughby State Park when it really started happening. As we drove up 5A we said ‚Äúget off the ice, my dudes, there‚Äôs lightning going off...‚Äù
Yeah February thunderstorms surprised everyone! Awesome, awesome shot! I second the nat geo suggestion.
Would you look at that
If I were that fisherman I would want that picture displayed on my wall. What a conversation piece when you have guests.
I‚Äôm more shocked people are ice fishing Willo
Really amazing shots! Get that framed. Did you check on that fisherman just in case?!? Lol
Wow! Thought this was black and white. Lol.
That's so cool! Thanks for sharing them.
You are right I dont believe there was a thunderstorm today in Vermont.
I've seen thundersnow once in my life and it was incredible and lightning in general in the winter twice.

Amazing job with the pictures.
Yowza!
We felt both of those cracks over the house. I thought a transformer blew. Awesome shots!
That second photograph is spectacular! The first is very good too.
Awesome.  Award-winning quality!
actually insane dude, this is a world class shot
These are amazing!!! Let us know how it goes with NatGeo!
All luck used up for a lifetime :(
One of my .ost favorite places in the world with the coolest photos ever....nice
Incredible photographs.
Great images !
What a shot! amazing.
Woah
Amazing
Nice!
Wow!!!
WOW
Amazing!
This looks like frozen Kattegut from Vikings
The second one almost looks more like it's shooting skyward out of the fisherman's head. Pretty cool.
Wow! Nice photos, right time, right place
Is that the God damn rain in the second picture as well? How much did it pour for this February thunderstorm?
That‚Äôs wild
I can hear Zeppelins Immigrant Song cueing just looking at these pics.
Amazing timing, what a cool photo!
Wow!!!
The question is did you catch any fish and if so what?
Cannot upvote this enough!!!
photog here.

Holy shit! üëèüëèüëèüëèüëè
I feel like that second picture is perfect for r/fuckyouinparticular
These are UNREAL shots!!!!
Incredible
Stunning photos. I knew where this was taken as soon as I saw it.
Wow incredible shot! Happy for you!
They‚Äôre incredible.
Bravo, good cath, quite the storm
Hubbity hoobity this got me jazzed
My mother and I love lighting in thunderstorms, this is so cool, ill have to show her.
What awesome pictures! I have been trying so hard to get a picture of lightning lol these turned out so good i am so impressed
That's metal af
Great photo ! Timing was perfect.
Very cool.
Full on thunderstorms and a tornado in Wisconsin this past week.
Amazing
"Fuck that spot in particular"
Amazing shot! This is awesome!
Fabulous.
‚ö°Ô∏è!
Great shots wow!!
I looked but it doesn‚Äôt seem like they are accepting photos :( the best info I could find is tagging them on instagram, which I did. I did submit these to a few local photo contests so we‚Äôll see!
Honestly they should.
Thank you! I still can‚Äôt believe it happened‚Ä¶twice!
Funny thing is he probably had no idea. He was looking away and the bolt was soooo far away from him on the other side of the Lake.
Ice was solid in northern VT in most places (not Champlain proper though some bays) but this warm spell made it more sketchy. I bet the ice there on Willoughby was over 8 inches thick. It you would be surprised how long it takes ice to melt even in the 40s though. 

Regardless, drill test holes and don‚Äôt go on a body of water you are not familiar with!
Was out on Eligo today.  Ice was about 10‚Äù thick.
And they got it twice
You totally passed us! We dashed back to the car just as the wind starting getting crazy. Felt like the Caddy Shack thunderstorm on a golf course scene  haha
I was thinking while posting this ‚ÄúI hope that man is on this Reddit thread‚Äù haha
I'm not. Every year you hear about people falling through ice somewhere. People just don't think or don't care.
I didn‚Äôt but I also would have definitely noticed if he got struck lol
Thank you! I was absolutely shocked to see a thunderstorm in Vermont in February. The thunder was echoing off the mountains and I‚Äôve never heard anything like it.
Just an update. It doesn‚Äôt look like NatGeo accepts any photos but I did make an instagram post and tag them in it like it tells me to do on their website so we‚Äôll see if they even see it. However, I did submit it to a few Vermont Photo contests, fingers crossed!
Thank you! Will do!
Hope that‚Äôs not the case! Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised though
I wasn‚Äôt ice fishing unfortunately. Haven‚Äôt seen the lake before and have always wanted to visit. I didn‚Äôt notice if anyone else was catching fish. I think we were all preoccupied by the storm coming right as us haha
Thank you! My first thought after taking them was this Reddit thread!
I will have to post it there!
Thank you! Got a big goose egg on the lottery so it looks like this is what a lifetime of luck amounts to haha
Good luck! These are sick photos!
Thanks for posting.  These shot are surreal. At first I thought it was some Simon Stalenhag images, especially the first one with the two people and that red circle. Like other posters have suggested, these would be unbeatable in any photo contest.  Right place, Right time.
Lightning never strikes twi‚Ä¶ eh nevermind.
Username checks out üòú
Last year was bad. Usually old timers who don‚Äôt realize the ice is not always solid at the times it used to be. It was 55 when I was fishing yesterday.
That's awesome! You should maybe try submitting to Seven Days as well! Or tag them if they have an Instagram.
I don't blame you for watching that storm! Hey, at least you were out on the lake as it looked beautiful.
Take my upvote haha
Yeah it was so warm. I definitely would not feel safe ice fishing in that weather. Some spots it seemed like there wasn‚Äôt even ice. Could have been water pooled on the ice though
Just found their website, I‚Äôll look into it. Thanks!
It was breathtaking! I wish I could have captured the thunder rumbling and echoing around the lake. It was the most wild thunder I have ever heard.
Vermont ü§òüèº
Recently went to vermont and I just wanna take a moment to appreciate this sign, 10/10 was the best part of my Vermont experience. 


Vermont needs more of this.

Additionally, I'd like to see "Leave No Trace, Motherfuckers!" posted at every trailhead.
This is awesome, thanks for sharing. ü§òü§òü§ò
I'm a lurker from the Adirondacks and we have similar problems here. I'm curious tho, do you guys have the same problem with tourists interfering with wildlife that we do here? The locals generally know to leave the deer and bear alone but the tourists will try to feed them and pet them and sh*t and usually ends badly for the animal. Is it the same there?
Someone who often drives my road enjoys twisted teas, bud light platinum, and a particularly cheap brand of cigarettes
Well put
Thank you Im tired of picking trash up on my fucking road.
Oh, it aint just the crack heads, either. I see plenty of "honest, good, church goin' folks" chucking shit at a trash can, missing and walking away. Or leaving an empty water bottle crushed on a trail. Or leaving bottles and cans on disc golf courses. Lots of assholes here lol
It would be awesome if the state started making this an official slogan.
I live close to a Creek and every spring a snapping turtle would go through my garden, planted or not, and leave her eggs. She was out by the road one day and a New Yorker stopped and was going to pet the thing. It was fairly large. Unfortunately, my husband was outside and suggested she might want to leave it alone
Yeah, we've got a good collection of crackheads up that way. (I recognize the sign, don't know the road name, but I know the corner you turn up onto when you see it)
That should be our new state flag
The number of commenters on this post who've seemingly never heard of a ladder is astonishing.
Beautiful
I love the sign but the cynical side of me can't help but notice something. Everyone seems tosupport this kind of sign for the litter bugs, even the crackhead ones. Put that sign up in Burlington tho, because you're fed up with needles, and you'd likely get a much different response. People would be telling you to just dispose of them and would shame you for calling them crackhead motherfuckers. 

Just funny the different views at times, that change based on situation and subjectivity. Humans are strange in that way. There's a part in "The Courage to be Disliked" where the philosopher uses an analogy of well water. Well water largely stays the same temperature year round but if it's summer time you think it's colder and if it's winter you think it's warmer. 

I apologize for my overly active brain activity üôÉ
That's just fabulous.
Do crackhead motherfuckers read or heed signs?
This makes me happy
üòÜ best
I think I might make one of these too
We have shit heads here in Maine too. There‚Äôs not a lot you can do to get me furious at you, but littering will
Well, it‚Äôs not lying. Give a hoot, don‚Äôt pollute.

Pack in / pack out,  and leave no trace .
If trees could speak
Too many crackhead motherfuckers in this state, sadly.
‚úåÔ∏è
Hell yeah
It‚Äôs usually locals who dump garbage on the side of the road.
I feel so shitty and sad when I see 987 upvotes for this post.  Really?!? This is one of the best things about Vermont?!?   F\*ck that!!!!!  This may be the first time I'm ashamed of my state.  Hey- if you've got time and energy to comment and complain and upvote this POS sign I'm asking you to consider expending that time and energy on more helpful endeavors.  You might start by educating yourselves about the generational trauma and socio-economic conditions that keep people trapped in addiction and perpetuate narcissistic and sociopathic tendencies.  Maybe instead of targeting your "crackhead" neighbors you could stand up to the real villains in our society who are getting away with waaaaaaaay worse harms on a deadly scale.  Just sayin'
You know, there are parts of Vermont we New Hampshirites would welcome with open arms, but then you all needed to fuck it up with Burlington.
How did they get up there
‚ÄúYes it includes fruit peels and nut shells you ingrates‚Äù
I've seen out-of-staters exit their cars when seeing a moose, and try to walk nearer to get pics or just delighted to see them; locals would yell at them to knock it off and get back in their vehicles. Though they seem to have a healthy respect for bears, that ive seen.
Happens all over. National parks have all sorts of problems with  these sorts of things. Occasionally you'll see someone get trashed by a bison in Yellowstone. The ultimate FAFO.
This is everywhere, man.
I think many of us were pissed at the bear fiasco. All caused by out of towners and not people from Old Forge. All they know how to do at least the younger crowd is to cause issues.
It's always twisted tea and bud light. They seem to land the cardboard box in the same spot every few days. It'd be way more convenient for both of us if they'd just think to put the damn cans in the box before they chuck it.
Mmmm do they have a lifted truck üõª ü§î
Oh, we must live on the same road...?
If there was a higher redemption price, and on more containers, this might curb the littering.
Thank you for making this sign, I hope the crackhead mother fuckers stop littering 

nobody likes a crackhead motherfucker nevermind a littering crackhead motherfucker
How did you get that plywood up there and attached? ¬†
Or picking up after their dog while hiking, then leaving the shit-filled bag at the trailhead.
I read ‚Äúcracker head‚Äù lol
Lol I wish!
I saw your use of the word "unfortunately" in that story and I'd like to express my appreciation for it. Some people just have to learn the hard way and we should let them.
How high up is that sign?
Actually they are probably junkie motherfuckers.
Crackhead motherfuckers are capable of doing many things
I see a business opportunity...
Found the Burlington resident
I want to know what part of the country/world tourists are coming from that so many of them think going near any big wild animals is a good idea, because I‚Äôm originally from an upper great plains state and the amount of people who think it‚Äôs a good idea to go anywhere near bison is astounding and you know those are the exact same people going up to moose
We call moose unicorns here because they're always talked about, but never seen so, I can understand taking a picture of a moose from your car. Getting out and approaching one seems like suicide by stupidity.
I laugh every time I see one of the idiots get thrown 30 feet by a living bus. I just don't understand how it's not common sense not to fuck with animals.
I didn't realize the news about that had spread so far. I'd like to think it would make a difference in how people act but I don't have that much faith in humanity.
I don‚Äôt even get the box just the cans
Haven‚Äôt seen who it is but there is a red pickup with a rusted out exhaust that rips up my road about 20 over. Might be related
it wouldn't... in fact it might make them do it more (for spite)
I counted 17 poop bags at Sucker Brook yesterday. 6 of them were in a little pile at the trailhead!
Even better lol
Not higher than the crackhead mother fuckers
10-15 ft, it's on a bank, clearly visible just driving normal. Any bit of awareness at all and you can't miss it. It's up in the Kingdom, Orleans/Brownington area
Urban environments where every animal encounter they've had has been with a tame animal so they just assume that all animals exist to amuse us. I was at Yellowstone once and this kid comes running up to his dad shouting "DAD, DAD, I TOUCHED A BISON,"
to which his father replied, "Well it don't count if I don't got a picture of it! Go on back!"

Meanwhile a park ranger is running down the boardwalk from hundreds of yards away full sprint screaming "GET AWAY FROM THE BISON, NOWWWW!"

Dudes got a stressful job dealing with literal throngs of ppl like you described.
Fr! I‚Äôve lived in Vermont for 10 years and not ONCE have I seen a moose in state I left the state to go out west on a vacation and I saw 2 damn moose‚Äôs
Yeah, they are so kewl to spot but they are *huge* ! And so many have that brain parasite that makes the poor things even more unpredictable.
Just the other day another person was handing feeding a deer looked like by the Old Forge Fire Department where they like to hang out. No. People definitely don't learn and I don't have faith that they will
I was just wondering if the determined sign-poster shimmied up there!
This is it. Used to live right by Yellowstone and I'd put it around 25% of the adult human population has no idea what a wild animal in the wild actually }is. These people can spend their entire lives in a city and spend 2 weeks every decade in a position where they might encounter nature. And strictly being observational here, most of the Chinese tourists (and there were tons of them, apparently the park is a huge thing for them to go visit) would function about one half-step above completely brain dead. Countless times they were trying to touch elk or bison, walking out on the thermal features where people fall through and die every year, etc etc and when they're faced with a group of people screaming at them and waving them off or waving at them to come back and everyone's clearly agitated about it the standard response was to vigorously wave back with the biggest smile a person can have plastered on their face like they're having the time of their life and are just completely ignorant.
@touronsofyellowstone on insta for a great follow... @bozemanairportcowboys is good time too
Just sharing this photo I took yesterday 
Not sure if it looks good or way too edited but either way I love visiting your state. It‚Äôs therapeutic. ü´∂üèª 

Holy saturation.

Ah the K1
Sold photo, where you riding

Perfect word for it.¬†
Niiiice. Really not looking forward to the winter when it's too cold for me to just wander around outside and take pictures like i can the rest of the year.
OP Would you recommend this one over the Stowe gondola for the upcoming weekend? Also, how's the parking situation? Do i need to buy tickets online beforehand or just show up and wait in a queue?
Stowe?
Hahah I thought so too :( but I only really reduced highlights and added a vsco filter (FF 5)
Please be careful, Milton is currently the stuff of nightmares. It is a very powerful storm.
:(
Stay safe, friend.
Yesss
Yes I was, it was so hard to take the picture with the little bit of space the windows allow
You need to purchase them online as opposed to Stowe where you can just show up and do it in person (especially if it‚Äôs for same day). One big advantage of Killington is the fact that‚Äôs closer to CT than Stowe (an additional 75 miles) and the views are just as great. Also check the weather because when I went, it was sunny in Killington and cloudy in Stowe.
Nope, Killington!
lol it literally says Killington on the gondola üòÇ
What did you take the picture on? My iPhone refuses to pick up leaf peepage. It turns all that red and orange to a shadowy dark green. It‚Äôs baffling.
Sick, ment to say solid btw üíÄ
Beautiful
Mine does this too, and it‚Äôs infuriating! I‚Äôve had to resort to using live mode, and scrubbing through the clips for the most accurate one of the set.
iPhone 15 Pro Max. It‚Äôs definitely frustrating, what helped me capture this one was the sun. The sun did everything. I only used the filter because everything was way too yellow and bright, so I darkened it a little with the filter.
Lol I know
I feel like iPhones try to detect what our pictures *should* look like, and then they try to enhance accordingly. What‚Äôs crazy is my sunset pictures are always superior to everyone else‚Äôs pictures of the same exact sunset. The camera can pick up reds and oranges just fine then! But in that case it recognizes that it‚Äôs a sunset and sprinkles on some magic. When it sees a forest, it wants it to be green I think.
A very Vermont political sign. 
Seen in Craftsbury
I saw this as a bumper sticker in Essex a few weeks ago and I chuckled for days

That is one of the many burns about him not being a real Appalachian
This is my cue here to rant about how much I hate cast iron. No putting it in the dishwasher‚Ä¶you have to do some esoteric rite to ‚Äúseason‚Äù the thing‚Ä¶ oh, and it weighs as much as a Buick. For sure there‚Äôs other cookware that gets similar results that does not require allll the special TLC.
Politically, howevs..I‚Äôm 100% on board for mocking Vance.

wow showed him!
I dare say not a real person... How long have you worked here? OK, good. What do people order for doughnuts? OK, good. You don't want your face shown? OK, good.

Dude is some kinda weird robot.
It seems daunting, but it's not that tricky to work with. Seasoning isn't some weekly ritual, you do it once when you get the pan, and then again each time your in-laws put it in the dishwasher. Like three times a year max.
But you get a unique flavor with cast iron, AND some iron leeches into your food!¬†
I‚Äôm a big cast iron girlie myself. But every time I go to use it and it‚Äôs not in its proper form of seasoning I go to my all clad stainless steel instead. üòÇ
Bacon will season it.¬†


Grilled cheese.¬†


¬†Repeat.¬† ¬† Repeat again.¬†


¬†Cook an omlette on it.¬†¬†


Abuse¬† from time to time.¬†


It will take care of itself.
It‚Äôs super easy to clean and keep nice. When I‚Äôm done cooking, if there‚Äôs anything stuck on I pour in a couple cups of water and let it boil, then give it a quick scrape off with the spatula while boiling. Then it goes in the sink, sprinkle on some kosher salt and give it a quick scrub with a chain mail scrubber to get off anything really stuck on and then rinse it off. At that point it‚Äôs clean, and if it‚Äôs looking a little dull I‚Äôll just wipe the inside with vegetable oil and leave it on a low burner for an hour or so. This pretty much keeps it in perfect condition to cook. It‚Äôs no harder than cleaning any other pan really, just scrub it with coarse salt instead of soap. On the plus side you aren‚Äôt dealing with a nonstick coating that will eventually break down.
You just clean it as normal with soap tbh. No seasoning necessary.
And now he‚Äôs the vp goddammit
I‚Äôm Infamous for making something cheesy in it then throwing it in the oven to forget it exists. üòÖ
Wait‚Ä¶ you think that adding layers of cooking stuff without washing the pan is the ‚Äúseasoning‚Äù? Oh no lolllllllll
Yep.. It's an embarrassing day for America. And MMW trump won't live through the next 4 years, and I am in no way implying or encouraging an assignation. The dude looks like hell and is the oldest president ever and is super unhealthy. And we all know the toll a 4 year term takes on each and every president.

The scary part right now for me personally, well just one of the many, is that Vance will become president by default during trumps term. And that is something to be afraid of. I think he would push the project 25 narrative much further than the orange idiot would. But I could be wrong.

Either way I'm pretty disappointed in 51% of American's right now. But the difference is I'm not going to throw a tantrum, riot in the street, or storm the godamn capital. I'm going to be pissed, annoyed, let down and dumbfounded over the next few days, but I will move on and just keep working and living. That's the difference between a normal American and maga.

Edit for clarity - trump would be the oldest president ever should he make it thru the next 4 years
I believe he does that AND reuses his condoms
Just put the oven on 500, turn on the fan, open the door and - voila - reseasoned!
Keep having this discussion with my boyfriend‚Ä¶ he insists they don‚Äôt need to be washed (I wash them when he‚Äôs not home) and that the crust on the walls is ‚Äúsupposed to be there‚Äù ü§¢
Iron skillets are not that precious. They get seasoned, like it or not.
I bet their food tastes better than yours
Removing all coatings  via a wood fire allows a fresh start on seasoning.
Seasoning is a process where you spread a thin layer of oil onto a clean cast iron pan and then bake it at a high temperature. Seasoning is not a buildup of oils that you just leave on the pan without washing it hahaha
I honestly thought they meant that they let everything build up and don‚Äôt wash it ever. I season my cast iron every few months, but I wash it with Dawn after I use it.
Yes, and ordinary use seasons a pan
Natural beauty 
Just drove up and looking for a place to stay tonight. Would prefer to only see locals who look like Rockwell paintings. Currently parked in the middle of Rt. 7 and need your suggestions ASAP.
Breathtaking. Everything is just simpler up here in Vermont. Slower. More saturated.
Would also love directions to your favorite secret swimming hole for my trip up next summer.¬†
I don't think it's saturated enough. Slide that saturation slider up.
Hey, OP, can you give me the exact coordinates of this picture? I want to drive slow as fuck getting there and block traffic so I can post a picture on my IG. Also if you have any suggestions of what to do in and around Stowe, I would love it!!! Coming next week and I haven‚Äôt planned a fucking thing! Is there a train from Burlington airport to Stowe? Or should I rent a car?

Amazing post! Natural beauty! Gorgeous! Can you tell me how far from Stowe this is I‚Äôm coming up from NJ soon and want to make sure I hit all the hidden gems on my way to our favorite little (air)B&B.
I love this place! Everyone I follow on tiktok says it is THE place to be during peak foliage. I was trying to get there last week, but the tour bus I was on got stuck in some place called the Notch, so I wasn't able to make it.
Now back up and have your boyfriend take a picture of you with this as a background. Make sure you're wearing an oversized roll-neck sweater and high boots, and toss your hair. You *do* have long auburn hair, right?
It's too bad the red leaves aren't popping.  But I do love how the grass is so...so.... neon. Must be the warm dry summer we had. Chefs kiss to the editor

Sunday Drive made the best edit
Shame they had to knock down the house and now the property is a Superfund site. That's what happens when millions of people take too many HRD photos of a location. Tourists, do better.
If you stay put there on Rt7 you can slowly watch them all turn green again.

My fianc√© and I are planning to move here never having visited before. We both have high paying jobs and work remotely so real estate prices shouldn‚Äôt be a problem. So long as we aren‚Äôt near any stinky farms. We would love a lot of land that we can post no trespassing signs all over to keep out the gross locals. But will need some locals to travel great distances to provide essential services at poverty level wages. We love the idea of Vermont, but are expecting it to be exactly like the urban area that we are coming from at the same time! Does anyone know any good nail salons, spin classes and spas for my fianc√©? Also looking for recommendations for grooming and doggy day care for our French Bulldogs.
Actually you can‚Äôt drive there right now.  The road is closed for the exact reason you stated.
You and your group of 7 should all rent e-bikes and ride them in the road like a motorcycle gang going half the speed limit and refusing to let cars pass. And don‚Äôt forget to stop often to take selfies.
Sorry, this one location was officially shut down by the town. Road only open to folks who live on it.  Thank the Insta mob for that one.

It‚Äôs the Aerosmith home on Cloudland Rd near Woodstock. You can get a great picture from the rd easily since it‚Äôs a back road with little traffic. Can‚Äôt go down the driveway though as there‚Äôs a gate. As for Stowe, ride the Gondola and hike the mountain there. Also nearby is the Ben and Jerry‚Äôs factory.

At least people moving here bring tax revenue versus people buying investment properties and vacation homes where the state never sees a dime of income tax from them.

I'll admit though (as one of those transplants everyone here hates) the idea that random people can just come wander onto my property with rifles is, frankly, bizarre. The principle of "right to roam" as it applies to hiking and foraging is something I can definitely get behind. But it's dumb as fuck that I have to make sure my dogs wear blaze orange vests if I want to take them for a walk on *my own property* so they don't get shot by a hunter.
Just stay in NYC or Boston!!! LOL

It‚Äôs their way of showing their family tree is a circle.
Ny plate?
A Confederate flag? In this climate?!
I have at least two neighbors in the Islands who fly theirs proudly, along with a Marine flag, if you can believe that. As an actual Southerner transplant up here, it‚Äôs disgusting for me too. Who in their right mind is proud of a war they lost? It will never make sense to me.
Ain‚Äôt no confederate heritage in VT. Then again it was never about heritage‚Ä¶..
Me: man, living in the US kinda sucks sometimes...üòîüòëüòì

Also me when seeing a CSA flag: UP WITH THE STARS DOWN WITH TRAITORS! EACH DIXIE BOY MUST UNDERSTAND THAT HE MUST MIND HIS UNCLE SAM!!!üá∫üá∏üóΩüéáüá∫üá≤üá∫üá≤üá∫üá≤

White supremacy attitude on bold display is very sad, and ugly.¬†
Its embarassing for all of us because we allow it. Yall should look into the Paradox of Tolerance for regerence, popularized by Karl Popper during WWII. The only thing that *actually* stops hate is an absolute intolerance of its intolerance. Love only enables, and does jack shit to stop any sort of hate.
I‚Äôve never understood why anyone would want to fly those flags. Announce to the world that you‚Äôre a pos?
Oh I saw that exact truck on my way to the grocery store. I yelled at them to take their loser flag down and they definitely didn‚Äôt hear me but it made me feel a little better.
They drive past cemeteries full of dead union soldiers, too. How disgraceful.
Unfortunately, these people are going to feel even more empowered now.
Better get used to it. Only going to get worse from here.
1865 season runner-ups
Of course he‚Äôs flying a Trump flag
Aww their participation ribbon. Such sad little snowflakes.
We are plagued with a large population of people who never fully matured and are acting out. The least common denominator is reactionary behavior and beliefs driven by the sense they are routinely reminded of being on the wrong side when it comes to values like decency and respect for all people. The pattern is clear, from obnoxious tailgating to sociopathic statements and tendencies. The need for attention is pretty pathetic.

![gif](giphy|3otPoEiEGXh41xKGdO)
Again, no matter how people want to spin the shit, the people who still wave that flag today don‚Äôt give a damn about ‚ÄúSouthern Pride‚Äù.
Have you been to the NEK?
I remember driving through Bennington in 2016 and being shocked to see a confederate flag. Being originally from a confederate state, I'd hoped to have left that behind.
They're emboldened by the election. They've been loud, incredibly rude, and honestly even angrier than before the election. I think a lot of them are disappointed they didn't get their chance to hunt liberals, totally normal healthy people.
Well because the Civil War did not end in an official peace treaty, it's still going on, and therefore it might be arguably legal to kill Confederates as enemy combatants. (This is flippant bad advice no one should actually take but it's funny to this embittered old Unionist currently living in the Deep South.)
They get embarrassed that easily ü§™
NY license plate?
You think embarrassment is something they can still feel?
Nice photo.  Like a Norman Rockwell, Collins.   Makes me think of Levon Helm singing with The Band in centeal Mass, 1976.

I was just 12. 

"The Night they Drove Old Dixie Down," ELECTRIC reeking of Vermont grown, and at the same time, so sad and melancholy yet necessary, the slaughter required to kil America's and capitalism's unteathered Frankenstein monster: slavery, starting with John Brown, a misguided zealot is how Abe called him, a NY boy from the Finger Lakes as I recall. 

That flag means a lot of things to just a few people.  To most people it's just idiocracy, and Nixon's southern strategy. Gen Lee buried it for good but the Free speech means the canary still sings lies.
What does it mean to them?
I am seeing too much of this crap around. Hate it.
It's nice that they let us know who they are right up front.
Just tell folks with Confederate Flags to,  ‚ÄúGo back to their own country.‚Äù They don‚Äôt seem to like it for some reason though. I just don‚Äôt know why. Go figure.
I just tell them that flag was in one war and lost it lol
I think it‚Äôs trashy too, but like really, are you suggesting they stop? People like you and I may think it‚Äôs vile, but it‚Äôs freedom of speech and expression, and you can‚Äôt suggest taking that from people. It‚Äôs all about understanding that everyone has their own perspective, no matter how terrible or stupid it may seem to us.
I never understand living in a northern state flying a confederate flag. If it‚Äôs about history, you live in a state that fought the confederates?
Lack of geographical awareness lol
Some of my ancestors from VT died during the civil war.  Killed by Confederates.  Any Vermonter who flies the Confederate flag can fuck right off..
Ew
Show them the way south
Traitor
Am I the only one seeing the NY plate? So a guy (presumably) with Confederate flags on his truck drove through North Bennington. Things like this happen in the world.
Give them a break. Their swastika flag is in the wash.
It's Bennington...
I don‚Äôt get the idea of ‚Äúconfederacy‚Äù, these are the same people that lost the war and continues to fly their flags. Can you imagine the Nazi‚Äôs doing this in America. Those people that fought for freedom would turn over their graves.. oh, wait.
https://benningtonmuseum.org/library/walloomsack/volume-11/bennington-in-the-civil-war.pdf
I can‚Äôt make out the plate.   Isn‚Äôt vt green plates?
NY Lic Plates‚Ä¶ not that we don‚Äôt have our fair share of this type. This one just isn‚Äôt ours‚Ä¶
I‚Äôm in Keene but get the sub recommended to me. A man was walking around downtown with a confederate civil war era hat on today.
I thought they kept this kinda stuff on the other side of the river
In our states defense even if not entirely warranted that truck and idiot are from NY. 

Edit maybe not NY. Doesn‚Äôt look like VT plate though. Assumed Bennington being on the border.
I am visiting Bennington this weekend. I swear I have seen the same guy in the confederate flag hat the past two times I have visited. He's mean.
Bennington resident here. Not surprised to see this, one of my neighbors hangs one on their fence. Although as others pointed out this ignorant dickhead is from across the border
As a Vermonter I‚Äôm embarrassed. As someone married to a man born and raised in the Deep South who would never, I have to forward it for a laugh.
trust me, that isn‚Äôt the most embarrassing one i‚Äôve seen.
Not from Vermont (check the license plate).
Not surprised .  The trailer parks have spoken on November 6th and will continue to be obnoxious
Sad. Poor and stupid is no way to go through life. That‚Äôs a crime in many countries and should be here.
People are nuts with downvotes these days lol
Looks like Sherman tore up the tracks on him
Not VT plates
Typical Bennington imo
Must‚Äôve moved the mason dixon line recently
Is this all you guys do on every New England state subreddit? You‚Äôve got nothing better to do?
Flying the flag of the country they want in the country that beat it

They ought to get a real flag
I wonder if they have ever even visited Dixie land?
I see them all over when I visit home in upstate NY.  Just a quick word, they HATE" yankees down here.  Your rebel flag won't make them like you any more.  How do I know?  I've lived in Texas 50 years and I'm still.....and gotdamned yankee.
What state does the plate say?
Bennington, the county that re-elected Mary Morrissey, republican house rep who repeatedly poured water into her legislative colleague's bag during session. Politics aside, the ethical and mental health boundaries crossed over and over again, have been rewarded. Says a lot about Bennington.
Being a rebel with a 10 mpg shit box. Lol
May Generals Grant and Stannard haunt his sorry ass.
There's a giant one on the interstate on the GA/SC border. Rebel flags are just participation trophies for racists who lost. Change my mind... Hate not heritage amirite.
it's embarrassing for us all.
Should be illegal, museums only
The Confederacy lasted THREE YEARS. The only reason to fly that flag is to say HEY, IM A RACIST TRAITOR TO THE CONSTITUTION
You never know when you‚Äôll need toilet paper or surrender.
lol take a drive on 30 through Jamaica
Do they know VT boarders Canada?
Yes all conservatives are low IQ
There's nothing illegal about burning a Confederate flag...
Burn itt
If you go looking for bad things... you are gonna find bad things. They have always existed. Why not relax. Enjoy life a little. For fucks sake.
Free speech.  Just as it is within your right to fly a Nazi flag or burn the US Flag.  The US Supreme Court ruled it ok.  So what‚Äôs the big deal?
Find out who they are - take their pictures- send to employers- publicly treat them as lepers.
those are new york plates on the truck

Where is the plate from?
If only they could hear what most rural southerners think of yankees that fly that flag
They are just duke's of hazard fans.
Someone should tell them that the south lost the war‚Ä¶
trashy
This thread is priceless. I love you all üòÜ ü§£ üòÇ
I brought my confederate flag up here with me in Maine. In my heart. üòò

Nice
Be careful about approaching people like this. Their DNA matches everyone in their family and there are no dental records so they can actually get away with murder...
With a NY plate, probably from HookerFalls
Go kill them... nobody will mind
I saw a redneck looking guy with a Confederate flag hat yesterday in Colchester. I wanted to embarrass him in front of the crowd, but I bit my tongue instead.
I like it
We visited from NYS this weekend and I was shocked at how much racist stuff we saw. Was hoping for a respite from the upstate bigots but I guess it‚Äôs just the whole country.
Gross
I‚Äôve never seen that exact truck but I‚Äôve seen a similar looking Bubba Truck with the huge Confederate flag mounted the same way driving in Western Maine. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§Æ
Maybe his family fought for the south lol
[removed]
Honestly, would the country be any different than it is today if the North had lost the Civil War?  I don‚Äôt think so. Lincoln made the biggest mistake of all time not cutting the Slave States loose.  He made the correct decision in that moment, but look at us now
Im sure they support the traitor. So not really embarrassing for them. Just truthful.

Harris is the best the democrat party could put up against Trump? How embarrassing for them.
Proud racist right there
Why are the people on the left nowadays so anti-freedom of speech/expression? If you want to show off a confederate flag, cool, if you want to show off a lgbtq flag that‚Äôs cool too, you can even have a flag of Pat Mahomes with a schlong in his mouth. You can disagree with the messaging but at the end of the day we live in a democratic republic not a socialist or facist controlled state. You can express however you want Cmon now ü•Ö
Always on a truck in need of some rust removal and a paint job. America first with their made in China flags!
Confederate flag. Trump flag.  Whats the difference?
I heard ol‚Äô Neil put her down‚Ä¶
Well Vermont is full blue state. They All believe the confederate standards

Doesn't he know VT fought for the yanks not johnny Reb?
I don‚Äôt see how burning a US flag and flying a Confederate flag are really any different.
Why is this embarrassing? I don‚Äôt care what they do as long as they aren‚Äôt harming anyone
So many men from Vermont lost their lives in the Civil War. Yet it is mostly men whose families sent their men to fight the rebellion who do this.
Gotta love freedom
Typical Trumper
Pockets of Vermont really show their lack of education and common sense!
that's Bennington for you üôÑ
Modern Confederates are the world's sorest losers.
Not a confederate flag.
They‚Äôre dumb af but they just won. I‚Äôd say how embarrassing for us that we let a bunch of idiot rednecks ruin our country again. Like yeah, they suck and ate stupid and evil, but at least they can find a candidate who fucking tries or appeals to the masses at all? At least their voters go out. The fact that Trump destroyed on the popular vote this time means we lost across the board. It‚Äôs a shameful time to be a liberal and not because of any of our values. We are pathetic, non confrontational, divisive, idiots ourselves. At least those racists band together. All we do is infight and lose. 

We let the brainwashed people take the country. We let it fucking happen. And a bunch of it is because of liberals who secretly hate trans and gay and black people and voted for Trump but claim to be blue.
Depends on why they fly it. Depends on if you understand why the civil war was fought. If your answer is, "Because of slavery"... You should study your history and think for yourself. Civil war wasn't fought over slavery, and Lincoln didn't free a single slave. If you understood the English language when you read the Emancipation Proclamation you'd know this.
Confederate Flag equals rebellion. Used now to show you to be an outsider and non conformist. Same as bikers with SS tattoos.
No. That's historic pride.
Ah, glad to see you have at least one educated person in Vermont.
Feel free to tear down any confederate flags flying in New England. They are an insult to the brave men who fought and died  to preserve the union and to whom many a monument stands in nearly every town.
confederate in the northern states? not even bros ancestors agree with that shit
It‚Äôs history?
Why do people care so much about how others live their lives? Is he physically harming you or your family? Did you die from seeing a piece of fabric? Who really gives a shit. The world would be so much better if people just minded their own business and chilled the fuck out
Not as embarrassing as a Harris flag!
I love the south and that big beautiful flag ‚ô•Ô∏è
That‚Äôs not a VT plate. It looks Texan but don‚Äôt quote me on that, it‚Äôs a 7 character black and white plate and the image is blurry. I have many doubts that that is a Vermonter.
Get used to it. It will only get worse.
Trump scum
Bennington is trash.
Get a fucking life holy shit lmao.
I mean, it is a Democrat flag, seems right at home to me.
His intent worked. He got a rise out of you. 

Instead of insulting someone that thinks differently than you, try asking ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù.

* Why does he display that flag?
* What does that flag mean to him?

Conservative culture today is a backlash to generations of insults and being told their opinions are backward and therefore don‚Äôt matter. It‚Äôs why conservatives view liberals as elitist. 

He‚Äôs not embarrassed to fly that flag, he‚Äôs proud. To him, it probably represents the culture he‚Äôs been raised in. Insulting his IQ only perpetuates that backlash mindset and breeds more division in this country.

If we want to move towards unity, we need to do better than this.
It's more about what the flag has come to represent, rather than what it once represented
I don't know...seems low IQ and petty to take a picture and post it on social media.
Not a big deal. You‚Äôll live bro
Definitely a flatlander
I honestly have to guess that it's more embarrassing to you than it is to them. 

I don't understand the whole aspect of trying to publicly shame someone that we disagree with though.

If I don't really know a person, I can't conclude if they are a good person or a bad person. Just because they may look at things differently than me doesn't make them a bad person. Just my humble opinion.
It‚Äôs not embarrassing for them and if you don‚Äôt understand that then that‚Äôs on you.
It's not people have different reasons for flying the flag
Yeah democrats need to accept the loss. I don‚Äôt know why democrats still fly their confederate flags, especially right after they just lost an election
You didn't get the memo. White trash is everywhere
On Veterans Day no less
Who cares. Mind your business ü§°
They are still representing the democrat party! Good for them
Would you say the same thing if you saw a pride flag?  

Remember people.. these are just someone else's opinions in a nation of Free speech and inclusion.  If you stand for one you stand for all.. not just the speech you agree with..

I'd say the same thing if I saw a car rolling around with a pride flag, however, being that in the current climate it's not acceptable for me to have that opinion, you will all get angry and call me names.. how is that any different from what was always done towards LGBTQ?  

So if you are unwilling to be accepting towards everyone and allow them their Freedoms without hating them.. then please... Be silent and hate internally, we don't want to hear it..
That flag is less racist than the Democratic Party.
The South will rise again ü§£
Embarrassing that your posting someone's license plate. Move on with your day.
The thing is not everybody has sat through college courses and have been indoctrinated to understanding why or how this is racist. I agree that it is racist, but shaming these people and mocking them is only making the problem worse.
Freedom of speech..I love it
You should go confront him face-to-face. 

Aww.

Yeah they should bury this old symbol of the democratic party.
Apparently you missed it. It's cool to be racist again... Bring back the 19th century, yah üòú

I find it pathetic people form their opinions based on what msnbc and cnn tell them to think instead of actually educating themselves.
They don't seem embarrassed. I'd be embarrassed to be so uptight over a flag ... bet you love the rainbow one though ... right?

Manipulated sheep!
Oooo.  Scary free speech!
nowadays the flag has no hate behind it which is the reason they fly it even though the confederacy lost the war. the flag has a bad history but it's more of a southern pride flag now

edit: people are basically trying to change the meaning of the flag to mean your heritage and stuff, not hate, most of the guys flying the flags probably aren't racist and just are from the south and appreciate the south, a good example of this is dimebag darrell
No different than BLM or The alphabet mafia flag (trans)

Yea well, on another note‚Ä¶ I feel like this was planned somehow but my brain is melting trying to sort out how‚Ä¶
Making fun of them is pointless. They don‚Äôt read Reddit and don‚Äôt care. If you want to make a difference, make there be consequences for THEM.
And at least they are happy to identify  their dumb asses.

Oohh like Johnny Rebel?
Was she working at a gas station? I think I might know the girl you are talking about.
I used to work with a dishwasher from VT that had "the south will rise again" overlaid on a confederate flag tattooed down his arm.
The confederate flag stuff is pretty common in Vermont
I don‚Äôt know why this caused me to remember, but our local Pop Warner football team was called the Rebels and had a Confederate flag as a team emblem. This was in New Jersey in the 70s. At that time, as a kid, it didn‚Äôt mean anything to me (especially because I wasn‚Äôt a sports kid). 

I would even go as far to say that it didn‚Äôt signify what it does today to the majority of people continuing to wield it as a symbol; it just meant ‚Äúrebellious‚Äù in our overwhelmingly white area. I had completely forgotten about this until now.
Because nothing says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a rebel‚Äù like owning other people as property.
I always say their family tree is more of a wreath than a tree.

Bro some of yall are literally so low iq considering how highly educated you proclaim to be. The population on Earth legitimately at one point was down to around 20,000 total after the dormant super volcanoes had erupted millennia ago. To call one group of people today the clan of incest when we all come from those 20,000 people and are likely all the product of multiple incest birth chains is in my humble opinion‚Ä¶ a little redundant to say the least üåã
Family tree of traitors. Unless of course since this is a Vermont subreddit his ancestors fought for the Union. They would be disgraced
Yes. The Whitehall area is full of these failures.
Unfortunately lots of people in NY who are from the sticks are wannabe confederate rebels.

They usually live in a half-collapsed house. Likely held up by some beams to keep their porch from collapsing in. Tyvek wrapping at least one of the sides of their home. At least 3 different half-broke-down pickup trucks leaking oil into their front yard. Multiple "posted" signs, probably a "warning: attack dog sign" and at least one sign alluding to the fact they will be happy to shoot you and hide your body if you so much as sneeze over the property line. Nobody in the household over 20 has all their teeth.

Source - grew up there unfortunately lol
A Confederate flag?  
At this time of year?  
At this time of day?    
Located entirely within a state that was never a part of the confederacy?  
Yes.  
May I see it?  
YES. NOT ONLY AM I VERY STUPID, BUT ALSO INCREDIBLY LOUD ABOUT MY DUMB ASS OPINIONS.
Alongside a Marine flag? I can definitely believe that!
I bet he was a navy seal in the Marine Core, enlisted into West Point at 16, graduated top of his class and got commissioned as a master chief in the air force.
Once traitors, and will always will a traitor to the country
VERMONTSTER AAAAAA
True but if you go up to the NEK plenty of people are flying that flag outside their houses and whatnot
Some parts of CNY host reich parties
I expect to see a "Keep Vermont White" bumper sticker someday soon.
I've been considering moving to Vermont recently.   Seeing someone reference Poppers work like this and then seeing it up voted is helping seal the deal for me
So pop off already cupcake.
I‚Äôll take things that didn‚Äôt happen for 1000 Alex
That definitely didn't happen.
Disgusting
Those cemeteries are so pretty. One of my favorite aspects of rustic New England.
Drove from Albany to Mt Washington and back this weekend. You'd never know they are all blue states by driving through the back roads.
I can‚Äôt shake the same feeling. We saw all this shit get bolder the last time *he* was in office and I can‚Äôt imagine restraint coming back this second time.

EDIT: I would have left it as ‚Äúher‚Äù if the grammar wasn‚Äôt burning a hole in my side.
I refuse to.  The media will continue trying to sane-wash him and the dark, dangerous place he's taking our country to, and they'll try to depict his supporters as decent, hard-working folks who are just sick with worry about the direction our country was headed.  I refuse to go along with any of it.  I will never, ever consider things like Confederate flags displayed on New England soil even remotely "normal".

You don‚Äôt even need to go to NEK. I‚Äôve turned down the wrong road in Brandon (literally) and a lot of people feel comfortable flying the confederate flag there.
franklin county says hello
Nope, and could care less too - it‚Äôs all red up by the border (uneducated and poor) but cheap old houses falling apart - check them out on realtor.com
Not since 2021
There was no peace treaty because there was no declaration of war. It was a civil war, an internal conflict. The US can‚Äôt declare war on its own states so there is no treaty signed as well. The conflict ends when the fighting ends. It‚Äôs over. There are no Confederates to kill legally or otherwise.

Anyone who flies that flag is an idiot at best. I‚Äôm sorry you have to live among them down there.
They do desperately need attention 
  don‚Äôt they
That it‚Äôs ok to enslave and murder people you don‚Äôt like / are different / etc‚Ä¶
Using!
There's a big difference between "that's a bad thing to do and you shouldn't do it", and "the State should compell people to curtail their speech". Free speech doesn't insulate you from the consequences of your speech, such as people thinking you're vile.
How many people are vermonters today? Most of the state is 1st or 2nd gen.  All transplants from CT NYC NJ and Eastern Mass.  They have ruined the state with their far left ideals.  State voted blue once from 1791-1992.  Fairly positive in this chat most are not real vermonters.
Yup! Nazis commies and racist poor folk being turned on the ‚Äòother‚Äô ; those others can‚Äôt have as much as us‚Ä¶
There's an orchard in Isle La Motte proudly flying one next to their farm stand. North to south, we're not free of racists by any stretch of the imagination.
After World War II we went to great lengths to stamp out any lingering pro-Nazi sentiment as a condition of rebuilding the country and allowing it to reenter into normal international relations.  But with our own civil war, we half-assed Reconstruction, ended it prematurely, and have let these sick freaks nurse their grievances for 160 years, still to this day thinking their cause was just and their defeat a tragedy.  They've been like a millstone around the neck of our country ever since.
Sad. Surprise, I‚Äôm your neighborhood racist just out to show that I‚Äôm a big man
Take that green house emissions and oil / general inflation!
Where specifically? I live here and haven't seen confederate flags. Genuinely curious not saying you're wrong
Ya, that‚Äôs where the militias are standing by; tons of guns from white southerners go there; they have hard core bike gangs (criminal) / it can get almost as bad there - up in Quebec the ‚Äòothers‚Äô are the anglophones (non French speaking originally from England)
Unlikely.
Not all. Some are just evil.
People who fly a Southern rebel flag in a state that fought against them are dumb, yes. If you equate that with all conservatives that's on you

edit: that being said, that looks like a white plate. NH?
Only the poor uneducated ones; there are actually gay conservatives but we shun them because they are self loathing AND usually rich
[deleted]
I deeply enjoy my life even when bad things find me
Because it's moral and ethical to fight bad things?

There /is/ bad in the world. They didn't go looking for someone to be flying a symbol representing the tratior's cause in defense of slavery. They didn't mount that flag to that truck.

But when you see bad shit, it's completely right and good to say, "hey! that's unacceptable shit!"
No, now is the time to resist. Not going back and not ignoring the hate EITHER ‚Ä¶
  RESIST THE RIGHT
Plenty of things are legal that people should be shamed for
Because ‚Ä¶ it's still bad?

Like, the government should not step in and prevent it, sure, but ‚Ä¶ I'm not the government, and fuck that guy.

It's a big deal because allowing these people to fly divisive signals of hatred has a cost to lots of people, and myself. I don't want racists to be comfortable flying flags like this, and I don't want other people to see them flying flags like this and realize they won't get any pushback.
It‚Äôs hate speech to those who escaped slavery! Next you‚Äôll be saying it was a fight over states rights lol - just plain ignorance
Hey, whatEVER works - fight hate with intolerance of hate ; shame on their ignorance they should be educated
They‚Äôre feeling safe enough to come out of the woodwork
Oh!  And I was driving my little honda!!!
‚ÄúHe made the correct decision in that moment, but look at us now‚Äù‚Ä¶? Up until that last sentence I thought you might have been sarcastic. What?
Very unrelated but you‚Äôre not wrong lol
BahhahahahüòÇ
You are not wrong. They have every right. It‚Äôs better than F you N‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ I suppose or similar examples of other derogatory hate speech towards minorities or immigrants. I mean to have it for heritage in the south is one thing and a partial excuse (that‚Äôs where I live now currently and am from), but to be rocking it in the north out in public is a direct statement of where they might have stood back in the civil war‚Ä¶
When you think abt the bigger picture, and have a broader scope of the relevance of the confederate symbol, what it means, and it‚Äôs history, it‚Äôs resurgence in the 80s with a revamp of far right communist ideology, you‚Äôd understand how this is harmful to someone‚Äôs psyche when they see it. Signed someone from the south
The piece of fabric indicates they most likely wish harm on a certain group of people. Like idgaf about trumpies. but we really need to start stamping this confederate and nazi shit out.
No! We won‚Äôt go back and we won‚Äôt shut our pie holes - in fact we may make you a very special pie a chocolate one with an added ingredient
It's bad ‚Äì actually ‚Äì to let people promote hated and division without making some noise about it.

This isn't, like, "I want to smoke some pot" where people should mind their own business because it doesn't really affect them. Or "if you think you see someone shoplifting, no you didn't".

This is someone /intentionally/ flying a symbol of hated and traitorous rebellion in the service of the perpetuation of chattel slavery.
Finally, someone with some common sense. üíØ
The flag that represents states that fought a war, which killed hundreds of thousands of Americans, is somehow better to you.. than an inept, shitty politician *that lost*? 

Get a grip.

Are you from the south? I do love the south. And do not love how the far right neo-nazi punk f*cks have revamped its fascist racist as symbolism in recent years.

Nope / not going back

Wow, a lot of emotion it stirs‚Ä¶ 
  Makes you feel , hurt that people are FIGHTING HATE?!  
  We need to resist this nonsense and let them know it‚Äôs not ok here
It's not a "Democrat" flag, you numpty.
 No. There's no benefit of the doubt.
That is the North. 
The North won against their inbred traitor neighbors. 
The inbred Southerners killed many thousands of our ancestors, protected slavery, and then practiced Jim Crow for decades.
That symbol doesn't belong in the North. It probably doesn't belong in the South.
I love Skynyrd and the Allmans. In fact, their music feels more appropriate in Vermont. But fuck the Confederacy and anyone who reps the flag for whatever reason. It is ignorance exemplar.
Hey the IQ comment was uncalled for, fair, and it did piss me off when I saw it but IMO being pissed off at a confederate flag is warranted. It‚Äôs a symbol of racism and hate, and if he doesn‚Äôt know that, that‚Äôs on him.
I refuse to unify with the rebel scum.

Nah, it's more common than you might think, and it's not just people from elsewhere. Many of our racists are homegrown.
It represents the exclusion of non-white people and pro-slavery. I reckon that should tell you enough about someone being a good person or not.
Being publicly pro-slavery is embarrassing. For them.
Sure, they‚Äôre so-called Christian hypocrites or bigots - no defense either way

This is true - thankfully at the flag of ye olde wealthy slave owner Democratic Party. The switchover happened decades ago, so while the people and sentiment are the same vile sh1t, the party has swapped so it‚Äôs been Republican for a long time.

But you knew that.

Though it‚Äôs less loud and not straight up using racist terminology, it still represents and symbolizes hate. Check out the history of the confederate flags resurgence alongside the revamp of communist ideology of nationalism of the far right in 80s, or maybe you already are aware, I honestly have no idea.
> but it's more of a southern pride flag now 

I know people /want/ this to be true, but it's really hard to separate it from its history.

It's like putting up a bunch of Nazi swastika flags and claiming they're really about east-asian religion. That simply is not a reasonable argument.
This may be the dumbest comment I've read in this sub all year.   But then again, -50 karma says it all
Let's see‚Ä¶

- The Confederacy was predicated on rejecting the Union to uphold the institution of slavery.

- BLM is asking for less extrajudicial murder and police action against Black people, which /regularly/ happens at higher rates.

- LGBTQIA+ folks are asking for basic social respect and the freedom to live their lives.

A lot of them have a very set routine because I've noticed the same thing. I did roadside clean up once in my town and it blew my mind. I didn't realize how much people littered, but when we got to the less populated area with backroads where the rednecks primarily lived it was worse. And almost all shitty beer cans. We could tell some areas it was from one person because they were almost in a pile. Set up a game camera and you can probably catch them.

Yep, my girlfriend is from Upstate and moved back after college.  We both mentioned that we'd noticed this phenomenon when discussing which one of us should move one day (surprise surprise, she'll be coming home to New England).  Like it's not like we're totally bereft of shitty people and crumbling houses on this side of Lake Champlain, but there's a certain limit to what we tolerate in terms of overt racism and visible social decay.  Upstate New York does not have any such limit.  There are of course similarities to Vermont, especially near the border, but everything west of us just feels more...American, and I absolutely mean that as an insult.
Omg as someone who was house shopping in the Deep South with a very small budget this sounds pretty authentic to some of the rural areas we looked that had rebel flags as/in front of their front doors. The New Yorkers are recreating their dream of rural poverty in a state that won‚Äôt actually let them starve or go without medical care. How brave.

Right. Native American, French, English, and a smattering of others. State Line Identity always cracks me up. We are so many different things in the USA - and the one consistent aspect is we‚Äôre all from somewhere else. Except aforementioned first peoples.

[This article](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/04/why-conservatives-love-defending-the-confederate-flag.html) is a few years old, but Conservatives haven‚Äôt changed their stance much since then, aside from digging their heels in a bit deeper.
Haha that ‚ÄúI‚Äôll wait‚Äù thing people do online is so fucking stupid. And it looks like someone answered you pretty quickly, so you didn‚Äôt have to wait long! lol
Well it doesn‚Äôt work that way.  Free speech  is for everyone.  Sometimes it is offensive to some but not to others.  Why do we want the government to step in?  We are not a communist country nor is this Nazi Germany.  The government is powerless based on the Supreme Courts decision, and it certainly isn‚Äôt the police‚Äôs role either.

Best advice:  suck it up and move along, it‚Äôs not worth your time or energy.
Or, you quit worrying so much about stuff that doesn‚Äôt matter. That flag isn‚Äôt hurting you, your ideas are hurting you.  

- another feller from the south
Blacks in the south also waive the flag. It‚Äôs  been taught as a symbol of hate as a symbol , but that‚Äôs not its purpose .
You‚Äôre still assuming what the flag means to him, projecting your beliefs about it onto him. For better or worse, a good portion of this country no longer connects that flag to slavery and racism.
I'm glad you enjoy being part of the problem. I, on the other hand, would prefer to work towards a solution.
It's a Democrat flag, republicans took it down and put up the US Flag.  You're just a useful idiot.
Storytime: i made and sold hot sauce in New England festivals, fairs and expos from 2013 to 2018. Any time I was put next to one of those big merch tents that sell shirts, hats, buckles, rugs and flags, I asked what their best seller is.

And every single one told me the same thing: the confederate flag.

People from CT, MA and Rhode Island? Yep. Buying teeshirts, vanity plates, flags, rugs, bedsheets, posters of Confederate flags. It runs out first. In a 4 day state fair, they would sell those out before the end of day 2.

And for whatever reason usually white teenage girls and white men in their 20s buying them.

One proprietor speculated that the girls were buying it to be rebellious, and the boys were buying it for image of being tough. Another vendor said they don‚Äôt call it a confederate flag; they market it as a ‚ÄúRebel Flag‚Äù
That's too bad, I never saw much overt racism like this in some of the rural areas I grew up in but that was a long time ago and just one area.
Not faulting you on your thoughts or opinions. Just stating your making a conclusion based mostly on conjecture with your response to my post. 
The reality is that every flag in the world has different meaning to different people. 
I don't personally believe in lumping people into categories or groups unless they verbally proclaim an association to or with said category or group.
Only an idiot would think everyone who flys a Rebel Battle Flag is pro slavery. That's not to say these people aren't, but that's def not the case.
It‚Äôs literally their flag‚Ä¶?
The most racist people I know are all Democrats. Seems nothing has changed.
I think they're under the impression that we're all going to be forced to stop laughing at them now that their rapist-messiah has been reelected.
I do not support that flag nor do i support the BLM flag or the alphabet mafia flag.  All have the right to fly. Funny thing about the left they do not believe in the 1st amendment unless it supports their narrative.  I think the United States spoke about this last Tuesday. 

Question:  do you think BLM & Alphabet Mafia should be flown in schools?

no. it should be offensive.
sure, 'everybody is too offended today...'
not enough Northerners are offended. Our spooky old New England cemeteries are filled with Union soldiers whose courage and sacrifice saved the Union.
Viewing the flag with indifference shows a problem that is separate from racism: a lack of pride in our country and a failure to appreciate any virtue in our past.
Because letting people get away with shit like this without voicing opprobium is how other people come to understand that /they/ won't get any pushback either, and [will keep pushing the boundaries into very bad territory.](https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/12/us/michigan-nazi-flags-anne-frank-theater/index.html) cf. also Charlottesville Unite the Right "tiki-torch" rally.

So I'm not sure what you're responding to.

> Well it doesn‚Äôt work that way. Free speech is for everyone.

It does work this way. People can fly their stupid-as-fuck flags. And I don't think they government should compel them to not do so. But it is entirely appropriate, and in fact ethically required, for /other/ people to tell them they're absolute pieces of shit for doing it, and we won't allow such things.
Conservative culture should not be associated with pre-civil war racism. It is ridiculous and asinine to presume everyone that is conservative is racist. This type of thinking is what alienates over 70+ million people in this country.  There are a lot of conservative people in the northeast who are not racist and tying them to this bullshit propaganda that has been spread has pissed them off so much, that they voted unanimously for someone who may not be perfect for the job.
Look at you whitesplaining the Confederate flag! Everyone gets their own meaning, and for this guy it might just be a fashion statement! He's an artist!

Fuck every single person who bought that merch.
all of those yogi's flying a swastika flag must surely be nazi's.
The singular important cause and driver for the Civil War is not represented by the primary symbol of the traitor's cause?

We've 180 years to figure this out. People who fly this flag are flying it in support of racism and slavery. That is what the cause represented, and thus what the flag represents.

You joke, but the reality is they probably won't, because even in an emergency usually takes 45 min to an hour for the cops and stuff to show up anyway. 

More likely to try to speed race their best-condition jalopy at 95 mph on the main roads towards the nearest hospital tbh. 

I've seen it before lol will never know if they're all in an emergency but I've seen em cruising pretty good always assumed they were either headed to the hospital or out of beer. One of the two.
The part about it that‚Äôs extra insane to me is that if you are in an actual self defense situation but you have signs all over saying how eager you are to kill someone, a prosecutor is a lot more likely to go after you than if you‚Äôre just a normal person who had to defend themselves.

Forgive me for asking people to take a step back and stop making things worse.
I will reiterate the theme from my original comment: You are projecting your belief of what that symbol represents onto someone else without allowing for dialog, perpetuating the division.

That symbol literally is a relic from the confederacy. Its modern use was created and perpetuated by white supremacy groups and the kkk under the guise of "rebel culture". 

Look into the history of post civil war reconstruction. Anyone who thinks it's an innocuous symbol either bought a big lie, or is just playing dumb.

Where do you draw the line? Of he had kkk symbols or a black sun on his truck would you still want to create dialog?
You might want to read that again; I don't think it's quite the defense you think it is.

The thesis is here:

> In the postwar era, they note, the South transformed itself from a backward region to an engine of the national economy, giving rise to a sizable new wealthy suburban class. This class, not surprisingly, began to vote for the party that best represented its economic interests: the G.O.P. Working-class whites, however -- and here's the surprise -- even those in areas with large black populations, stayed loyal to the Democrats. (This was true until the 90s, when the nation as a whole turned rightward in Congressional voting.)

So ‚Ä¶ the argument is that the land-owning aristocrats in the south moved from D to R. Which is exacatly what that says. And the white working class and black population stayed with the Democratic party. Which is exactly what is supported by the southern strategy.

The bulk of the previously-Dem population moved to the Republicans because of their focus on "State's rights" (and (sometimes-not-even-)crypto-racism). And the working class population did not.

In any case: fundamentally the nature of the parties changed.

correct and so horrible.
Personally, I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre going to get there as one country. 

We‚Äôve created division to the point that no one listens to each other anymore. Facts and opinions are no longer discernibly distinct from one another. Assumptions are made based on looks before even trying to understand. 

Case in point, getting downvoted for even suggesting that the guy in the picture may have a sliver of credibility or humanity.
I am neither uneducated on the history of that flag nor do I believe it should be displayed in any manner, public or private. I am merely stating, as someone with extensive exposure to people who choose to display that flag, that their understanding of it does not match yours. Labeling them as fools who "bought a big lie" or disingenuous in their beliefs discounts part of their identity and only strengthens their resolve.
Your source was a Wikipedia article 

Look, you clearly don‚Äôt know history and that‚Äôs okay.

Carbon emissions are going to ruin the planet.

It is in our collective benefit to reduce carbon usage. One way to do that is to appropriately price carbon emissions to reflect it's true societal cost.

> Every American should have the choice to choose whether they want to use a vehicle that is powered by gas, electricity or unicorn farts.

This is simply nonsense.

The entire developed world banned leaded fuel because it was literaling killing people and making them more violent. We told companies to stop polluting due to rivers literally on fire and acid raid. We banned CFCs because it was tearing a hole in the ozone layer. We're phasing out incandescent and CFC lights because they're wicked inefficient. We mandate all sorts of safety devices on cars because they reduces the rates of death. We have consumer-protection agencies to help identify and mandate solutions to problems that individual consumers can not. We have a Federal Trade Commission and Food and Drug Administration to do the same in their domains, so ‚Äì like ‚Äì only dozens of people die of listeria, not thousands.

We live in a society, and we do certain things through our elected representatives because they are problems of collective ‚Äì not individual ‚Äì action.

You're arguing some extreme form of libertarian individualism that's fundamentally wrong; grow up.
Yeah, it‚Äôs very disheartening, I agree.
Lol, sure thing buddy.

The wikipedia article is well-sourced.

You can‚Äôt  just phase out oil comrade. That‚Äôs not how the world works
I'm no "comrade". :P

We are phasing out oil, though. And we can, and must continue to.

And a way to do it is to quantify the cost of the externalities it creates via taxes.

But my point was more so: we do in fact make changes to the world via the collective action of democratic representation when it's necessary, and this is so necessary.
1939 Edition of ‚ÄúOut of Vermont Kitchens‚Äù: found in my grandma‚Äôs house
The 1944 printing. Complete with handwritten recipes, illustrations and some neat pictures of landmarks.
What a beautiful find -- the sketches are amazing! Do you think it's in good enough shape it could be carefully scanned? I bet your local Historical Society would love to get a digital copy.
take this on over to r/oldrecipes, they will love it! This is a very cool find, love the penmanship and the little emoji like graphics in the twisty rolls!
Oh the hand drawn ads! Love the Pico Peak one. I remember spending the night sleeping in the basement of that church with the Episcopal youth group and I had to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night and I walked in on the two chaperones having adult fun time.
As a sixth generation Vermonter, how is this the first time I‚Äôm hearing about pork cake?
God I love how they phrase instructions in old cook books.

‚ÄúYeah just cook all that stuff together don‚Äôt mess it up.‚Äù
Shrimp casserole‚Ä¶ classic Vermont cuisine.
Didn't you see that it was copyrighted in 1939? Now you've put that material all OVER the Internet. You wouldn't download a cake, would you? 

I'm sure the Internet police will be there soon.
Oooh! I think there is a copy of that at my parents house. I will have to look next time I go.
I teared up on page 269, my mom had the EXACT same hand writing!
I‚Äôm a Vermonter, this is awesome! Thanks for sharing.
this is such a gem! it's like finding a time capsule of flavor. the handwritten notes just add so much personality...
Wow will you believe me if I tell you my mom, who was from Johnson, had the same book!!
That‚Äôs awesome ‚ù§Ô∏è
I will have to try pork cake. I bet bacon could be substitute.
What an awesome find!!!
[deleted]
You‚Äôre joking. I saw this at goodwill a while ago and didn‚Äôt get it and I‚Äôm kicking myselfüò≠
Was born in Rutland, VT and love history, so I found tgis post to be awesome! Thank you for sharing and even bigger thank you for the pics
Nothing like that old mountain recipe of shrimp casserole. üç§ü•ò
I screenshot that maple parfait.  Thanks!  üçÅ
That handwriting though‚Ä¶!
Wow this is awesome
Someone send this to B. Dylan Hollis
Beautiful find! Delicious dishes in there too.... üòã
My husband‚Äôs family lived in Burlington for generations! What a beautiful book
I have a very similar book from the 1950s - Fanny Allen in Colchester
We have this same book in our North Hero cabin! It‚Äôs such a neat piece of history!
I've got an old copy of ma's country cookbook
Rutland Vermont? I bet my grandparents could have had copies of this at some point. So weird seeing things like this cause every now and then you find stuff that‚Äôs near where you are and being so use to things on here being cross the globe. It‚Äôs an interesting feeling to have something so close.
It‚Äôs actually in fantastic condition! The cover is the only part that‚Äôs a little fragile. There‚Äôs some stains on a couple of the pages (I think I know what recipes my grandma liked the best) but for being 80 years old, it‚Äôs in good shape.
It‚Äôs still in print
There really is a subreddit for everything
What a special and timeless memory ü§£ü§£
I have also never heard of pork cake. I make a lot of different foods so I‚Äôll have to try this one. I know I‚Äôve seen salt pork at Price Chopper so it‚Äôll be one more experiment!
Me too! What is a citron. Like the fruit?
Consider yourself lucky?! ;)
The recipes didn‚Äôt scream Vermont to me.
My Grandmother‚Äôs Apple Pie recipe starts, in her beautiful writing on a pastel pink card with butterflies on a corner, ‚Äú1. Go to store and buy 2 frozen crusts (don‚Äôt bother making your own - too much time).‚Äù
Those Vermont fisherman worked tirelessly to bring in the shrimp catch from the sea ü•≤
The ghosts of the trinity mission and women‚Äôs service league will have my head for this.
I had the same exact reaction to page 197.  Looks exactly like my grandma‚Äôs handwriting ‚ù§Ô∏è
it's been through many editions and printings, I've seen several copies of it.
Salt pork and bacon are pretty interchangeable. Salt pork usually doesn‚Äôt have the smoky flavor that bacon has, but if you are using regular, store bought, bacon it should be nearly indistinguishable. (If you are using a locally smoked bacon, it will still work, just have a different flavor)
I think it actually might say 1 can of shrimp! The line above it says to add one can tomatoes, and Mrs. Dunaway's "n" appears identical to her "u"
I live for savory baking so I looked into this today. This was helpful: 
https://www.ohs.org/blog/pork-cake.cfm

What‚Äôs interesting is I think the recipe you have will make a better cake. Salt pork is perfect for this type of thing as it‚Äôs basically a slightly sweet pork belly. Not to mention, I think the instructions included in this recipe are really just about how to keep your batter wet/cake moist so if you combine with the above recipe, it should be a great cake. 

We‚Äôll see! Let me know if you track this. I‚Äôll DM you my final results if I try it out. I‚Äôm curious too!!
Yep, it‚Äôs a heartier, dryer lemon. It makes sense as it‚Äôll bring out the warming spices without making it like pork-lemon cake (gross).
You know why there are no shrimp in Lake Champlain? Because of this recipe.
I'm craving brown bread w/ ghram flower, butter, and tomato conserve. Old school New England food, yum.
I agree. In the 1940s, frozen foods were much less available than they are today. (Home refrigerators had tiny freezer compartments). Canned shrimp would have been the most available form.
I'll DM you my result too!
Bad time living in vermont 
I know this is going to get downvoted and people are going to be mad, but I have had an extraordinarily bad time living in Vermont.

I live in Bennington and work in Sunderland. From the start, people (particularly in the northern areas) were cold and standoffish with me. Now, I lived in the Czech Republic, so cold strangers is nothing new to me, but people in VT seemed downright judgmental. When I hold the door for people a the Stewart‚Äôs in Arlington, they don‚Äôt say thank you. When I get a drink at Ramunto‚Äôs in Bennington, people stare at me like I‚Äôm some murderer. I‚Äôve made a couple friends, but generally people are rude and make me feel unwelcomed. It‚Äôs as if they‚Äôve never seen a new face before. When people in Manchester hear that I live in Bennington, they treat me like I‚Äôm som kind of criminal.

I‚Äôve experienced a lot of theft as well. Again, I‚Äôve lived in places like Detroit and Milwaukee and never had anything. In Bennington, some random person crashed into my car my car while it was parked and totaled it. When I got a new car, someone smashed the window, stole my stereo, and left cigarettes ashes everywhere. I know this can happen anywhere, but nothing as extreme has happened to me before. It‚Äôs extremely isolating. 

For the past year, I‚Äôve been vaguely sick all the time. I‚Äôve felt dizzy and like I couldn‚Äôt breathe properly, and my bloodwork was all messed up. Come to find out that there was a hole
in my apartment roof and the ceiling was covered in black mold. I had to go stay at a motel for a couple weeks and some asshole broke into my car and stole all my clothes. 

To add to all that, you can‚Äôt get anything without driving at least 30 minutes to an hour. Want Wendy‚Äôs? Drive to Troy. Live in Arlington and want a reasonably priced grocery store? Go to Bennington. 

Just a gripe, but people take their local town politics WAY TOO seriously. The people in Manchester spent a full two hours debating about the color of open signs outside of businesses. Like, who the fuck cares?

I moved to VT for work and I fucking regret it. My health is compromised, I‚Äôm down a full car, much of my belongings have been stolen, and I‚Äôm just sad. If you‚Äôre in your 20s/30s and you‚Äôre thinking of moving to VT by yourself for work or something, just don‚Äôt. Take a vacation and go skiing if you wish, but don‚Äôt commit to moving here. I understand that all this shit could happen anywhere, but the fact that it‚Äôs only ever happened me in VT says something.
I wouldn't recommend most of Vermont for a 20 something unless you love a rural lifestyle or your life focuses around outdoor activities. Yeah, Bennington is kind of dumpy depending on where you live (guessing you're in some old ass cut up house/apartment building downtown). Might be worth trying to find a better rental and neighborhood. Vermont is a great place for raising a family, but can be very tough for 20s 30s folks trying to start their career and set roots.
I'm sorry for the crummy time you've had. Sounds like it's been very difficult. Try to stay strong.
Listen to this guy. Don't move to VT!
I moved close to you three years ago.  Haven't made any friends either. Acquaintances i see at thw bar and am friendly with, sure.  But nobody to go see a movie my wife doesn't want to see with.  Want to hit a movie in Bennington some time?
I‚Äôm sorry you had a tough time here.  One man‚Äôs paradise is another‚Äôs nightmare.  I hope you find your place, it‚Äôs a great opportunity to set yourself up for the next phase!  Good luck to you!
As a born and raised Vermonter, I'm sorry to hear you're having a rough go of it.  Vermont isn't for everyone, and as a lot of others have stated it's what you make of it. Have you tried joining any of your local committees or clubs?  Are you an active member of your community? Those are good places to start. If you're expecting people to welcome you with open arms just because you're a new face, don't hold your breath. 

If your job allows, maybe look further north. Franklin County and the NEK have some of the kindest, salt of the earth people I've ever met and I've lived in many other states. Like anything else though, you get out of it what you put into it.  Make an effort to get to know your community and maybe you'll see that it's not as bad as you think. 

I don't mean this to be rude, but why would you move to a very rural state then complain about the lack of convenience?  That's what most of us love about Vermont! There are plenty of other places to live in the USA where everything is easily accessible, it doesn't have to be that way here as well.

Hoping it turns around for you and you're able to find some positives in your life.
"I live in Bennington".....well that is your problem right there
Personally, I'd like that people take small town politics seriously.  They'll likely let less corruption slide.

Sorry you got your belongings stolen, I've been there too and that shit sucks.
[deleted]
Yeah Bennington sucks.
Sorry you‚Äôre having a bad experience but I moved to Vermont 3 years ago and I have been loving it. I‚Äôm in the Chittenden county, I live 15 mins away from Wendy‚Äôs , KFC, Walmart, target, McDonald‚Äôs, etc . I‚Äôm a person of color and the people here are extremely friendly. Doors are being held open for me when I‚Äôm no where close to the building. It just depends on the area you are in tbh. If you want to see for yourself, spend the day or two in the Burlington/south Burlington/williston area and see if it‚Äôs a good fit for you
I moved to VT and left after two years. Just wasn‚Äôt for me and my partner.. no shame
All of New England is very stand off-ish and that is coming from a Vermonter.
Dude, I hear you.  None of this sounds shocking, and I have experienced some of these things myself.  Unfortunately, when this comes up, even in a polite way, many seem to get defensive or explain why it's wrong, and don't even want to listen or try to understand that experience. 

 I do feel that in Vermont, people are willing to help a stranger in need--someone will usually stop if you're on the side of the road type of thing.  But I agree that overall, people don't come across as outwardly friendly and aren't inviting.  I've found a lot of judgemental too. There is this reputation that everyone in Vermont is so friendly, and that hasn't been my experience overall. It is often very hard for people moving into the state to meet people or find more than acquaintances.    Though I'm sure many here will disagree.
Native here. I think it's harder for translants. I always wonder why people come. lol I am moving further up north but I also have an insanely good job and I am okay with this way of life. I visit big cities and enjoy coming home to the quiet after.
>I know this is going to get downvoted and people are going to be mad, but

No one hates this state more than the commentors on r/vermont youll be in good company lol.
Having lived in Bennington for ~18 months, I have to say i have experienced none of the things you have. I'm sorry you are having a crappy time here. I know Bennington has problem areas, just like everywhere else. It sounds like you are in one of those areas? that sucks, and I can't really provide any solid advice.

As for "you can‚Äôt get anything without driving at least 30 minutes to an hour. Want Wendy‚Äôs? Drive to Troy." that doesn't seem like a very valid complaint. That should have been pretty obvious before you moved here. Want Wendy's? Just get Burger King instead... If you want every single fast food choice of your preference on your doorstep, you won't find that here. 

It would have been better to restrict your post to your real, valid concerns. going off on a tangent to the tired, generic complaints of "Vermont isn't like the place I came from, it should change" isn't going to win over many sympathetic ears.
My understanding is that mold can really do a number on your mind and health, I‚Äôm really sorry this is going on for you. I feel like sometimes waiting on good friends to come into one‚Äôs life can be agony, but once they arrive, it feels worth the wait. Don‚Äôt give up‚Äîwelcome here.
People are strange when you‚Äôre a stranger
So there‚Äôs this Vermont farmer out in his dooryard working on his tractor. A guy with a Connecticut license plate stops by and asks him a question. He says, ‚Äú Ihappened to notice some milkweed growing down by your pond. Would it be ok if I go get some milk? ‚ÄúThe farmer , perplexed, says to himself, ‚ÄúThis should be amusing ‚Äú. About an hour later the flatlander returns with 2 bottles full of milk. He thanks the farmer and leaves. The farmer scratches his head in bewilderment, but soon forgets about it. 
The next weekend, the farmer is out cutting wood when again the same car pulls in.
The man from Connecticut says, ‚ÄúI noticed when I was getting milk last weekend that there was some honeysuckle growing and I wondered if I could go get some honey?‚Äù The farmer, remembering his amazement from the previous visit, said, ‚ÄúSure, why not?‚Äù About an hour later, the man from Connecticut returned with 2 jars of honey, thanked the farmer, and left. The farmer was quite baffled by this 2nd incident. 
Being busy though, he quickly forgot about it. 
The next weekend, the farmer was just coming onto his porch when once again the same fellow pulled in again. This time he asked the farmer,
Hey ah, I noticed, down near the woods there‚Äôs some pussy willow‚Äôs growing and‚Ä¶ The farmer said, Hold on, I‚Äôm putting my boots on and coming with you!
Yeah, rural living takes a specific personality type. Thats why most people live in population clusters like metros. Humans are social animals and generally crave other humans. People who prefer rural environments prefer less people and have less exposure to other types of people, personalities or cultures. So they invariable get a little narrow minded, a little overly focussed on the local/self. Its just the general lack of variable life experience overall, I think
In my early 20‚Äôs and live in Bennington! I moved here over a year ago from Oregon and have been pretty lonely as well. Feel free to PM me, I‚Äôd love another friend :)
Some people are not meant to live here dunno why my dude but I've never had any of that happen in my life and I love it here. hope you find your spot.
I just moved here in August and while the people I work with are great and I've met some nice people out and about I have noticed how rude and unwelcoming some people can be. I try not to let it bother me but it can feel isolating, especially if you don't have people around to hang out with.
I moved up six years ago and have experienced the opposite but then again, I come from arguably the most rude state in the country (one reason of many for the move) so anything is a step up from that. I think there is a healthy skepticism here of outsiders until locals know your intentions because there are people who come here and want to change things to where they came from. I always am floored by that. If I wanted convenience stores, big box stores, night life and strip malls I would have stayed in Jersey. I left because I could not stand any of that even as a kid. Give me nature and slow living and mom and pop stores and farmstands and town meetings and land for miles. That‚Äôs Vermont to me. Less people is a bonus.
As a 26 almost 27 year old that was born here, lived here my whole life, and has only visited VA Beach, Hampton(NH), Maine, NY, NC & PA. I can confidently say I hate it here. I cannot wait to get out. There is absolutely nothing here, the drugs, stealing and just straight chaos where I live(Swanton) and around where I live, like Saint Albans, I‚Äôm over it. I went to school and was friends with people I now see on the streets strung out, robbing and breaking into peoples car/homes. And don‚Äôt even get me started on Burlington, I don‚Äôt even feel comfortable driving through that city anymore, let alone walking on church street, stabbings, shootings. I got harassed by a dude sitting on the sidewalk with a crack pipe in his hand because I told him I didn‚Äôt smoke when he asked if I had a cigarette he could have. Like you said, this stuff happens everywhere, but all the bad doesn‚Äôt out weigh the good in this state to me. I don‚Äôt ski, I hate snow and the cold and I won‚Äôt leave my house without carrying anymore. 
But I‚Äôm so sorry all that bad stuff has happened to you! Hopefully you get some good luck soon!
I‚Äôve been here 23-24 years. and I‚Äôm not a big fan of Vermont.

(always a flatlander if your grandparents weren‚Äôt born here.)
I agree with some of what you said but there‚Äôs also some stuff I like about Vermont. The isolation and peace is great but it comes at a price. 

It‚Äôs a nice place for this chapter in our lives but we realized about a year in that we don‚Äôt see ourselves here long term. 

The biggest problems are around availability of services and health care. I have to wait 10 months for a basic eye exam or a year for a dental cleaning. I was floored the first time I learned that. But that‚Äôs on us, we didn‚Äôt research carefully. 

Also, there is truly no social life for most towns. Things close at 5-9pm and that‚Äôs basically it. Our social life is the bar and the gym which is fine but also incredibly limiting. Finding younger people our age is a challenge.

Being around our family is important but we‚Äôve realized that it‚Äôs just not enough to keep us here. Good luck, OP.
I'm right outside the arlington stewarts and got a thank you for holding the door.
Pretty much sums up all of New England actually, they all have rough spots and youre in one. Takes some getting used to for some things, I would imagine. I'm born and raised and it's about assimilating or at least don't let it get to you. 


Bennington is one of the higher crime rates per 1,000 people and ranks a "6" with "100" being the safest for scale. 

At least it's not Montpelier. A lot of homeless.
I'm sorry you've had such bad luck. It's not the norm, in my experience. 

Other than the Czech Republic, you don't mention where you hail from. Where did you move to VT from? 

For me, I moved here 40 years ago for two things: to be left the fuck alone, and *to be left the motherfuckingshit alone*. (And all the beauty and nature, etc etc) And in that, I have been pretty darn happy.

But being young and living here I can see being pretty lonely. But there are plenty of bars and open mic nights and whatnot in Bennington, and I'm sure ManchVegas has similar. Have you checked them out?
Thanks everyone for your comments! For those of you who said ‚Äújust leave,‚Äù I‚Äôve decided that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing. My mum is very sick, and I‚Äôm leaving to go take care of her. 

Vermont is not the worst place in the world. I‚Äôve met a number of cool people and my job has enriched me professionally, but it‚Äôs all been too much for me. I‚Äôm out. I‚Äôm happy that you‚Äôve all found a place that you love, but this just ain‚Äôt it for me!
It‚Äôs super expensive to live here for what it has to offer. Used to be a good state to live in, until politics completely took over here and ran it into the ground. If you‚Äôre looking to move somewhere (especially if you‚Äôre younger and looking to start a family) don‚Äôt move here.
It sound like you and Vermont are compatible. I honestly hope you find a good place to settle that you are more comfortable in.

Reading between the lines, I get the impression you are also dealing with the lower income side of things. Living in VT with a low income is particularly difficult right now with the prices of housing, food, transportation, etc.
I'm a bit confused by some of this. You say you live in southern VT but that you experience the most issues in "northern areas" - what does that mean? 

Also it's pretty easy to do a little research and realize that, if fast food is your thing, living in rural vermont is likely to not be for you. Same goes with having to drive 30min to everything - 5 minutes on google maps could tell you this. Local politics too serious? These people actually really care about this place that they call home - it's ok that you don't care for it and don't call it home, but don't hold it against people who are passionate about it. Be happy that there aren't more serious issues to deal with than open sign colors. I don't have a response for all the thefts and whatnot - but it does seem you have been disproportionately impacted by theft which raises some questions. Sucks that your apartment was moldy but that happens everywhere in the world, and it sounds like your landlord took care of it which can sometimes be easier said than done. 

Finally, very, and I mean VERY, few people are moving to Bennington/Sunderland for work. They just aren't. So the infrastructure isn't really built for young newcomers to the working scene. 

I get it, it sucks, you're unhappy, but I think you're blaming the fact that you and Vermont aren't compatible on Vermont. Believe it or not there are plenty of people happily living here and working on improving many things - and the entire state doesn't really owe you anything in terms of changing for you. Again I can appreciate your position, but your angst is misguided and your energy would be better spent finding a way to get to a different place that works better for you.
Start Mountain Biking. Vermont has really good trails and it‚Äôs something fun to do.
I am from Long Island a have a camp just over the boarder from Bennington in NY.  I often go to Bennington for drinks and food. I have found the locals welcoming.  I have even frequented some of the places you‚Äôve mentioned.  If a flat lander can be accepted a guy from Maine surely can.  Kill them with kindness
Damn OP,  this really hit home hard for me. I moved to Vermont several years ago in my early 20s to work in restaurants in Woodstock.

/rant

I was pretty shocked to be treated like a colonizing foreigner while simultaneously reading in the news about labor shortages and how the economy is basically begging for people like me. There wasn't a single restaurant or store that wasn't understaffed or hiring.

I COMPLETELY understand locals being pissed about out of staters buying up property for their second home. Hell, it pissed me off too. 

Mind you, I am in the Woodstock/Quechee area of all places. It was mind boggling that people my age were so smug and standoffish to outsiders. Meanwhile, their parents probably moved there in the 90s so they can golf and open some bullshit antique shop with their Goldman Sachs pensions. But since these crunchy Karens and gatekeeping Gregs were born in the shadows of an exclusive country club and had an 802 phone number they get to be "real Vermonters." Silver spoon ass fake hippies.. smh. 

Anyway, shout out to the working class Vermonters and other foreigners in the trenches. Y'all were real ones. Make sure to smile when you bring them their $24 locally sourced cheeseburger during the dinner rush.

/end rant
This is a rural state, it's normal to drive 20 minutes to a grocery store if you live in a backwoods little town like Arlington.¬†


There no shame in not fitting in, so you should try somewhere else.¬†There is shame in whining and then doing nothing to remedy yourself.


But let me cry big salty tears that your favorite brand of fast-food is far away. One of the things that like about VT is that bland chain-franchises don't quite have a stranglehold on lower-end dining.
Sorry to hear this. I know most people will upvote this because Vermonters want Vermont to not change. So take your upvotes. 

But just fyi your experience sounds pretty odd. Don‚Äôt want to downplay it but to anyone who wants to move to Vermont should do lots of research first. And I mean actually visit the place you want to live for extended period of time. Because Vermont is rural you need to check your specific area and know what you are getting into. Living 2 towns over could be completely different. I am sorry you didn‚Äôt know about 30 minute drive for anything but you should know that before you move. We enjoy that and want it to stay that way. Sorry about the bad stuff that happened but some of the stuff you complain about is why we live here. 

Much love to you and hope things change. Living in southern Vermont is also much different than other places. It all depends on pocket and situation but I hope things get better for you.
Vermont is full of people who aren‚Äôt from Vermont. They probably aren‚Äôt even from New England.
I'm so sorry that all those horrible things happened to you! I hope things get better for you. I was lucky to move away from Bennington, but now I'm so far from stores, as you said. 

What kind of clothes do you need? DM me your size - I can deliver some to you or something!
I‚Äôm sorry for your experience. It is tough in VT. A lot of wannabes pretending that love and acceptance are paramount to any other values‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ but only if you think exactly like they do. There are good people here, though. I hope you find em.
You deserve better! That‚Äôs not your place, those are just not your people, and there are better opportunities in kinder places. It may work for some, but not everywhere is suited for everyone. I‚Äôm so sorry, that sounds like a really shitty year. Onwards and upward my friend, keep moving along ‚ú®
I have friends in VT and most of their local culture is centered around keeping community small and hating on anyone that‚Äôs not from VT. NY, CT, and MA bring up all the money for skiing and hiking and the Vermonters act like they don‚Äôt need the tourists or the tax revenue from outside home ownership, but they desperately do. All while having an aura of being somehow better than you for absolutely no reason at all. It‚Äôs very strange.
Me too, man.

I have had my car stolen, iPhone, professional camera and so so so much more stolen from my car. I also grew up in a mold infested house and it largely impacted my health. Your story is not unique unfortunately. And the awful judgement if you say you grew up in Barre, Rutland, Hardwick, Bennington, Milton or the Old North End or any trailer park really. They automatically think you are trash. Even though there are good neighborhoods in each of those towns, it doesn‚Äôt matter.
Some people just don't like it here and there's nothing wrong with that. I find it very easy to make friends here, but enough people struggle that it's clear not everyone has that experience.


The housing does suck, no arguments there, that's my own biggest complaint with the state. The quality of this state's housing stock is absolutely abysmal.



Sorry you haven't enjoyed yourself, hope you eventually find happiness either here or elsewhere.
Sorry your time in our fair state hasn't been the greatest. Vermont is not for everyone. I was going to be sarcastic and say something witty because sarcasm is our love language here in Vermont, but you have already received your daily dose of that. If I were you, I would actively be looking for somewhere more suited to your lifestyle. Maybe not in New England.
I moved here from Ohio. Definitely feel the "cold and standoffish" thing you feel but I always assumed it was because I was used to mid-western politeness.
VT is a strange state.

First state to abolish slavery and the last to ratify the 19th amendment.   It went into eugenics for awhile and wanted to be independent.   

It has an issue with drug use and crime.  It's only increased and gotten worse since the pandemic.  There is no answer to this so far.  

On the national level, Vt is usually seen as having covered bridges everywhere, the leaves are in perpetual state of changing leaves, there's a covered bridge around every corner, Bernie Sanders is from there, and there's Champ on the discovery channel people know about.  Knowledge seems to end there.  Weirdly enough I have found VTers more friendly on vacation out of state than actually in state.  I guess because of how small the state is and running into others.  

VT was once a republican stronghold and over time due to the Eisenhower administration managed to put in the highway system making Chittenden County  have far more left moving in.  Ironically, the democratic party platform has the same beliefs as the 1956 party platform, giving credence to intellectual claims that the democratic party is actually more of a republican party platform of the 1950s and the Republican Party is far, far right.  

VT seems to have its democratic stronghold which has led to more gentrification and overall numerous people moving out of state from the cities.  It has areas largely impoverished and decaying.  The quality or spirit has declined.   One county caters more to the rich and not to those that have lived here for generations and doesn't do much to help them. The very principles aren't applied to their own state, like making a living wage to be in VT, affordable housing program to an instate and first time buyer.  

 Most can't afford to live here and they move out of state.  Most of the state's character has largely turned more into a state of renting out giant 1800s homes into 5 to 6 apartments with slum lords and people that don't live there.  Overtime, towns themselves, similar to other states in NE, are rich and mostly empty, but that changed once the owner realized that it wasn't that bad to live in the third mansion remotely for some time as opposed to a few days a year.  The prices went up and zero has been done to address it.  That goes with rent and also housing.  

Outside of Chittenden County, we get more into rural areas, where such an such person stayed on a plot of land that was likely stolen by Native Americans and has led lived there for several generations.  They are largely foreclosed in thinking, belief system, and unaware of an outside world think populist MAGA.  Like other states, in the US, one isn't really accepted if they have to move around a lot.  Most don't have much of an open mind.  It isn't necessarily all, but is most, dependent on demographics and location.  

VT might be a microcosm of everything wrong with the US and its issues happen elsewhere.  I'm largely convinced its not fixable at this point.  A lot needs to change.
If you want fast food at a moments notice, move back to the city. It sounds like you moved here with no knowledge of the area and are experiencing buyers' remorse. Vermont is a very particular state with very particular people. Your complaints are in the same vain of moving to Arizona and complaining it's hot and there's too much sand
You're not crazy and you're not alone. I felt the same way before making the decision to leave. Vermont can be exceedingly cruel and asks too much of it's working class. I get the feeling that the only people who think it's paradise have never really lived anywhere else. It sounds like it might be time for you to either substantially change your circumstances here, or to plan to thrive somewhere else. The community here is not interested in change and as the state ages and young professionals and families feel less and less welcome, I am not optimistic that things will get better. And ignore the negative voices on this thread. Less than a year ago I saw this online community mocking a woman who was snowed in with young children and just looking for someone she could pay to help plow her out. The same people who think they are ruggedly independent will desperately expect someone else to solve their problems for them the moment the shoe is on the other foot. They also seem to think driving out young professionals will somehow help their housing crisis rather than just a result in a resource poor community where it is impossible to get any help for anything other than exorbitant prices, just further pricing out those who can barely afford to be here.

Good fortune to you and if you choose to leave, know that you didn't fail. Vermont failed you.
I could say a lot to commiserate with you here as I'm not originally from here but have been here long enough to at least find some kind of personal balance and I'm not far from you so some of what you said I've experienced. I'll refrain from writing a novel though. But yeah, I get what you're saying.

It's even weirder when you've traveled a fair bit and things like people from Manchester treating people from Bennington like that just seems so... Small world.

You've definitely had some bad experiences above and beyond what I've seen: health, crime, etc. Like you said that can happen anywhere. But it's compounded on other actual local issues.
Try a different perspective. Maybe reflective.
Come to NH
‚ÄúFrom Away‚Äù
I‚Äôm from Indiana and Arizona.  Moved up here in 06.   There are ups and downs.  As a guy of color I‚Äôve experienced more positive connections.  The winters here suck tho lol. I do miss Arizona everyday.   I have met good friends here in vt
I live in rural N.H. not far from vt.    It‚Äôs basically the same here.
We moved to close to Brattleboro and moved away. I 100% agree with your comment about people being judgey. Come to Mass, you‚Äôll be much happier. 

You need a tribe in VT and we couldn‚Äôt find one.
Yo try New Hampshire. It‚Äôs awesome here. Look at Laconia/Lakes Region.
Would you consider moving to Williamstown in Mass? It‚Äôs just a little farther south of Bennington. I always thought it had a better vibe
Come to Philly, you‚Äôll be happier.
Toughen up or move to a city.
I mean, its all full of yanks.
I live and work in Bennington. Is it great? No, but then it's hardly a cesspool either. Like most places, it is what you make it to be. Do you live in a Peter Cross apartment by chance? :p



I was born and raised in London, a city with 10x the population of the whole state of VT, and have had no problems at all settling in...even as a queer person with a weird accent. People have been nothing but kind.

  
Anyway, anecdotal evidence is anecdotal, I guess.
I lived there ten years as a teen and was miserable. Nothing to do. Nowhere to go and no way to get there. Sorry you are having a bad time.
Let me just ask you this- have you ever met a Vermonter outside of Vermont? Rarely. They are in a rural area for a reason. You have to earn their trust and respect.
this might be the one rare occasion where you‚Äôd be happier if you were closer to rutland
Hey just wanted to say I hear you and that sucks. I had a really similar experience moving to Maine for a bit a few years ago (minus the car thing.) everyone around me was retired and the few young people I met had just lived such different lives that we could only connect on a superficial level and felt pressure to get along because there were so few of us. I worked really terrible jobs and suffered a ton of health issues, went through horrible living situations and eventually just left. I say this because like Vermont people love Maine for the beauty and peace and it has plenty of that, but sometimes a place isn‚Äôt a good fit and you just have shit luck. My advice is take a deep breath, do some research, find a goal and make a move somewhere. It changed my life and I hope yours improves soon. Sorry you‚Äôre going through this but is gets better.
I live in Vermont and it‚Äôs beautiful but all the problems are swept under the rug and as far as peoples behavior I‚Äôve noticed that no one says excuse me or thank you . I hope you have just had some bad luck and I hope things get better for you I honestly love vt I‚Äôve traveled and have felt the same as you everywhere else even here
Glad to see you‚Äôre not being downvoted. :) I‚Äôve met a few nice ppl in Montpelier‚Ä¶but it‚Äôs HARD‚ÄîI‚Äôve met the nicest folks at the Marshfield general store. Hands down. Lol. I have no idea why this is! I stopped in once to ask where to get a hair cut for my husband and two older men came out from the back to give me the most detailed directions, ever. The young blonde who is the cashier? The sweetest. They bother with the smallest courtesy. There seems to be a really good mix of older and younger kind ppl there. And my husband works in Cabot where everyone he works with are very kind. A lot are much younger. 
From what I gather? They don‚Äôt live in Cabot but around there. I think VT is very different town to town. I‚Äôm still new here as well. But I‚Äôd recommend the area I‚Äôm in. Parkapoolza is every Thursday with music. There‚Äôs lots of music and art stuff going on downtown. Not some huge show type thing but looks like decent bars with outside seating and looking out into streets. Maybe try this area next for a night out?
I'm currently living in Barre, not by choice (rough situation and had friends offer a place to stay), and after working for nearly a year at a "decent" paying job, there's no way I'm affording my own place.

I travel south into the Albany NY area on a regular basis and am pretty well acquainted with towns along the route through family and friends. Family and friends is key. Trying to exist here as someone starting out is nearly impossible without a ton of money or assistance, and if the  assistance doesn't come from within the state, then it has to come from bringing folks with you. 

So you either don't need the help, which implies you're of a different socio-economic class than most of the blue-collar farmer hunter types, or you need the help and end up bringing in outsiders and end up "changing" Vermont. Difficult to feel welcome, but I spent more than 50% of my life in NY so not feeling welcome doesn't bother me right now.

Bennington is a great place to just pass right on through. The welcome center on rt 7 has great bathrooms.
I should have added NH and ME are very very similar: you can be in one town with a great overall friendly and open vibe. Drive twenty minutes south and get your wallet stolen, in a fight, attacked. Etc etc. it sounds crazy but it‚Äôs true. I‚Äôve been all over. And I got robbed more In Portland Maine than in Oakland CA. I dealt with more bold faced racism in big ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù posturing cities. 
Our expectations and experiences can differ wildly to say the least.
Well friend as soon as I saw in the first paragraph that you live in Bennington I can surmise that I don‚Äôt need the res of the post to believe you
I've never been to Vermont, but we moved to the North Shore in Minnesota a few years ago and love it. To be honest we're a couple of wallflowers and a wee bit socially awkward. I grew up in a really bad part of Kansas City but have never felt so at ease as I do here. The crime is low, people people seem pretty happy and seem to.come back after moving elsewhere.¬†


Either way I hope you can find something that can turn things around.¬†
I don't know, you kind of complain like a Vermonter...
 Us New Englanders are not soft and warm we‚Äôre hard on the outside and way colder than our winters. It‚Äôs just how we are, the no saying thank you is pretty on par for up north sadly. The theft is something new since the lawlessness started in 2020 sadly.
Hi! I also recently moved to Bennington and totally get it. I found one thing that helped was frequenting one local spot a lot (even just to hang out) helps as people stare at you less and the waitstaff get to know you (I did Sunny Side and the Local). There‚Äôs a few walks around that happen through Bennington museum which may be good for getting to know people.
Vermont sucks
I worked in Bennington for over seven years and never once felt welcomed or accepted by the community. They have  really insular us vs. them mentality that I can‚Äôt get behind.
I moved to Vermont back in 2018, and moved out 6 months later.

The people around Bellows Falls are just nasty.  And I hate to say it, but when there is only one or two minority families in an area, that‚Äôs a huge red flag.

On a side note, there were more Black Lives Matter posters in Vermont than in Boston üòÇ
20 something looking to move to Vermont? If you want any semblance of urban amenities move to Burlington or close by. If you like outdoor recreation (biking, hiking, skiing), move to the Waterbury area. There's a little bit of a younger vibe in the Upper Valley, though it skews towards health care professionals and those connected to Dartmouth. Pretty much EVERYWHERE else is going to be a struggle; rural, expensive, boring, poverty stricken, drug problems, older demographics, second home owners, insular; take your pick or combination.
Vermont is horrible
I love to look at Vermont, it looks good on paper. I have isolated myself because people are rude and inconsiderate and I don't like people. But I think that is just what society is now. Everything just seems unreal.
This post just sent my husband and I into a serious conversation about what we‚Äôre doing here.  Have lots of acreage and he works outside everyday.  He loves it and so does every tourist who walks along our road.  When we bought the place 11 years ago, people were not friendly AT ALL.  A neighbor used to yell at my husband for coming up here and buying the land and raising their taxes. Apparently they don‚Äôt understand that my increased property taxes are paying for their shack. We live here full time and the only friends we‚Äôve made moved here from out of state.  The 5 most famous words are ‚ÄúI‚Äôm originally from New Jersey‚Äù.  I miss so many things from my ‚Äòother life‚Äô.  Everything I have is from Amazon.  I‚Äôm not looking for fast food. 

This place will go in trust for my 3 children to figure out.  In the meantime, I‚Äôll keep searching for my niche.  I‚Äôm really open to new ideas but currently I have a sour taste in my mouth from where I landed.
That's because that's not really vermonters thise down there are more like mass holes. Come up to the real vermont.
I love Vermont and absolutely hate Bennington with a passion. It‚Äôs a shit hole and I used to live in Manchester, NH, Bridgeport, CT, and Woonsocket, RI‚Ä¶so I know shit holes.
....It's Vermont!
People in Vermont are 100% ruder than people in New Hampshire or Maine. I have no idea why
You have to be a townie to live there
Nobody cares what Manchester thinks and Bennington is kind of a shit hole. 

Sorry it didn't work out for you

I wouldn't wanna be anywhere else in the US but people suck everywhere. Xenophobia is real up here and people can smell bullshit a mile away.
Assuming OP works for Orvis?
Im sorry all that happened to you, but I understand what you are feeling. I came to VT from NYC when I was 15 yrs old let me tell you CULTURE SHOCK!!!  I have gone back and fourth on weekends because there was nothing to do, I couldn‚Äôt make friends because one of the mothers told her kids to stay away from me because I came from the city and I was bad news!!

I couldn‚Äôt wait to get out and when I finally did and moved back to NYC it was the happiest day of my life. 

I never ever called myself a Vermonter, I was at that time and will be forever a New Yorker!!
Moved to Bennington a little over a year ago and have had the polar opposite experience here.  Everyone I've met have been super friendly to me.  Sorry you're having this bad of a time.
I was born and raised in Chicago and never had been broken into and robbed until I moved to Vermont..
I moved to a small town near St Johnsbury back in 03.  Found the locals extremely unfriendly and the flat lander resentment was clear.  (I came from Long Island, NY).  Sold cars and that was fun and made a lot of friends.  Met my second wife there and went back to NY after three years.  (With her) Got easy after a while but the first few months were lonely.  VT is a beautiful spot but it suffers the same low level drug fueled crime and shittiness as every other place in the US.  Loneliness can strike anywhere.  Reach out to old friends to get you through.
...move to Burlington
If chains like Wendy‚Äôs and Walmart are important to you, maybe you are more cut out for someplace like Detroit. On the other hand, if going to local businesses with tastefully-designed signs and talking with your friends about local updates is your vibe, that‚Äôs southwestern Vermont.

Rudeness is a Bennington thing‚Äîit‚Äôs an increasingly poor town that gets left behind more and more every year. If I lived there, I‚Äôd probably be bitter too. I don‚Äôt know anyone who would recommend that someone move there.
I was born in Bennington and lived in Arlington and Wilmington. Vermont is a very insular, xenophobic place. They even side-eye people who leave and comeback. There‚Äôs also the issue of so many dying little towns that can‚Äôt admit they‚Äôre in a death spiral. Arlington being one.
I lived there over 7 years.  He is describing the situation in Vermont fairly honestly.  It is also extremely expensive.  Housing can be hard to find outside of Burlington or Waterbury.
From north shore Boston, lived in Denver metro/Colorado most of my 20‚Äôs, then back to MA for a few and at 30 I took a position in southern VT and moved. Living in Bratt and working in Chester, engage in recreation all over southern and central VT.

I disagree. Sorry to hear you‚Äôve struggled however. Hope it turns around.
I don‚Äôt blame you, my family moved out 2 years ago and haven‚Äôt looked back since, state sucks ass
Dude I'm from VT and I love my friends and family but I barely even want to be here. The moldy apartments I can afford suck. The food is so expensive. There's drugs everywhere. The flooding seem be getting worse. IDK dude. I wish I could leave. Unless you're insanely wealthy you can't live here
Yea I left for Boston and Denver in my 20s, can‚Äôt wait to move back soon in my mid 30s! Sounds like you need a busier place with newer apartments, Colorado is cool
Vermont is not for everyone, even living in or near chittenden county.  In my experience, folks living in the southern part of the state don't hold true to what a "Vermont Lifestyle" is.   Please don't blame Vermont for other folks having a bad attitude, i can assure you that is not normal.  I would suggest that if you feel this uncomfortable here, seeking an alternative place to live/work would be the best idea.   

As a side note, i notice you didn't mention anything about your ethnic group, which unfortunately does have a lot to do with how certain people treat you.  You mentioned the Czech Republic, so i'm going to assume you have an accent, and don't really look like the folks around here.   Don't take that heart, there is still quite a bit of xenophobia around here, much to my dismay.  Chin up, and find your place, i know you can.  Good luck!
I loved Vermont but it didn‚Äôt love me back (lived in Burlington)
You get an upvote from me. I grew up here and it used to be so much better here‚Ä¶  less crime. It is a beautiful state as far as rolling hillsides and old wooden bridges go. I used to think people here were actually nice too (I‚Äôd always get a wave or two from people walking by on the road.) But I too have noticed a decline in curtesy. People who are here now are not nice. I also had to deal with mold illness from the house I was living in, so I can relate to that, as well. I connect the decline of Vermont to the local Politics. We let anyone and everyone into this state now. A friend of mine who grew up in the hood and moved here to escape it, said it is looking just like the hood. Graffiti everywhere, escalating crimes, etc. Our Socialist Politicians also say ‚ÄúTax the rich!‚Äù‚Ä¶ but instead they tax the common man, and farmers, etc. People are getting sick of it. This state has declined and I agree, until it changes this state is going to sink alongside those who supposedly ‚Äúlead it‚Äù.
Relatable. Came here for work and not flourishing also in my mid/late 20s.
VT is very politically polarized. You have the native liberal conservatives (doesn‚Äôt fit in modern politics), and the super progressive trust fund flatlanders that have moved in. It sounds like you are a good kid, holding doors open and such, might even fit in with the former.some of us have been here since the 1500‚Äôs and dont like change. Others just got here and want to make it like where they came from. It can be hostile, and rightfully so. Pick your sides and choose your battles wisely.
I was born and raised in Vermont (WRJ area), but moved to NH 5 years ago and would highly recommend NH over Vermont for several reasons.  

1st - NH prosecutes criminals and seems to have much less break ins and theft because of it.  NH also seems to be able to retain experienced police officers that care about the towns they serve and the people in them - many towns in Vermont have reduced police numbers and prosecutors seem to have a catch and release policy for criminals.

2nd - No state income tax in NH is like having a ~6% pay bump over Vermont.

3rd - More medium to large size towns with grocery and box stores make it more convenient than most of Vermont.

4th - Better infrastructure (less road washouts/closures) and more reliable snow clearing and road treatment in the winter.

It makes me sad the way Vermont has gone downhill over the last 5-10 years and I will always have love for the state.  Most of my (very large) family still lives in Vermont and I visit often...
I live in New Hampshire. I met a man from an old Vermont family (Colonial settlers)  who lives in the North East Kingdom area of Vermont. He hates Vermont now too because of all the outsiders who moved in, many from New York, and changed the culture of the State.
"If you‚Äôre in your 20s/30s and you‚Äôre thinking of moving to VT by yourself for work or something, just don‚Äôt."

We found common ground. Please do what you can to spread the word as wide as possible. Do Not Come Here.
Vermont has bad areas like any other state.  Please don‚Äôt generalize the state because of one particular experience that sounds like being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Vermont is the most beautiful state I have ever lived, that being said the price for that are long winters, solitude, and hard work, did I mention solitude.  These are also what you have to embrace to enjoy life here.  You can be happy or unhappy anywhere, it‚Äôs not always about the place, manifest destiny.  Truly hope things get better.
Hey thanks for holding the door.  Fell better now.  Btw I am a Mainer and we hate people.  VT peeps are the best.
Wow. Thank you. üôè THIS ^^ has been our exact experience living in the Brattleboro area now for well over 10 years. Don‚Äôt even ask me why we are still here‚Ä¶ Only to say that when you have children it‚Äôs much harder to move out of state ‚Ä¶I find that the locals take themselves way too seriously ‚Äî and take it upon themselves to educate newcomers on how to parent, own a dog, own a home, etc., regardless of how seasoned you might be. 
I never thought that I could miss Connecticut! But I do. And Vermonters say CT natives are **unfriendly**!?! Hah.
Probably should pin this to the top of the subreddit.
I moved to Vermont 3 years ago. I don‚Äôt like it. During those three years I haven‚Äôt really made any friends. I did learn how to ski and fly fish, so I guess there‚Äôs that. 

My wife and kids don‚Äôt want to leave which is sad as I now need to return to the office so I‚Äôm dragging them back at the end of the school year.
Sounds like you‚Äôre just having a string of bad luck, and instead of considering things to be grateful for, you‚Äôre putting bad energy out. Consider this, you do have a landlord who fixed things. You do have a good job so you can deal with issues. People are probably picking up on your energy that you do hate it here so they avoid you at all costs. I think if you leave you‚Äôll find your problems were not geographical at all. And just some advice, which is good advice no matter where you live. Don‚Äôt leave things in your car. Because it must really suck to be the person who needs clothes so bad they need to commit a felony
Shit. This sounds like the peak of shitty experiences.  I‚Äôm not saying this for any reason except to empathize with you.  Sorry this hasn‚Äôt worked out.
I‚Äôm so sorry this is happening to you!! I agree there‚Äôs way too many judgy people here, and being a type of different makes people treat you like shit. I hope you receive help somehow and the friends you have keep you supported. Keep your head up you got this (my apartment also has mold in it so I feel you)
Bennington has a very high crime rate. 

Passing through there years ago I got a vibe suggesting it was an even more isolating place to live than where I lived at the time. I didn‚Äôt last  long living up there. Never even met my neighbors
I moved to the NEK and it‚Äôs been great. Perhaps explore other areas of the state? I‚Äôve been here 5 months and the most consistent feedback I hear from locals is stay away from south/south central Vermont üòÖ
You don't get all of that in the greater Burlington area.  The cost of living is higher, but I think you would have a much better experience.
Grew up in Bennington, and yeah, this tracks lol
Many of the towns in Chittenden County are great places. I lived and raised a family in Richmond, and now I have a daughter who loves Hinesburg. Great schools there. 

Although,  it is stupid expensive to live there, rents are high, real estate is basically out of reach for 1st time buyers. Avg home is $380k, and that gets you just above a trailer for a home, maybe 2 bdrm, 1 bath.
I lived in somewhat sketchy parts of New York City for over 20 years and was never once a victim of crime. Vermont is statistically about the safest place you can live, so to hear someone had their car broken into not once but twice is...odd to put it mildly. Not saying it didn't happen, just that it's a freak occurance that's not representative of the state. I'm sorry to hear you've had a bad time hear and hope things improve. It's far from perfect but as someone who has lived in many parts of the nation (including the deep South) I'd take Vermont's quirks any day of the week.
I‚Äôm from NH. Traveled to VT over years and nearly every time I am left shaking my head wondering WTF????! It is strangest place. Weird. Creepy. Try to avoid going there at nearly any cost. I have driven to Boston to go to THE Somerville Home Depot rather than cross the Connecticut river and wander into VT.
I live down the road from Bennington. Your description is right on. I live between Bennington and Pittsfield, so for Home Depot and some other stuff we switch off which one we go to. Bennington is uncomfortable. Shirley Jackson wrote The Lottery and some of her other work while living there, and I don‚Äôt think much has changed.
If youre ever down in the upper valley ill take ya out for some drinks. Show ya some friendly faces around to help offset the negativity
Sorry that your having a bad experience and hope it does get better truly, only issue I find with ur post is ur line about caring about local politics. Those are in fact the politics you should care about THE MOST; ur example sure is what ever its just a sign color after all.
I feel you on the Ramunto‚Äôs comment lol. I stayed in Bennington for a weekend this March, and when I walked in to pick up the pizza I ordered, the entire bar, full of people, turned around and stared at me as I walked to the counter. It was like they could smell I wasn‚Äôt from there.
I‚Äôm so sorry. Grew up in vt and this makes me sad.
Sorry for your troubles man.  Get out of Bennington for one.  Never felt there was much going on there.   But also, this is a low population state‚Ä¶makes social options for newcomers minimal.  But most important thing I wanted to ask‚Ä¶is Ramuntos in Bennington going down hill?  I feel like it used to be really good‚Ä¶..noticed the crust started getting overly thin recently‚Ä¶.cheese/crust ratio is way off, and slice is getting floppy/soggy.  Wasn‚Äôt always like that.
This place is crazy I am down in southern Vermont and we had a foreign exchange student at my school some years back. I was nice to him like I am to everyone I meet. Am he asked me where I was born. When I told him here in Vermont he thought I was joking. 

Seems people in the school and area weren‚Äôt the nicest to him and he didn‚Äôt think someone as nice as me could be born here. 

I‚Äôm sorry so much has been happening to you. I wish people could be nicer. I know if I saw you I would feel special just getting to see someone so nice out in the real world. Please don‚Äôt let the mean people drag you down to their level and know I would be happy to help how ever I could. With a home made batch of cookies to brighten your day or some fruits from my garden to help you smile.
Sorry you are going through this , Vermont has the most Curmudgeon people in New England,  post your job experience with your story and you will probably get a few offers outside of Vermont
I left Vermont about 15 years ago. Best decision of my life. It‚Äôs a beautiful place but it was not the right place for me. I still have family there so I visit occasionally. My life has improved in so many ways since I left.

Perhaps you need a change of scenery too.
I moved to Vermont for a job (Poultney) about a year ago and really like it.  Thankfully it was super easy for me to meet a lot of new people
Who were into the same outdoors stuff as me.  Im in my mid 30s tho when I was 25 I stil lived in NYC.
Need more posts like this in the sub to deter transplants
People in Vermont hate outsiders. That‚Äôs why I left moved over to Utah better skiing anyways.
I lived there for around 5 years, and I agree.  Getting involved with the local community is hard.  You almost have to get started in a town that is mostly people who didn't grow up there.  I lived in both Plainfield and Cabot, and the people were pretty nice.  The standoffish thing is definitely just a New England attitude, people are weird up there.  There's also very high taxes that don't pay for the right things.  It's not the worst place to live, but it's far from this idealic fairy tale land that so many people think it is.  I moved back to York County, Pennsylvania, in late 2023, and I absolutely love it here! ü§ò
Vermont is a joke. State has turned into California
Sorry about your experience. I lived nearby in Granville NY about 20 minutes to Dorset VT I loved it there
Thats so interesting. I have spent a lot of time in the Czech Republic and found people there to be incredibly kind, and friendly and willing to go out of their way for you.


Vermonters I find pretty neutral I guess but New Englanders in general can be a bit funky with non locals though that is what Vermont seems to be filled with.
Oddly I am sitting in my den in shaftsbury.  I must say this is the closest Ive gotten to any feedback on vermont.  I grew up In western mass and moved to nyc in 1994. Got the hell Out of dodge just over a year ago.  Nyc lost its luster for me big time.  Full disclosure I have a house here and managed to reconnect with a few highs school friends and actually met my wife in becket mass.  I worked in the financial industry for over twenty years and it was a shitshow of ego, backstabbing and judgment.  I figured i could make it work but outside of bucolic scenery vermont has mostly three classes; lifelong vermont folks who are plugged into many legacy jobs, contractors etc.  of labor work who make good money, the aristocrat class who are every bit an asshole and any nyc entitled wealthy person, and the severely poor.  Finding work is very difficult as there isnt much industry ‚Äúby design‚Äù as far as i am concerned.  I am 53 working retail making not enough money to
Survive.  I have had to resort working  seven days a week in order to
Make do.   I feel
Your pain and i am sorry.  If vermont were a living organism, the asshole
Would be bennington.  Total shit show.  Text me Back if you want to Chat.
Vermont gives the US a bad name. Literally anywhere else in New England will seem like paradise compared to that dump. Bennington is a shining star of the incest capital of the world.
Wow I actually heard bad things about bennington, or someone just said a negative comment about the place, but I didn't know much about the area at the time, so I didn't know whether to believe it or not. I will say this, in regards to culture, welcome to new england. Some people, especially from rural areas may not have the posh manners we might have or they weren't ever taught them. They actually might have some that city folks DON'T HAVE. People in New England, especially Vermont, are miserable! BUT the catch is, i.e., my neighbor and I may act like this, but if I needed something, they would help! And likewise. I've noticed that people have less etiquette these days, less people saying thank you for small things like holding the door. And welcome to the New England, and the US where people care more about the color of a sign that anything else. People in manchester may have nothing else to care about than that. Want good food I suggest you make your own. I work with guys who refuse to buy meat or chicken from the store! The fastest food I know and like to eat is deer, not any grocery store food. (And i havent hunted yet). Wendy's is garbage! Another point about new england, is that Vermonters, Mainers. Hampshirites, CT people, Rhode Islanders, all act like A holes. Maybe some more or less.And people in northern communities think it's just a flatlander ting.  And there's def a lot of towns, or town bars, where they haven't seen a new face before lol. Back to manners, being looked at might be better than totally being ignored. People are curious/nosy in meeeew england.
People here are miserable and the schools are horrible!
I‚Äôm so sorry this is happening to you. It sounds like something is telling you to leave that place/area. Sometimes it just isn‚Äôt a good fit or timing and that‚Äôs ok, now you know and can move on.
The liberals have destroyed Vermont & New Hampshire is getting just as bad, move south, that‚Äôs what we did, people are much friendlier
You should come to Texas  !
I get it! I've lived here 30 years and have no friends that actually stayed in Vermont. I will say the younger generation are much more pleasant to deal with.
That was me. I left 4 months ago and I‚Äôm a lot happier. 

I‚Äôm not sorry to say that Vermont is trashy. Too expensive. Taxes won‚Äôt stop going up. Social programs out the yingyang keeping poor people living off your money. Schools are terrible. Parents don‚Äôt raise their kids with any class. Dump piss and shit into lake Champlain for fun, it seems. Grey weather. Hardly any snow anymore.
Yea bro, I was born and raised here and left for the same reason. It's a bad mix of isolationist backwoods hillbilly yokels, wealthy liberals, and impoverished drug addicts. It's cold, isolated, and out of touch on every level. And it's expensive. Vermlnt is an absolute joke and a lie, Rutland in particular. Never again.
Glad you posted. It's a visually stunning place but roaming around Brattleboro in past years the street scene is creepy---that said, pre internet, growing up in New England, most towns had little to do---kids and adults--people drank too much, now it's drugging too much. I agree with another poster below--for those that love hiking, green living, finding artists and some kind locals--they're out there--it's a great place. But between Brattleboro to Burlington, it's a real life style choice. That said I've met many people that flee Tristate New York, Hawaii, California, Miami for a batch of reasons that don't sound that different.
Looks like we got a flat-lander over here.

Just kidding. All of that sounds so terrible. I‚Äôm from NH and have always gotten some weird vibes from certain parts of VT.
I have family right on the mass/NH/VT border.  I notice the judgy mentality people have.   It‚Äôs a beautiful area,  but kind of strange. 
I think things feel more normal more on the Mass side.
Also in central CT and agree.
I wouldn't give up on VT as a whole just yet. Every corner of the state has its own particular vibe. It can be hard at first to meet and get to know people but once you find community it's gold. VT does certainly hold true to a lot of the things folks say about it but in a less exaggerated way. We do generally really love to be outside in any season/weather in any sort of way. You have to get outside to make it through the winters (if not the cold in our warming climate, then the darkness) but honestly it's so beautiful in all the other seasons that you simply spend a lot of time out of doors. We have our challenges like anywhere else and some that are all our own. It is a small state, and this has both benefits and drawbacks. 

As far as observing townspeople spending two hours arguing over the look of business signs, there are indeed folks who seem to have an awful lot of free time to dedicate to such causes, but at the same time it is crucial to care because if you don't, then who will? People debate the little things because they also dialogue and collaborate over the big things. That is how the work of living gets done in a place like this. 

But I'm from the northeast to begin with (Northern NY) and VT truly feels like home, so I am a bit biased.
Then move?
Time to head over to NH. Nothing but friendly folks over there last time I visited.
It‚Äôs only good if you‚Äôre a 50 year old hipster liberal. Or you live off grid
Vermont is no longer the Vermont I grew up with.  Yeah locals have always been cheeky but the elitist public ordinance allegiance which professes inclusion while simultaneously ostracizing locals with less volatile opinions is the unfortunate reality of VT.  Not sure how it became the woke capital of the US, VT used to be a place where everyone‚Äôs love of farming, forests and community were more important than being ‚Äúpolitically correct‚Äù.  

The whole situation sucks, VT is just the canary in the coal mine of rural gentrification.
"I live in Bennington". Ok read enough haha. Of course youre having a bad time
I lived in Claremont, NH (stones throw away from Vermont) and it was very much like this. Tons of crime, TONS of drugs, nothing was close, the people were awful and just sooo racist. I‚Äôve been in northern Rhode Island for almost 10 years now and I don‚Äôt see myself leaving.
Montana is the nicest place I've ever been..... Minnesota as well
I‚Äôve read most of the comments and I could go either way on this.  Vt is tough.  I‚Äôve met the best people in my life skiing in VT.  As someone who lived in vt 50% of the time for 11 years and now full time for 3 years, I don‚Äôt know many people outside of VT though we meet people wherever we go to festivals etc.  Even growing up and living in CT we never spent enough time in CT so all the people I know in CT I met in VT.  lol.  In VT we have a core group of transplants in our resort community who are like family. Some are locals, many are weekenders, and some are people my husband has met working and going to school in VT.  I have cousins who are natives. We spend time on the cape in the summer.  The thing is that in Connecticut and Massachusetts no one cares where you are from when they meet you.  You don‚Äôt have to defend why you are there.  But in everyday life meeting new people in VT who are locals or natives there is always an undercurrent of ‚Äúwhy are you here?‚Äù.  It‚Äôs gotten significantly worse Every year for the past 10-15 years. Ever since Covid it‚Äôs really bad.  It‚Äôs hard. It‚Äôs such a beautiful place and I love it when I am at a big house party or pot luck or when I‚Äôm at the mountain and I run into any one of the hundreds of friends I have there. That‚Äôs when I feel like it‚Äôs my place and there is nowhere I would rather be.  But it‚Äôs draining the rest of the time.  Even well meaning nice people who are in the community make me feel defensive about belonging sometimes.  It‚Äôs sometimes subtle and other times it‚Äôs not.  My car had CT plates for a long time even though I lived in VT because we were back and forth and had a house in CT.  It was like wearing a flatlander tatoo on my forehead. I was going to the hair dresser who I go to every 12 weeks and the woman leaving ahead of me made a nasty comment to my hairdresser when she was leaving.  In particular I feel it in the grange getting community dinners, at the Nearby grocery store and general store.  But living in an area where 70-80% of the houses are second homes creates a feeling of being invaded by tourists too.  So I always feel like I need to drop a hint I‚Äôm local.  Like when I pay with my debit card I‚Äôm wanting to fumble with my license so they see it says VT.  It‚Äôs just mentally draining to feel you have to defend your right to exist all the time.  Mostly people are nice but‚Ä¶they don‚Äôt really want anyone new to be here even though in my head I‚Äôm not new.  In CT or MA no one would act like that.
Sorry to hear that. It sucks to hear people moving here for actual Vermont jobs are not doing well.¬†


That said, Vermont fucking sucks now. Used to be OK, pre-covid, but it's been loved to death and all the things that made Vermont cool are gone.
Heading to northern VT on Sunday, looking forward to getting a burger in jeffersonville
I mean.... Bennington blows, like, bad.  Erm, but yeah, VT sucks!  Don't come here!
So sorry to hear this. What do you do down there that caused you to move to Vermont ? Sounds like you really like areas with more things happening and hopefully you find a place that works for your needs . VT is highly indigenous and multi generational along with being rural.
I think you will find that most rural places in the US aren‚Äôt terribly welcoming for outsiders. 

And having all of your stuff in your car is an invitation for thieves. 

Most of your complaints seem to be related to normal things that happen when you live somewhere rural in the US, not specific to VT.
Sir, this is not a Wendy's.
Bennington is Trump country, so of course everyone was an asshole. It isn't representative of the entire state, though.
So stop whining ,‚Ä¶ and MOVE OUT
I moved to Bennington two years ago. I‚Äôm extremely tattooed, yet no one looks at me weird or bothers me. The town isn‚Äôt bad at all. Vermont is boring as hell but there is plenty to do within driving distance. Ramunto‚Äôs Bennington is a shitty local drinking spot for college students, if you felt judged there idk where on earth you would feel comfortable. Tbh you sound like a cry babyüòÇ
Guy talks about a small portion of the state as if it‚Äôs the whole state. Why don‚Äôt you just say Bennington sucks ?
Interesting that the comments with the most traction didn't even remotely address any of his concerns.
Massachusetts people especially will want to avoid living in Vermont. We drive too slow and know how to merge. Totally annoying!
Haha! You should try Brattleboro....
It's hard enough trying to afford living here. Everything else is just bonus. I've lived here less than a year and already want out lol
VT sucks if you are poor and it is a Utopia if you are rich enough to enjoy buying expensive food, wine, and activities like skiing or sailing. ALTERNATIVELY, if you are poor but genuinely live for the backpacker/dirtbag mountain lifestyle, you will be OK. You run into problems if you move to Vermont with less than $100,000 annual income expecting a normal suburban American lifestyle. That's not really a thing here. It's rich stuff for the rich OR dirtbag hiker/farmer stuff for either poor or rich who understand and actually like that stuff, OR hell for anyone else. (Was a poor backcountry caretaker with Green Mtn Club along the Long Trail and loved every minute of it. 10/10 recommend, if you know how to backpack.)
Yeah, I live in Vt, I hate it too, looking to move to Austin possibly. There‚Äôs so little joy here. There‚Äôs so many financial problems and poverty that‚Äôs severely spiked in the last few years. The housing costs are unreal for apartments. Food costs are through the roof. Taxes are some of the highest in the country. There‚Äôs lots of open jobs because people can‚Äôt afford to live here. As soon as you said health decline I knew it was mild before you said it. You gotta move somewhere hot and dry to let your body heal.
Bro, that‚Äôs New England, sorry
Lived there for 28 and constantly called a flatlander even though I had more mountains where I grew up than Vermont has. Moved out in 2016 to NC and never looked back
Ageee with everything you said. We moved to NH, 6 miles from Brattleboro. The people have been very unfriendly. We have made no meaningful relationships, and our kids have had a hard time, too.
As a 20 something I lived alone in VT for a while. I thought I could live the whole Thoreau-ian existence out in the woods in a house I rented. 6 months in, I was lonely and miserable. Definitely not for everybody. People were friendly and helpful enough, but like a lot of New England, the default mode is do your thing. Very little social life (I didn‚Äôt like going to bars) and mud season sucked.
I just spent time in Bennington for my job. There is a huge drug problem in Bennington. Its also ‚Äúin the sticks‚Äù, so you have to drive a distance for just about everything. Alot of the hotels are full of homeless people. Im not sure what you do for a living but maybe try Burlington? Or NH?
Vermont does sorta suck. There's more talk about it being wonderful and people being nice then in reality.
I moved here from NY. Raised my son here. Have tons of friends and love it! Yes things are far apart but surrounded by beautiful scenery and good people!
I loved Vermont... Until I didnt. It was an awful experience eventually. I have never experienced the racism that I did in VT.
My experience has been similar: people in VT are aloof, cold, blatantly rude. I grew up in NH, with roots in CT/NY, and it's the same weirdness in NH.  I got the hell out of NH as soon as I could, but with 3 family members in VT, I've spent a lot of time there over the last 20 years. It's fucking weird, and I would NEVER live in either place. It's really pretty, I'll give it that.
This is like the umpteenth time I've seen someone bitching about Bennington area, and a lot of the properties I've seen, even for sale there, have been shit holes.

Should we start making warning signs in the "New to Vermont" reddit that says "don't move to Bennington"?
Bennington is not VT. It is somewhere between Kentucky and West Virginia. I prefer to think of that part of VT as West Benningtucky.
Yeah, dating up here sucks for everyone. Small selection and there's a lot of generational misogyny and sexual/physical abuse that isn't talked about enough.
What do you think the best New England state would be for those in their thirties putting down roots?
Almost 40 and trying to continue my career and regrow roots in the biggest city in Vermont and it's been near impossible.
It had been a couple years since we'd been to Bennington, maybe 5 (?). It's really on hard times these days. Sad because it was a funky, fun place with a nice vibe to it.
Had to scroll too far for this. Sounds like you've had a rough go, OP. I hope things improve for you and that you find community if you decide to stick around.

I agree that it seems hard to start from scratch in a lot of VT towns. There's more opportunity in the bigger areas but COL goes up to match.
Vermont sucks, tell your friends!
Came here to confirm Vermonters are wanna be hippies who actually try to gate keep stuff you can actually find all over the country when they think they are the only ones to have it.
too late, the masses have settled.
where's darryl?
No worries. Most people can‚Äôt afford Vermont.
Yeah, he forgot to mention that we have snakes everywhere here! It‚Äôs awful, definitely don‚Äôt move here!¬†
I mean you‚Äôre joking bc the influx of people but it‚Äôs really not that great. The landscape is pretty I‚Äôll give it that, but I found the towns to be less charming than most in New Hampshire or upstate NY. Was truly surprised by the amount of graffiti and homelessness in Burlington. Montpelier was nice and of course Stowe and Lake Champlain are cool, but not much else. Incredibly mid. I‚Äôd give it an honest 6/10. Seems the more French someone was, the bigger of an asshole they tended to be, but it could be a smaller sample.
I second this. Stay where you are üòÜ
PS - the way I personally made friendly acquaintances and got "in" with the locals, was to go to triva night every Monday at a local bar/restaurant.  I feel like I'm at least tolerated by the locals because of it.  They definitely place me above the tourists and part-timers anyway.  Why don't you try something like that?  Doesn't have to be a bar if that's not your thing, but try involving yourself in the community in some way.  And don't show up with animosity towards locals in your heart.  They can sense it.
That's cause everyone is cousins and you're not related. If you had kids in school you would see how many kids are cousins.
I was kind of desperate for work and an opportunity popped up in VT. I was born in Maine so I thought I understood what ‚Äúrural‚Äù meant, but then when I got to VT I was hit with culture shock. 

I am very involved! My job requires me to be in the community a fair amount, and I do enjoy many of the people I‚Äôve met
lol, nah, Vermonters are pretentious and cold.
Rutland entered the chat‚Ä¶
Why does it seem that all Vermont cities and large towns suck?
This is the correct answer!
[deleted]
I think you have no idea about what happens right under your nose. Have you ever heard the saying give them something small to quibble over so they don‚Äôt see the something big that is really happening?
Well, a number of years ago the Barton (NEK) town council featured fistfights. Idiot old men. FIGHTING with each other. I am not making this up.
ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
100% definitely
We aren't standoffish, we just aren't fake nice.
As a Mainer I concur that we tend to be pretty cautious of people "from away" moving in for better or worse it seems to be a New England thing.
Bennington also had a Wendy's in the early 2000's...and nobody went there.
Having been born, raised and lived here for 48 years I agree with OP 100%.  Bennington hates businesses unless you're friends with the good ole boys.
Faces look ugly, when you're alone...
When you're straaaaaaange
Haha. But wait, dooryard???
This post wins most compassionate award ü•á¬†
Get out! Seriously. Get out now. You still have time.
Lots of judgemental hicks in towns like these. If you aren't a white truck driving hill person it's shite living in these areas given my experience.
It's funny because someone crashed into my car and totaled it back in 2014, but insurance was a mess, my advisor was a piece of shit, and the car didn't get totaled, just fixed twice.

Shoutout for JAS auto as well, the shittiest body shop in the state, go out of business as soon as possible.
I moved here in late March. My husband got a great job opportunity. People have been very kind to us but I did have two new friends tell me that they're letting everyone know we're good people and putting a good word out for us. So it IS cliquey and hard to penetrate through. I've had other transplants tell me it is much easier when you involve yourself in community events and clubs.
See a healthy attitude its not for everyone but everyone should try things out and see what works for them best of luck to you :)
I‚Äôve lived all over the place. I was born in Maine originally, but was living in Rochester, NY before I moved to VT.

I‚Äôm leaving VT at the end of the month
You made the right choice. Hopefully your mom gets better. It's not you, this place sucks.
This. Seriously. I would say there's more going on than just politics (covid gentrification is a big driver of costs) but moving here now unless you are rich is just insane.
I actually work a professional job and make decent money
You are right, and this will be the death of Vermont.¬†


"what if an entire state was only affordable on a remote salary?"¬†
VT about to find out.
I moved here in my early 20s because I am trans and this was a close by state that has a lot of better protections for trans people. My experience has been the exact opposite of OP ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I find people here to be exceptionally kind and way more helpful than where I used to live. Like even employees at any given chain I find are just actually helpful and really kind. This was not my experience growing up in CNY haha which was much more rural and Republican. I heavily prefer being in a heavily blue area. I might not be here permanently but it's definitely not a bad place to be
‚ÄúBe happy‚Ä¶‚Äù is what you suggest to someone having a rough time, huh? Thank god I‚Äôve met nth generation Vermonters who are much more validating than you, Jesus Christ‚Ä¶
I moved to Vermont for work. I can‚Äôt just up and leave. My health insurance is tied to my job, all my doctors are here, and my livelihood comes from having a job. I‚Äôm sick now because of the mold, so moving elsewhere is risky.

Im sure there are plenty of people doing well living in VT, and I‚Äôve met people who love it here, but I‚Äôm not one of them. I moved here for a job out of desperation and unfortunately now I feel stuck
Lots of truth here.
I hate the corporate takeover of VT right now. If it's not maplefields, Irving or dollar general, then it's something worst
What we need to do is utilize tax money to put an unprofitable Wendy's in every town.
New Jersey is not in New England, no.
Omg thank you so much that so nice
Once you make friends with your neighbors you'll experience a kindness you havn't known before.  Don't come here expecting what you know, because that is why most folks fail.
On the other hand "Midwest politeness" is kinda off putting to people from the NE it can be a bit of a culture shock for peopleto talk to you lol. and is REALLY off putting to my partner that is from western Europe lol.
Lived in Vt. for 13 years, moved away for\~10 years then returned and lived here for another 17 years. Finally realized that VT. isn't for me and moved for good. Unless you are 40th generation and your pet dog has ancestry registered for 30 generations within the State, you'll always be considered an outsider and a suspected violent criminal with degenerate tendencies.
The cause of the change is AirBandB.¬† ¬†
I agree entirely!
My family has deep roots in the Bennington area, spanning several generations. Our last name appears on local road signs, and it‚Äôs so common here that it fills four pages in the phone book. Many of my neighbors are distant relatives who share my last name. It‚Äôs a tight-knit community‚Äîalmost like a little family commune. If someone needs help, I‚Äôm there in a heartbeat, and they do the same for me. We never exchange money or keep score; it‚Äôs just understood that we look out for each other.

I find it amusing when outsiders describe us as having a 'hippie' vibe. Maybe that‚Äôs more of a Burlington thing! Here, many of us own farms, make maple syrup, hunt, fish, and yes, we enjoy our fair share of locally crafted brews. It‚Äôs a simple life, close to nature, and I wouldn‚Äôt trade it for anything.
I‚Äôm from Maine I get it
LOL
I‚Äôm from Maine I know!
Which is worse Manchester or Bennington
nope
I did the same thing! I used to go to NYC every weekend and stay with my ex!
Vermont left an impression on you though, didn't it <3
South Burlington is the safest city in America, and Burlington is not far behind, a new ranking says.

Personal finance company WalletHub just released its list of safest cities in America, and South Burlington took the top spot, while Burlington came in at No. 4.
I wouldn‚Äôt say those things are ‚Äúimportant to me.‚Äù I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs just more representative of the overall stuff. I wanted to buy Doc Martens one time and between the only two shoe stores I couldn‚Äôt find a pair. 

I know it sounds silly, but the lack of options is simply distressing to me. I‚Äôve never really lived in a place where you couldn‚Äôt get to something quickly. 

I‚Äôll say, I do love that the hospital is right near the center of town. Those folks are some of the best people I‚Äôve ever met
I love Wilmington, but I also had roots here since childhood. I have never felt excluded here as a ‚Äúflatlander‚Äù, and I am a working class teacher, not rich by any means. I guess it all depends on your perspective. Its a damn sure more welcoming and kind place than anyplace in Jersey, and most of the unkindness I witness here is from visiting Jersey people. Imagine that. üòÇ
Feel you there, born and raise and can‚Äôt wait to move out
Thank you!! Like I said, this could happen anywhere. I just have a bad taste in my mouth because a number of bad things happened in a row. 

There are things that I genuinely love about being here, but they‚Äôre out weighed by the things that suck
I‚Äôm also a Mainer. I prefer the Maine attitudes to the VT ones
I just moved to Vermont but Mainers stole my heart. The KINDEST people I've ever come across.
Based on the way you talk about them in your other comments, they‚Äôd be far better off if you left and just let them go on with their lives without you.
I think it‚Äôs ok to put bad energy out there when you‚Äôre going through a decidedly bad time. My job requires to be on like 24/7, I‚Äôm burnt out, living in a motel, and much of my belongings are gone. To add to that, I‚Äôm sick from toxic mold exposure. On a more personal level, my mother is dying of lung cancer, and I‚Äôve just broken up with my fianc√©. Maybe I‚Äôm not in the position to think of things I‚Äôm grateful of. You don‚Äôt know me. I‚Äôm typically a positive person with a lot of energy, but I feel like I‚Äôve been beaten to a pulp by all this crap
RIGHT it‚Äôs like a western movie when the stranger walks into the bar
Well that‚Äôs just like, your opinion <pronoun>
*Provincial* is the correct word.
My health insurance and income are now tied to this state. Not so easy to just leave
Guy talks about a small part of Bennington as if it's the whole town. why not just say my life sucks?
Truth...and i was born here left and came back...sometimes I am like what a fuck show...literally. Lund center baby!!
Yea kinda makes me wonder if people say raising a family is good there, mean it's good for the parents lifestyle.
Having grown up and spend much of my 20's in rural vt I used to laugh when friends showed me what it was like to use dating apps..


I was like these are all the women we know.. just call one..


I worked with a bartender who had a great joke about how small the pool of single women is in small town VT.. "It's not your girlfriend it's just your turn"


Sad level of truth in that statement
Maine if you prefer rural, and it's not even close. You need to buy property though, if you're going to rent, just stay wherever you are. But it obviously depends on your hobbies/employment.
Man this is going to be unpopular but you can have a lovely experience in central Connecticut. Nice suburban neighborhoods with friendly families long connected bike trails and really high wages. To me it is the place to raise a family.
Western mass 30 min from Northampton or Amherst.
Connecticut. It‚Äôs North, but not too North! It‚Äôs close to both Boston and New York. The weather isn‚Äôt as severe as a Maine or Vermont or New Hampshire. It‚Äôs close enough to visit Massachusetts and Rhode Island for the beaches. And near Cape Cod for vacations.
Southern NH for sure
Massachusetts by far. Providence, Rhode Island can be good too. There are a lot of colleges and universities there which keeps the inner city young.
Probably rural Maine or New Hampshire.
Connecticut, near New York, or Massachusetts, near Boston. But each person has their own definition of what they want out of a location in their 30s.
Connecticut if you can afford it. Litchfield county
I‚Äôm from RI and miss it so much
Western CT. Loads of hiking, fishing, outdoor activities and safe
MA has literally the best HDI in the country and one of the tops in the world. It‚Äôs absolutely no contest: MA if you can afford it.
Massachusetts
Not New England. New England is dying because it's mostly designed for rich boomers.
The biggest city in Vermont doesn't even qualify as a city by most international definitions.


There are a few golden tickets here. OnLogic, Beta, I've heard good things about PCC, and there are some great options for certain healthcare fields (nurses get kinda dunked on tho).


Honestly though, if you want decent wages you almost always need to work remotely. My girlfriend worked for the state for awhile, she has a master's degree and several years experience in her field and was in a managerial role. I earned more than her working an entry level warehousing job. It's wild how depressed wages are.
The absolute worst. Wouldn't recommend.
I have this as a sticker on my water bottle lol
YESSSS THANK YOU. 

my favorite story is when I had my car running in the winter, about to run into the food shelf. I was there for like 3 minutes testing my blood sugar and giving myself insulin on my pump before going inside, clearly taking care of my type 1 diabetes. This woman knocks on my window and tells me about the town ordinance to not idle cars. I‚Äôve been living here forever. I know about the ordinance. I didn‚Äôt think it would be an issue with anyone. I was just trying to keep warm so my blood flowed to my damn fingers. That was the second time it‚Äôs happened. 

A woman also once chewed my husband out for leaving our dog in the car, even though IT WAS ON AND I WAS IN THERE WITH HIM. She looked at me right in the eyes too. I was wondering what she wanted but she left to go yell at my husband before I could ask. 

These are the one on one interactions that stick out, but I have a few major issues with other similar behavior.
Yes nailed it.
*Do you all have ciabatta bread in New York?*
This is a perfect descriptor.
Sounds like the gatekeepers on  r/Adirondacks. i went hiking there recently told my story and all the redditors in my thread were basically telling me never to come back lol
Not true. We just hate pur towns getting crowded and crime following. Grew up in VT and still live here. Sorry but after covid we got a lot of ppl escaping their towns and now burlington is full of crime and drugs- happy I dont live there either. It's not all out of staters , but a lot are.
 Nothing to do with gatekeeping. We just like our space and keeping to ourselves. We don't want city and billboards and such. We have a "yogis" in a town over. It's a ugly shop with a computer style sign advertising beer and vape and such. Take the ugly back to Mass please. And no I am not a hippie. But hate more ppl in my state. We want the room and no overcrowding. Not what I now see on my commute to work. Tons of cars. Double what it was before covid.
Found the dude from Connecticut everybody!
What in the actual fuck are you yammering on about? 

I think we found the guy with his eyes closed everyone.....
Except Heady Topper.
Gotta love the tourist who post on here saying "I come to VT a few times a year and love it. Am I considered a Vermonter?"  ü§£ü§£ü§£
That‚Äôs kind of everywhere, Vermont isn‚Äôt special. We‚Äôre all ‚Äúfull‚Äù
You nailed dude. Perfect assessment. Please tell everyone the same!!! üëç
Out of curiosity, how many of the locals were born in Vermont?  

There also seems to be a big difference in native Vermonters depending on generation.  Boomers and older still tend to have that I can fix anything, do it myself, do what's right attitude.
The fact that you had to use the word ‚Äútolerated‚Äù really illustrates the problem, don‚Äôt you think?
I grew up in the shadow of Smugglers Notch vt and unless you went to high school with us or have been a fixture for 5-10 years you are most likely just the out of state "flatlander" who most likely won't stick around..¬†


Ultra cliquey people and I have heard people say they didn't feel like a local even after nearly a decade in vt..


When a new face walks into the bars it can be like in a movie when the music stops and everybody looks at them in shock before deciding that they don't know them and don't want to..¬† Just one more soul from the elsewhere's of life who is going to want things to be like wherever it is they come from and take just a little more of the coveted wild out of VT.


I live in Maine now.. Vt has become overrun with people working remote since covid.. most of the farms I grew up working/ hunting/ fishing are dead and being subdivided or covered in solar panels.. Every single off leash dog walking path has mandatory leash signs now.. Saw numerous out of stater's flip out and start screaming when they saw off leash dogs in the last 6-8 years and lo and behind now leashes are mandatory.. ON EVERY SINGLE TRAIL IN THE COUNTY! We have to Bushwhack far from marked trails to let our dogs run in the woods now. Too many people move to vt and post the land we grew up hunting/ fishing/ 4 wheeling.


New people in vt have a tough time because so many that have come before you have incited change and chipped away at the wild west existence we grew up enjoying in the 90's.. you may be well intentioned but you have to prove that to us before being accepted as a local and if you don't step on any toes and keep showing up at local events for SEVERAL years maybe, just maybe we will contemplate indoctrinating you into our inner circles and tightly knit friend groups that invite one another to go do things in small units..¬†


Vt is trapped in the 50's in lots of wonderful and intolerable ways.


Vermont is quiet, peaceful, ideal for the outdoorsy lifestyle and if people know and trust you they will take the shirt off their backs with the only question being what else can I do to help.. but for you outsiders it's a bewilderingly hostile infestation of rednecks and hippies who don't know you, don't won't want to and hope you move away soon.


For all the people out there who don't like VT I request that you spread this message as far and wide as you are able
It's a bad place to move to.. VT wants as many of you as possible to stay in Massachusetts or wherever.. It's rainy and overcast in the summer, spring is aptly named mud season, gets overrun with leafpeepers in the fall and becomes a frozen wasteland in winter. It's lily white, racist, taxes are almost as high as the cost of living and the traffic is worse than it ever was. It's like nobody is in a hurry to get anywhere and the pace of life is just all slowed down like vt is under a rock.


Make sure you never go there to verify how horrible it is.¬† Take my unbiased word that it's hell on earth.. Nothing grows there.. the hunting and trout fishing is abysmal.. the food is way too locally sourced and fresh, the farmers markets are just loaded with crunchy hippies, the skiing sucks because there are too few people in the lift lines to socialize with and the trails are erie and unsettling because they are nearly empty on weekdays. The people are just way too chatty and overfirendly with each other. The cheese is just awful.. The beer tastes so good that you will become an alcoholic.. the lakes are just too damn clean because of the godawful no gas motors laws (the nerve on these people), the legal lack of billboards makes it so that you have no idea what the state of consumerism is like. The anti GMO laws are just stupid.. The cops are just way too present and friendly with people.. There are 4 wheelers and dirt bikes driving legally all over the roads (many of which are still unpaved)


You don't want to come to vt and most of vt doesn't want you here
From a Maine point of view I‚Äôd equate moving to Bennington as a 20 something professional the same as moving to a place like Waterville, Sanford, or skowhegan.
Born in Maine... guessing south of Bangor if you had rural redefined for you.
I was born and raised here. It's easy to not fit in here. I'm sorry you're struggling it's a lonely place when it's like that. There was a point in time when all my friends and family moved away or died and it felt very cold and empty here.

It's a great place when you live a lifestyle and have a home where your life is completed there and you don't have many needs from the outside world other than work. But when you don't have that already built or aren't living that way it's cold and desolate
Real Vermonters are neither pretentious nor cold. You are mistaking the annoying people who have moved here with actual Vermonters.
St. Albans would like a word....

St. Johnsbury entered the chat.
I have friends in Rutland lol. Granted I met them all at Killington
i laughed out loud
it doesn‚Äôt. it only seems that way when you listen purely to terminally online redditors
It's the property taxes. If it was cheaper to live here then it wouldn't hurt so much to deal with everything else.
Cause we are all weirdos who love our adorable small villages and its warped our brains? lol
This right here. 

And some small towns can be just as clique-y as your average high school, if not more so. If the Town Administrator is BFFs with the selectboard, then you're looking at one big circle jerk. And this is where *potentially* corruption, intentionally or unintentionally, can also occur. 

The selectboard wants something done that is ehhhh potentially questionable, then the TA will play daily interference, selectively edit minutes, spin as needed. All while the selectboard can overlook the personnel issues with the TA (overall poor performance, lack of necessary skills, being overcompensated, etc).

And you can't forget all the "special" meetings that only require 24hrs public notice, so barely anyone knows about them or are able to attend.

Ya know, fun stuff like that. All of which I have witnessed first hand and been a victim of.

Or maybe just my town is royally fucked up ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
It‚Äôs like a‚Ä¶ locals only vibe. I mean, I get it. Nobody really wants transplants unless you‚Äôre a hippie dippy transient type.
People come out of the rain.
A local NH term for back yard. 
Yes, I too am a flat lander who moved to NH in 
‚Äú81‚Äù. It took awhile to get used to some of the local culture. 
Vermont and NH are similar, though not as much today, politically. I definitely remember feeling that people were cold and unfriendly. It‚Äôs really not the case at all. There‚Äôs a charm about Northern New England that takes time to appreciate. 
I have no regrets.
I‚Äôm living in Bennington right now, covered in tattoos + stretched ears. Drive a lowered attention seeking vehicle and still no one bothers me here. Some people really just have a victim mentality.
Dude I'm a bi lady in a hybrid we are doing just fine around here thanks lol
The truck driving thing blew my mind. I went from a tiny hatchback to a tundra and it was like I was in a whole new world. Constantly being cutoff to being king of the road. Invisible to cops. Just insane how much differently you're treated based on a seemingly minor switch.
Okay I just bought a white truck, but only because VW and Subaru have been such nightmares to own, I figured let's get a Toyota, makes the driveway easier, and I can go to the dump. I swear I'm not hill people.
I've lived here my whole life. I am Asian, I drive a plug in EV, and am an independent who has voted Democrat my whole adult life. Most of my friends are guys I've met through landscaping or ski shop jobs who have trucks, guns, and love Trump. Sounds like you're the judgmental one not the so called "hicks" who live here.
The Bennington area is one of the more xenophobic regions in Vermont. Weirdly enough it sounds like this guy would have been happier in Brattleboro.
That‚Äôs a tad judgmental.
Then you get the woke women who snarl if you hold a door open or wave.¬† ¬† ¬†Between the 2 its a lonely place.¬† ¬†Im here for my dog.
Thanks for the laugh.  This is why I Reddit.
That sounds like a good plan for you. You're really not happy here. :-/
A good chunk of Bennington is low income, so you're going to be kind of an anomaly being a 20 something professional. I think you'd find the same experience in most of Vermont's "cities" (Rutland, Brattleboro, Barre, St Johnsbury, even Troy NY). There's a young professionals group in the area that might be good for networking and finding friends.
That was a really weird assumption that person made, I can‚Äôt see what got them there from the problems you have had. Having grown up in Vermont I think it seems like you have been dealt a shit hand and sometimes it doesn‚Äôt work out. I moved away and my problems were the same as yours, albeit with the exact opposite background. I missed that everyone in Vermont waived when driving down the road, said thank you when I held a door open, and were always very kind. Maybe it is Bennington or a stroke of bad luck which unfortunately happens. Sorry that has been your experience but sometimes ya just gotta roll with it and head on off to the next opportunity. I‚Äôm doing that as we speak because I don‚Äôt like where I live as well.
Sooo my theory is that so many out of staters have come and taken advantage of Vermont folks, time and time again, that most Vermonters now have a heavy heavy shield up against outsiders..
Then consider yourself lucky and have a bit more patience and empathy for your "cold and standoffish" neighbors who are very likely just struggling through each and every day. We can't assume anything about you really from this post, but if you are making decent money at a professional job and finding that many lower income folks are being "cold and standoffish" to you then there may be something in your behavior or how you present yourself that makes them feel as though you are looking down on them. Struggling vermonters have a hard time with "outsiders" who are in a better place than them for a variety of reasons and may play into this. 

Not saying it's an excuse or anything, but something you may want to be mindful and thoughtful of. OR just remember so that you don't take it too personally next time. 

As an example, I live in a very small rural town that is mostly blue collar folks. I work in Burlington doing a professional job that pays pretty well. When I stop at my local general store after work wearing my professional attire I am treated 100% differently by the patrons and the staff who don't know me well than when I show up at the same store on Saturday morning in dirty carhartts, beat up boots, and an old hat on. I don't take it personally - these folks aren't really used to interacting with a dude in business casual attire and assume we have nothing in common. It may seem standoffish but they just genuinely don't know how to interact with me. Some may even assume I'm looking down on them or think I'm better than them. But if someone I know well comes up and says "hey whaletacochamp - gonna be working the woods this weekend?" anyone within earshot drops their guard because they know I'm "one of them" - i just happen to also have a white collar job. 

Vermonters are a nuanced bunch. Try not to take things so personally.
Agree. Moved here in my early 20s and have had essentially nothing but positive experiences, aside from a few minor things here and there.
My neice turned nephew is following that lifestyle, and you are all welcome.  It's not easy here, just remember that.
Do you HAVE to live in Bennington? I've been critical of Vermont, but I've never experienced this level of alienation. And I'm Black! I've never lived in Bennington though - Middlebury, with a lot of time spent in Bristol, Vergennes, Brandon, Williston, and Burlington, and Ive had about as good a time as you could possibly have being a Black migrant in an overwhelmingly white state. Maybe Bennington sucks? Idk
Bennington isn't a representation of the entire state. Move out of that town and you'll have a much better experience.
You are in a better position than the majority of Vermonters. I suggest you go out of your way to talk to some of your neighbors and actually learn about them, you'll likely find they aren't the monsters you're making them out to be and you aren't so misfortunate as you make yourself out to be. I'm also picking up that you're probably a bit lonely and having a hard time finding social connection which is understandable but not an excuse to demonize everyone around you. Therapy may be beneficial. Your job can probably help you with that.
Airbnb
It would be no problem!
As someone relatively new to VT I‚Äôve heard this a lot, and it‚Äôs simply not true. I casually and politely have introduced myself to neighbors, service industry workers in the neighborhood, and people in clubs or community events and they all respond with a ‚ÄúWTF why are they talking to me‚Äù attitude. Someone down the hall in my apt building has a welcome mat outside their door that literally says ‚ÄúGo Away‚Äù, which represents the majority well.
Oh come on... I made friends with the Pakistani family that bought the liqueur store. Stop being so crazy.
Burlington is not safe. Whoever designated Burlington as safe needs to have their head examined.
It‚Äôs okay to not be made for Vermont. Plenty of people feel uncomfortable in certain places; I‚Äôve had to work in Detroit several times and found it to be a repulsive, decrepit wasteland, but some people find that it energizes them, and that‚Äôs okay too. 

Living in Vermont means planning ahead, and it always has. In exchange for that, we get locally-owned stores, we get communities that care for one another*, and we don‚Äôt have to look like the rest of the country. I travel for work (which is the only reason I can afford to live here), and there are few places in the US that actually look tonally distinct. For all of Vermont‚Äôs zoning woes, the small towns of Vermont do genuinely have their own look. Sometimes that means we argue about sign colors and ‚ÄúOpen‚Äù flags, but it does mean most of Vermont doesn‚Äôt look like South Carolina and Pennsylvania and Ohio and Iowa and Arizona, full of strip malls and chain stores. If you‚Äôre near this stuff, like Bennington, or Williston, or Springfield, you might as well live someplace else.

*Bennington has always been rather unpleasant. I did a couple promotional projects for the town years and years ago, and even then people seemed to prefer being angry over improving their town‚Äôs image (at no cost to them, I might add). The general tone seemed to be that if Bennington were to become more pleasant, the townspeople would have no scapegoat on which to blame their lack of success. Bennington is the [‚Äúdrowning in shallow water‚Äù meme](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.knowyourmeme.com/memes/drowning-in-shallow-water), made into a town.
New Jersey‚Äôs unkindness is because they wish so badly to be from NY.
It sucks because I want to but don't. I just want it to be fixed and stop sucking. But IDK if that'll happen
Appreciate the correct word. English isn‚Äôt my first language.
Well.. I think they mean it more in the sense of it's a much easier place to live if you don't have to worry about playing the single game. The average age is older, which is going to mean that the majority of people are either married or in some form of domestic partnership. Therefore, most social events are going to cater more towards the married or married with kids crowd. From there it's a feedback loop: the social atmosphere caters more toward married couples, this means the single folks are left lonely and destitute so they move out, more younger married folks move in because, "oh look at all the cute couple things we can do".
Maine is not friendly. It‚Äôs the same issues OP listed.
CT gets dunked on by the rest of NE but I love it. Great climate compared to lots of the region (especially within 30m of the water, it's *always* mild), near everything, shockingly affordable compared to some other NE states if you look in the right places since wages tend to keep up.¬†


Fuck the ticks, though. The ticks are absolutely insane down there.
That‚Äôs where I am. It is an expensive state to live in though. Prices are high on everything here.
Greenfield, for example.
This is a very clean nice area, last time I visited was maybe 15yr ago. I have a aunt in Northampton, she has been there for 30yr and is quite happy
Seems what goes around comes around
I grew up in Northampton in the '60's.  Both my sister and I graduated from NHS
although my parents were from California I was treated well for the most part 
I couldn't wait to get out and never did live there again but I will always be in my heart a "Hampster"
i.e. a person from Hamp which is what the town was called then.
My sister went back to the valley after she retired and she loves it. 
I got out and now I read it's the really cool place to be in New England 
Who knew
Keene is pretty nice.
I really miss living in PVD. If RI had better public transportation, it would be the best place to live, but their system is god awful/lacking, so you're just stuck in traffic for freaking ever.

Scurvydog might be amongst the best dives I've found.
I had a water bottle for a while with like 5 of those from different states lol.

I think it had park city, Jackson hole, vermont,  Austin
Had a lady freak out on me for an idling car. Needed an alternator and the car might not start if I turned it off. Explained the situation to her and she said ‚Äútypical man that doesn‚Äôt care about anything‚Äù. If she had been a man I might have punched her right in the mouth.¬†
Oh, I‚Äôve got a story like this! I was pulling out of a parking spot on a residential street and put my foot on the brake after a few feet because I realized I needed to look up directions. After about 30 seconds, a lady walks up on the adjacent sidewalk with a death stare. I roll down my window and she gives me attitude about ‚Äúwhat are you doing in front of my driveway‚Äù (she was not pulling out her car). I politely apologized and said I would be gone momentarily. She was not appeased, at all. She jumped in her car that was parked in the spot now in front of me and proceeds to run her windshield wipers but somehow her windshield wiper fluid continues to splash back onto my car about 20ft back. She really showed me! /s üòÇ
Nah there‚Äôs no Italians in NY to make it. And I think vermonts the only state that ever feeds grass to their cows too

Nice try
Everyone saying ‚Äúoh ya don‚Äôt come here‚Äù like they are being sly with that sarcasm bs. Let me put it in a way a guy from Vermont could understand. It‚Äôs like some skier who found great powder but tells everyone in the lodge you won‚Äôt find it on so and so chairlift. 
Like I said and what OP confirms y‚Äôall are intolerant while trying to put off some hippy love everyone facade. When in reality you‚Äôre the least diverse group of people with no patience or care to include any outsider in any fun you may produce. 

Quite sickening really. As if someone else looking at nice foliage or some shit somehow makes it less beautiful for you.  Get a grip bro.
[deleted]
Does VT offer birthright Vermontership? Or do I lose my Vermonter status after some time away? 

I wish I could come back, but the job market just doesn‚Äôt support that right now.
Just because a cat gave birth in the oven doesn't make the kittens muffins ...
Lol its a backwater state nobody actually cares about Vermont that much
Probably 2/3.  I know one dude is from CT but been here 25 years, and another from Maine originally.
Yeah, kind of.  Best I could hope for.  I feel like as much as I get irritated by cars with out of state plates, I've been somewhat indoctrinated though.
That was cool to read, thanks.  I'm not leaving though.  I am a hippy punk redneck, I'll fit in eventually.  I don't meet any of your flatlander stereotypes, don't worry.
Maybe. To be honest, Bennington had greater access to things than Waterville or Skowhegan. For example, it takes 50 min to an hour to get to Albany from Bennington, then there‚Äôs an Amtrak to NYC. However, it takes longer to get to Portland from Skowhegan and the Amtrak to Boston is less frequent and longer. I feel like Bennington is a bit more like Biddeford or maybe even Lewiston
I was born in Bangor.
Federal money downtown revitalization juxtaposed against a backdrop of homeless drug addicts and pan handlers.
St Albans is leagues nicer than Rutland or Bennington.
I think Brattleboro's actually worse than Rutland now lol.
I love St J. It‚Äôs on the up and up and actually attainable to buy a house for younger people trying to settle down and start a family like us at 31/32 (granted the one we bought in Lyndonville needed/still needs a ton of work). Writing this as I cook chili and simultaneously replace a rotted sill plate lol.

We lived in Denver for a long time and crime/homeless people here (even Burlington) doesn‚Äôt even compare to what went on out there, let alone any other city we‚Äôve been to. I love VT and my neighbors are so welcoming and sweet, even those with some *different* view points on things. The NEK is absolutely gorgeous and still has the old Vermont vibe IMO. I do hope OP finds his happy place.
Seems like towns with jails suck because they get everyone else's problems!
Lived in VT for 18 years state blows goats period. It‚Äôs way too expensive for what is available. There‚Äôs no business there what so ever. Property taxes are outrages 
Lake Champlain is a toilet . Cow shit and blue green algae all over the lake. 
Pretty mountains and  sceneryTHAT IS IT. 
Left 8 years ago went back last summer  the biggest city Burlington is a trash pile now. Run down buildings crack heads all over. 
Do not move to VT unless your rich
Nah, I'm from small town NEK. Same shit up here. Selective editing of meeting minutes and backdoor Selectboard fuckery is the norm. I've spent the better part of two years fighting them tooth and nail while they try to change the town's ordinance to allow ATV's on all roads. Guess what...all five selectboard members were ATV enthusiasts. I'm running this March to unseat at least one of them and am going to be a procedural pain in their ass until they come to their senses about it
Good lord, this sounds exactly like my town and the former Town Administrator. Shit was all fucked up.
Very true the cops love trucks it would seem
Your safe none of the hill people would be caught dead in a Toyota :)
Preach hill people can be very fun and we all get along pretty good right :)
He said in a comment down below he makes 40k. That's not really a livable wage here.
That makes sense. I‚Äôm not here to take advantage. I‚Äôm here to make an honest living working at a non-profit lol
Way to try to write off the shitty attitudes a lot of Vermonters have. I get a kick out of people who call others Flatlander, but they themselves couldn‚Äôt survive 1 day in actual mountains.
If you belong you belong and all us creepy hill people can tell " one of us one of us" :)
Also Black, can confirm Bennington just sucks.
Haha, thank you for adding the ‚Äúand I‚Äôm black‚Äù bit. Honestly, so glad you haven‚Äôt experienced that. What I remember from when I lived in VT (my whole childhood) was the distinct lack of diversity.
Well that's the first thing to move into town. I had one pop up directly next door to me I. The middle of the woods 3 years ago. Plagued!
Where do you live in vermont?  It makes a difference...
Hahaha that is doubtful. I grew up in Southern Jersey where people are much kinder; my sons still live there and are awesome people. But I moved from Central Jersey shore where most of the people are NY or Philly transplants and they are the rudest people around. So I am going with people who transplant TO Jersey from other places are rude. And people who leave Jersey because of the rude people are more apt to keep to themselves and avoid said people, especially when they visit Vermont. üòÇ
In fact most horrible drivers and people hassling locals have either Jersey or NY tags. Go figure.
Boy do I feel the same way, like I want vt to have all things we have but like more too lol and be less expensive and less sucky so I can stay
As someone  who  grew  up  in  Maine and still lives here   this is absolutely correct  people  who were born here  or raised here don't like out of staters  whatsoever, like hell people with out of state plates have gotten run off the road in some parts of the state. OP I'd highly suggest  avoiding  Maine unless your old, really wealthy  or move to the shithole that is Portland , South Portland  isn't to bad, but if you move rural it's 50/50 if your  neighbors  are going to hate you
Yeah can be. But to me high prices are super localized. We live in an expensive area but our house nationally would be a pretty reasonable price. It‚Äôs an older cape. We were able to raise a family of 3 boys on 1 and a half persons salary. (My wife stayed home for years).
Yes - I've lived in Greenfield - great young and older community - I took courses at Greenfield Community (if it's still called that).  I've also lived in Noho and Sunderland and...  Belchertown a little further up!  I spent a lot of time in Western Mass. :)  But I think Greenfield is the best place to land.
My grandparents grew up in the valley and operated a funeral home in Northampton from the 50s to the 80s. It was a very different town back then. Lots of change from the 80s on. Massive gentrification
God that is so frustrating. I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôd have stopped you if you did. I just don‚Äôt understand THAT of all things to get self righteous and upset about. There are so many other things people do that have a much larger carbon footprint. It‚Äôs like that‚Äôs the only thing they can do to make themselves feel important, going around and finding all the idling cars.
I get that you might have had bad experience with some people but kind of odd to be so judgmental and showing your hypocrisy. Like all love to you bud but maybe you just were around wrong area or people. I‚Äôve traveled around and love the community feel and acceptance of Vermont the best. But each person will have different interactions. To each their own and your experience might have been with intolerant people. But most of us are pretty accepting of everyone from my lifetime here. Kind of more of a live and let live than ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù.
Good forbid they photograph a pretty barn landscape.
You have not described any Vermonters I know including myself
Ha ha listen to you what you mad about ? go eat some fruit or something.
People say that about every desirable state lfmao
And you wonder why people in Vermont don't like you.   ü§£ü§£

I comprehend exactly what you're saying, and its just plain wrong.   Maybe i should dumb it down for you?
I honestly think its more of a state of mind, and an attitude rather than lineage.  I know some folks that moved here from a big city, but adopted the life and held true to the lifestyle, instead of trying to push for change.   Those folks, in my mind, are just as much a Vermonter as someone born here with 10 generations of family from here.   The part that pisses people off, is trying to make Vermont convenient and "Proper" according to how folks live in the City.  Oh, and burlington doesn't count as a city, its barely big enough, and well, failing as a city.  (I'll get a bunch of downvotes just for saying that)
Nah its state of mind some people just are Vermonters and a lot of people aren't just how it is.
If born in Vermont, you are always a Vermonter!
Agreed, that‚Äôs why I worked in NYC 30 years.
They call themselves ‚ÄúNatives‚Äù , usually white people whose parents or grandparents moved here.  The Native Americans I know probably find it a little cringey.  There is also the people with 4 number license plates, that they got from their parents or grandparents, to signal that they have been here first.
You're way more Vermont than 90% of the people here
I have an awesome job in VT  and always have
I would love to hear Trump try to explain that sentence. üòÇ
I like muffins... are there berries??
A true woodchuck has entered the chat
Benningtons not actually rural. Manchester isnt either. It's like 16k pop and 4000 which is small but it's that many people in tiny areas and every surrounding town is populated. There's very little ruralness to the Northshire or Southshire. You don't get rural until you get a few towns away from each
Id rather hang in bratt than rut or burl. It's a mess but it's a better vibe.
Agree. I‚Äôm in Barnet, moved here last winter, and it‚Äôs like heaven on earth. I can‚Äôt believe I get to live in such a beautiful, kind place. Such nice people. St. J is adorable and nothing like I remember it 15-20 years ago when I was at Goddard. It‚Äôs vibe glows. I could not be happier.
Good observation!
Yet here you fucking are
We don't miss you don't worry
Glad you left. Don't come back.
I'm also from a small town in the NEK...gotta love the BS that happens within the town.
May I ask which town?
People in the northeast in general are pretty standoffish though.many of his complaints like "not saying thank you" when you hold the door is also gonna happen in any major east coast city.
Being from away myself a new resident to Maine, I have not had this problem, except for driving oddly enough. It was noticeable on the road before I changed my plates. Once I had Maine plates other Maine drivers started being a lot more friendly. But no problem with the people and my job has me traveling all over the state talking to folks.
My family has been in this area since the 1600s on both sides. As a southern Vermonter, it‚Äôs not the same here as when I was young or even like 5 years ago. I feel like we‚Äôre cursed being between NY and Mass.
Lol, my grandma would disagree (if she weren‚Äôt dead). To her Montpelier was the biggest city she wanted to go to üòÑ.
This. Exactly this.
I'm fifth generation here. Family came here to cut stone in the early 1800's.  My eighth generation neighbor has always referred to my family as "the transplants". That shit just rolls downhill.



Neither where someone is from nor how long they have lived in a place is indicative of how  good of a neighbor they are.  I imagine most "true Vermonters" don't focus on it... there's just too many ruts to fill.
As a Vermont "Native" that can trace my lineage to the native american tribes living here and southern Quebec, i don't find it "cringey" at all.  I think that folks that have moved here can't get the respect they believe they deserve from actual natives, and have taken a lot of insult to that.   Vermont has always had a very specific way of life due to the harsh climate and difficult terrain, and it took a special type of patience and attitude to live here.  What the "Natives" are getting mad about, is folks coming in and trying to change that type of life.  In their minds, these people "from away" are trying to bring their big city problems to a usually slow, and hard life that we are used to.  Also, we tend to be very stubborn, and keep to the motto "If it ain't broke, don't try to fix it".   

Word of advice, don't judge people too hard if you don't understand their lifestyle and mindset.
I can find census records back 9th generations, all farmers up until my grandfather sold his farm when I was little.
Nah dude, we definitely call each other vermonters not natives... That's some s*** rich people came up with.
Oh I just mean that I can‚Äôt find a job/salary match in VT - not that the job market is bad.
they‚Äôre not exactly metropolitan either though
Istg this subreddit is mostly people that don't live here who have a weird fixation on the state
You wouldn‚Äôt be so offended if it wasn‚Äôt true.
***Barton has entered the chat and has started throwing punches***
Yeah I think it has more to do with plates on cars then anything else I'm black and lived in rural Maine never had to deal with  anything in person expect for the passive comments from boomers but I've definitely  noticed  some people  are Dicks to out of staters  on the road
My grandparents didn't leave the nek. That is their choice.
As someone who grew up in Barnet/St Johnsbury for my first 20 years and have lived in the greater Burlington area for the next 20 years, it's funny to see how NEK people treat this area. When I was in college I lived right off the interstate, next to purple knights pizza (RIP) and my dad would get stressed about just that little venture into "the city" lol
True Vermonters of old didnt have to think about the difference because there werent any "others" here. The fundemental Verrmonter philosophy was live and let live. Imdont care what you do, just leave me alone to do my thing. We'll cooperate when we need to, and we'll work hard when we do. 

Short history lesson, this ended in the 60s and 70s. The so called hippie commune movement invaded. Being as they were, Vermonters lived and let live. You wanna be a hippie, have at it. Slowly, the state has been swollen with ex-urbanites who moved here with the idea that Vermonters liked hippies because they shared similar values. They really didn't. Vermonters are real independent, you're respnsible for yourself types. You all probably didnt onoe that Vermont to this day has voted for Repubkucan governors and presidents more than any other state. There were few democrats prior to the 1970s. Point is, the folks that have moved here iver the last 50 years or so, as compared to the population that comes from stock that lived here earlier, were wealthier, more 'eastern educated', and considerably closer to the hippies that started then in migration than the so called Vermonters. But hey, live and let live right?

Now it's the folks from somewhere else, for the most part who are in the driver's seat. The Vermont of today is a society not exactly of the Vermont tradition. You'll hear the powers that be talk about keeping our historic past, conserving our agricultural heritage, rehabilitating our important structures, keeping our landscapes open. That's all well and good, problem is that the people deciding what to 'protect' have no idea what this 'past' they want to save looked like. Invariably, they're protection efforts result in creating a Vermont that is nothing like it was and guaranteeing it will be nothing like Vermonters ever would have planned for. But, live and let live, right?

This has left a good number of Vermonters less than excited about getting to know the new folks in town, as just by looking around its pretty clear they didn't get to know Vermonters. Vermonters seem gruff and a little uninterested in strangers. Well, that'll happen when you're alienated in your own towns. A few examples of things Vermonters look sideways at. 

For many decades Vermonters kept billboards off our roads. Despite the income many landowners could have made directing folks to ski areas and vacation lakes, the landscape was more important. Then in a matter of a decade, there are solar farms at least as landscape damaging as billboards just everywhere. "I like them it makes me feel proud!" Vermont is one of the cloudiest places on the continent. Just saying, Burlington has more cloudy days than any city in America but Portland, OR.

No development, no development, no development. Zoning restrictions and an unpredictable permitting process in a place where construction labor and material cost are always high. Oh my god a housing crisis! How did this happen? Greedy rich people?? Meanwhile, to "save family farms" the state spends millions to buy development rights from family farms injecting cash to the farm but removing the development potential the land had. Hasn't saved farms. Gave old farmers retirement money and lowered the value of the land which has been swallowed up by ever increasingly large agri-business farms. Fewer farmers, more milk, less land to develop, higher costs for purchasing land to develop for housing, and more of a housing shortage. Vermonters shake their heads. "But we're saving farmland and Vermont's historic agricultural economy!". Fun fact: Manufacturing outpaced agriculture as bigger portion of the state economy in 1830 and never turned back. Think mill towns making wooden bobbins from the timber industry. 

The conservation of the metal i-beam skeleton of the old moran plant on probably some of the finest waterfront land IN THE WORLD. How about the circ? You know the one in Essex. That was supposed to go from Colchester to where it is now to I-89 just south of the Big Box exit. Not 35 or 40 minutes from Colchester to Williston, but 10. Stopped by environmental lawsuits. It had over 80% public support, was nearly totally funds by the feds, and all the land for the right of way was purchased. Who brought the suits? Out of state in migration attorneys, chief attorney - yup, Peter Welch. Ever seen the file cabinet sculpture down near Redstone Park? It's like a 60 foot tall stack of file cabinets. It represents the amount of paper work the Southern Connector Plan, also stopped by lawsuits, made before being scuttled. You know the southern connector. That skateboard park down at the end of Pine Street? 

These and many dozens of other "Flatlander" bungles have made Vermonters very skeptical of the new neighbors indeed.
Yeah I can trace both grandfather's all the way back to French Canadian fur trappers with native wives. we were told growing up the right people stay the wrong people leave and its none of our business as long as nobody is getting hurt.
My family cut ice to send to the middle east. 

Bout a mile or two from the B&J factory in Waterbury.
Yes, 100%
Exactly. Vermonters are gruff on the outside which reflects the self-sufficient attitude it takes to live in the North Country
I think that you are right about people moving here and wanting to change things (especially in Burlington and Stowe).  Things have changed in Vermont in the last 30-40 years. At some point in time ,unless you are a Native American , your ancestors came from not here.  I understand the yankee culture, and my family has lived in New England for as long as white people have lived here.  What I judge is when people say that they are Native to belittle other people, instead of talking about the history of why we do things the way we do .  There are many things that are awesome about Vermont and should be more present other places, like town meeting day, where everyone can have their say. Self reliance , and a willingness to help others in their time of need.
Agreed
That's ok your just one of our ambassadors then :)
It‚Äôs the same in every Vermont group on the internet. We have a local town Facebook group with 16k members and there are 13k human beings that even live here. People are a virus with shoes.
Hey neighbor!!
only mass holes and new Yorkers .. Mainers like cadence and Trust in other drivers. if you feel hate from a mainer may want to look in the mirror and know your audience.. or maybe your just a victim in general?
Thanks for the history lesson - life is nuanced and complex as you point out
Didn‚Äôt really see that coming.  ‚ÄúBlame it on the transplants‚Äù is a rich trope.   Isn‚Äôt everyone a transplant at some point?  Doesn‚Äôt really hold water.  ‚Äú everything sucks, here are the reasons it sucks, and these are the people that made it miserable‚Äù.   Ok  üëå
Bro, absolutely nailed it. üëå well done.
Interesting take. You started strong, but kinda flopped at the end.
Well said!  I believe that anyone who holds themselves above other people, for any reason, is not really being a good human.  That applies to folks from here, and in all parts of the globe we all share.  I do agree also that it really doesn't matter where you are from, as long as you understand where you are, and who you are with.  What you personally believe, may not be what the folks around you believe.  Vermonters that i grew up with were very tolerant to different kinds of attitudes, we didn't care what color your skin was, or where you were born.  It only mattered how you acted and treated everyone around you.    I have travelled around the US, and Canada, a little bit of Mexico, the Middle East, and South East Asia.  For a "xenophobe" as some like to call us, i think i've done well.  But Vermont will always be my home, and i want to protect it from becoming just another place that got run over by "progress" for the sake of it.
Applause!
I totally agree! Community is so important! Living in a city can feel impersonal. We're social creatures. I love Vermont and Vermonters, a lot of us are trying to keep the dream alive. Politics are an issue but a lot of Vermonters are still trying to meet their neighbors and forge community connections! I think the effort put into talking to the locals is already a facet of integrity and strength. Lately it feels like out-of-staters bring a completely different culture to the tender yet resilient state of Vermont. 

I like out of staters if they don't judge us and wanna be friendly and curious about our way of life. It would be nice if we could all live proudly and self-sufficiently, alongside each other. We're hard workers, not hustlers.
A bunch of years ago the Barton Selectboard routinely had shouting matches and fistfights.
I mean I've personally never dealt with anybody being a dick to me on the road but I also lived in a small town my whole life so I was like you knew everybody and everybody was nice to everybody it's like once you get into Portland or south Portland that it gets a little wild Westy with people being weenies and like 98% of the time the people that drive like weenies were people from out of state you are 100% correct that pretty much all mainers are nice to each other on the road it's on vacationers and people that live from out of state come up they're driving on the road becomes a living hell
You're a transplant aren't ya?
I don't know the part about the farmland is at the end and it's one of the strongest most impactful points.

There is a reason there were "don't Jersey Vermont" stickers on thousands of cars for multiple decades, along with t shirts etc and yeah that's basically it. The surrounding states wealth gentrified the state and made it way harder to live for the actual Vermonters and changed the way they lived, in almost 0 objectively positive ways
What?! When did that happen? And why am I not surprised?
What?! When did that happen? And why am I not surprised?
2017-2020, mainly 2019-2020. Trumpanzees‚Ä¶
If I find any Tourists lost on my property, I swear I'm gonna..
See if they want to smoke a joint and point them in the right direction. Try to be nice today. If an asshole like me can pull it off, you fuckers will be fine. We are all just primates hooting at the bright ball in the sky.
[deleted]
Adopt the Maine attitude....Don't be afraid to call them names while helping undo whatever mess they get themselves into.
It isn't that hard to be nice, is it? And if they're true assholes, it will piss them off if you don't go down that path. Win/win.
Love the energy of this post. Kindness is free and this is a cool thing. And people get to see our beautiful state :)
Good to know Im not the only one who likes engaging with visitors to the state (I'm the type that invites them in for a cup of earl grey)
This is the energy VT needs
I honestly would be nice about it but nicely and firmly ask them to stay on the town road right-of-way to enjoy it. I want people to enjoy the eclipse and I could certainly put up with the road crowded and parked in for a few hours but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with total strangers wandering around deep in on my land either.
Amen, comrade
Well said, Slutty McFuckstick.
Just remember you'll need your night vision setup for the totality...
Well said stranger.
That‚Äôs cool, but always send them on the scenic route.
Well said. I'll be out there on the zero gravity chairs with beers and bones.
If I'm an out of stater and hike up there every other week or so three seasons out of four, that makes me a tourist?
Username checks out.
Love This. üôåüèª ü•∞
Op, i really appreciate you
Hell yeah!
Love it and thank you for having a great attitude. Would smoke one with you too!
Love this message üëç‚òÄÔ∏èüåò
I love you.
This shit right here is the real Vermont. Props
Joe?
Help step Vermonter I‚Äôm stuck and don‚Äôt know what to do!!
Wish I got lost, haha! I'm genuinely sorry to have clogged your roads that bad, I was not expecting that for some reason. In 55 years, when there's an eclipse in my neck of the woods, feel free to swing through!
But‚Ä¶the dragon is going to eat the big fire in the sky.
I already shit in my catapult bowl and have it set to "detect whiteplate"
Idk what‚Äôs more cringey, the posts complaining about the tourists or the ones like this that serve no purpose other than to show how totally righteous and virtuous you are compared to those other mean people. 

How about this? We all just stop talking about the tourists and instead talk about this event.
Don‚Äôt encourage tourists to drive high please. They‚Äôre already crazy and stupid enough as it is
Ditto. I have pbrs‚Ä¶
Dude.....how many of us had exactly the same thought. I just like all of you so stinkin much!
I guess I‚Äôm a Mainer lol
That's just New England in general.
Be kind, but not necessarily nice.
Solid plan, signed, a Mainer.
Ahh the farmer fuckup.
Having just moved to Maine, this is very informative. Thank you. Now I know how to be lol
This is the way. 

 - A Vermonter living in Maine.
I was going to tell you that you‚Äôre wrong and we don‚Äôt do that up here but uhhhh yeah we do üòÇ
Kill them with kindness.
Yeah, it‚Äôs much nicer and they‚Äôll get some good photos to show their families.
I love this about New England, we note the scenic route when in most towns, it‚Äôs just the way.
That makes you an out of stater who should be living here.
Yes, the tens of thousands of people flooding into the state aren't interesting at all. Let's not talk about it.

Better yet, howsabout you scroll along? This is gonna be over soon, unlike the sandwich jokes.
I chuckled at this post and therefore it was worth posting :)
![gif](giphy|EKDIMDsRX3ihy)
Does all the positivity ITT make you feel like shit? Self reflect
Absolutely
Also a very New Yorker thing to do
Some passive, with light hits of aggressive lol
You did! Thank you so much from all of us in r/connecticut!
or, directions by Foogle
You big mad huh? 

Where did I say we shouldn‚Äôt be talking about tourists? The problem is that this state full of emotionally stunted/sheltered folks can only agree with one end of the spectrum or the other: either ‚Äúthese tourists are awful!‚Äù Or the slightly more nuanced ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna be nice to toursists and you should too!‚Äù

Like how about we just treat everyone with respect regardless of what their license plate says and talk about this awesome event rather than obsessing and bellyaching over the tourists sucking or being nice to the tourists. Like holy shit the fixation on the tourists from both sides is unhealthy af.
"How about this? We all just stop talking about the tourists..." 

"Where did I say we shouldn't be talking about tourists?" 

You're a special kind of guy, aren't you?
> How about this? We all just stop talking about the tourists

> Where did I say we shouldn‚Äôt be talking about tourists?

bud these were LESS than thirty minutes apart, maybe smoke less
Hey great job writing the exact same comment as someone else. Made you feel almost as special as me I bet

We absolutely SHOULD be talking about the tourists but since no one can handle it I suggest we just stop
The point is if you can‚Äôt talk about them without it causing you great emotional turmoil one way or another then maybe you should just avoid talking about them. We absolutely should be talking about the once in a lifetime event and the people visiting us but we shouldn‚Äôt make it such a goddamn thing that it isn‚Äôt.
I figured if I repeated the answer you might understand how stupid you sounded.
Hey my Taco brother. You may need a digital detox. Carrying the name of Taco is a heavy burden.
Stop. Dumping! 
We all complain about tourists and out of staters but if I see one more VT plate white pickup throw a twisted tea or beer can or McDonald's bag out their window I'm gonna LOSE IT. 

This is your state, your town, your local roads. I literally will never be able to understand the mentality that it's ok to just throw your trash out your window. How someone can do that and not feel like a total piece of shit is beyond me.

Keep your shit in your truck. Pull into your driveway. Pick up your trash and put it in your own damn trash can. Takes three fuckin seconds and you don't end up looking like a white trash loser. 


It‚Äôs always a twisted tea or mini bottle of fireball
A few seasons ago, I saw someone toss their cigarette on the ground in the Burke parking lot. Then I heard a BOOMING voice from a massive dude behind me, who said slowly, ‚Äúthe world is not your trash can.‚Äù The person realized they might get their ass kicked and picked it up and it was one of those chef‚Äôs kiss no notes moments.¬†
The number of times I and my buddy have had to clean up trashed primitive campsites in the Green Mountain National Forest is too damn high.

We used to find broken camping gear, bottles, plastic bags, etc.  Now we are seeing whole gutted camping trailers being abandoned.  The National Forest Rangers can't even keep up with removing everything that is being abandoned on public lands.  Disgusting that people think this is OK.
Ages ago, when I was a kid, my dad came across some hunters parked on the side of an old road. On the way back, they were gone but had left behind a mound of trash. 

He poked through it and found some mail with a home address on it.  He boxed it up and MAILED IT BACK TO THEM, along with a letter to the editor of their local newspaper.  

He was my hero that day.
When I was an obnoxious teenage girl walking with my pack, giggling, swerving, and acting foolish on the sidewalk, one of us threw a piece of garbage down. A man came running after us with the wrapper in his hand. We were mortified. It literally changed my view forever. We need to call out these assholes.
I live in a fairly rural area in Southern VT, and the sheer amount of people with VT tags just dumping tires and all sorts of shit in our little river is fucking infuriating. 

The local recycling center takes tires for $5 a pop. But apparently that's too expensive, and just polluting the local brook is a better alternative?

I'll also add onto the list - smokers. I don't care how insignificant one butt is, that shit fucking adds up. Just throw your damn butts away, it's not that hard! 

I really hate people sometimes.
Every single time they stop to get gas they are literally standing next to a garbage can. 

Literally.

Every single time.
I worked in a job in an agency where it was my job to clean up everything you were talking about. Everyone else who worked with me and all the people who did it worked incredibly hard. We were demon by local people and talk down to by our superiors. It‚Äôs almost like nobody wants to clean up this state. And yes, that is something you do on a daily basis clean where you live. Maybe it‚Äôs just that I don‚Äôt give a fuck attitude that every entitled person has to toss trash to the wind. And not have to pay to deal with her own garbage.
Love this thread.
Can we also talk about the end of cigarettes everywhere? The amount of them that pile up in common spaces is insane. The number of smokers who CHOOSE to litter them create a nasty reality.
[deleted]
Some of these littering folk want to get their buzz on before arriving home but feel the need to hide the evidence from those they live with.¬†
My brother-in-law said he knew who was driving the back roads near his house based on the brand of cans along the road.  You gotta get rid of the evidence immediately if you drinkin!-n-drivin!
I run dozens of miles a week on dirt back roads north of Montpelier. The litter is everywhere, and it‚Äôs constant. Beer & twisted tea cans hung on trees, dumped in the ditches, smashed into the road, whatever. Thought my neighbors were all alright but clearly there‚Äôre a few bad apples in the basket.
I own a good-sized wood lot out in the boondocks.  I refuse to post it because it's against my beliefs about "land ownership".  So I kind of like when hunters use the land.  

But the amount of trash I find (mostly empty cans of cheap booze) out in the middle of the woods is really sad.
[deleted]
I complained about this a few weeks ago. People will argue you and say it doesn‚Äôt happen/ doesn‚Äôt matter because we are already the cleanest state they‚Äôve visited. 1. They‚Äôve never been to Canada. 2. That doesn‚Äôt make it okay. 

Go on any walk and literally count the twisted Tea, white claw and ring ding wrappers. You‚Äôll lose count before 1/10th of a mile. It‚Äôs obvious that there‚Äôs one group of people doing it and they are also the ones who claim to enjoy nature the most. 
Why do hicks litter when you all claim to be huge outdoors people? Also why do hicks have the most girly taste in drinks? It‚Äôs funny to me that you guys are out there mudding and shooting guns and have to ask your buddy in your hick voice ‚Äúwant to pass me that grapefruit claw.‚Äù 

I have no problem with hicks and would probably be one if they classed it up just a few notches and cared about anything other than themselves and their pussy drinks.
Garbage people gonna make more garbage.  It‚Äôs science.
This happens every day on the road behind my house -- National Guard Ave/River Cove. We picked up a bunch a few weeks ago.
Lots of woods by the roads by me. So when garbage including lots of twisted trees cans-gets tossed,it stays there until we can fish it out of the brush. 
Trash throwing trash.
I live off a road where no tourists would have any reason to go unless they got lost.

We are *constantly* picking up twisted tea cans or fireball nips.

Remember this the next time we get a post about flatlanders.

There‚Äôs no right to litter because your white ancestor got here before someone else‚Äôs white ancestor.
White pickup driver here and I‚Äôm more of a heady topper guy
I can't believe people willingly throw trash like that. No values or parenting? If my mother had seen me throw an empty can out the car window she would've knocked the shit out of me, and rightly so.
Its always Twisted Tea. Why is it always Twisted Tea?
Definitely agree I had a ex that did this once I made her go back and pick it up. Definitely a nasty pig move.
That is when you wish you were driving a completely tough, POS truck, to sort it out. 

I am with you only complete ASSHOLES throw their trash out the window.  That includes flippin cigarettes!!! 

Makes you want to follow them home. Empty all neighbors trash can onto their lawn‚Ä¶.
When I lived in Vermont a VAST trail went through my property. Those assholes always left Twisted Tea cans everywhere.¬†
"white trash loser" - I think you probably hit upon the reason right there.
As an ex piece of shit alcoholic with 5 years sober off the sauce, I can confirm it's ppl throwing empties out of their car to avoid legal trouble. Can't get charged for an open container if there's no container. :(
I saw someone just open their door at an intersection to dump their McD‚Äôs trash. No shame. I hate these behaviors.
Next can we do people who pick up their dog poop on the trail and then leave the bag next to the trail? There's nothing more infuriating to me.
If you're looking for logic and reason out of some redneck drinking a twisted tea on his drive home from work, consider he's too busy worried about people treading on him. He's got the complexity of flags, Biden, hatred, climate denialism, and just general shitheadery to worry about. He cares not for your complaint. He's probably disappointed the can didn't hit your windshield.
 Also, scoop your dogs poop and then take the bag home! The bag won‚Äôt just teleport to the dog poop bin!
Near my parents‚Äô house there‚Äôs somebody who throws crown royal bottles out of his car. I‚Äôve probably found 20 of them on a half-mile stretch of dirt road. At one point the guy must‚Äôve gotten his license suspended because there was a pile of them in the woods‚Ä¶ a year later, though, he was back to his old shenanigans. Alcoholism is wild
Lamoille county is bad
I was wondering if Twisted Tea is the most littered can in VT or if it is just more noticeable because it is yellow.
I regularly pick up litter at Shelburne Pond where a lot of Vermont trucks go for the fishing access. They are THE WORST. Just last week I picked up about 3 dozen cigarette butts in one spot where someone had clearly just dumped out their ash tray in the middle of the parking lot. So many cigarette butts, disposable vape thingies, cans, bottles, tons of tangled fishing line, lure packaging, broken lures, Slim Jim wrappers, take out containers.... they're fucking disgusting. I can't believe how much litter accumulates in such a tiny parking lot.
Thank you it‚Äôs way more locals than tourists littering!!!! Glad a fellow Vermonter can finally see and admit that!!!! I get so sick and tired of locals blaming tourists and out of state transplants for everything when it‚Äôs their neighbors 9 times out of 10..
I learned on VT Green-up Day that there's a local alcoholic who loves his big can of Fosters on the way home. I picked up at least 50 of them in a stretch of 150 yards!
You'd think with the property tax hike we'd at least get municipal trash removal for it.
You think losers drinking and driving care about littering? 

Those good ol boys enjoy how big of a pile they can make. They usually throw it out of the window at the same spots, hence piles of big light piss here and a cluster of twisted iced tea over there.
The park and ride by the catamount club in Williston would like a word. Feel like I drive by there daily to see a new stack of tires regularly
I lost it once, and the person followed me, then reported me for making ‚Äúracial comments‚Äù, which I didn‚Äôt, I just said to pick up after themselves, we were all white. people will do messed up things if you call them out on littering.
Hasn‚Äôt been active for a while, but you‚Äôll enjoy the Instagram @budriververmont.
Jokes on you these losers don‚Äôt give a fuck about literally anything
Can we start a coalition to get a $1 bottle and can deposit? A lot of the litter would magically go away if it were more then 5 cents!
I would love to see a poll of every county tallying the most prevalent can. In Windsor it‚Äôs a close call between twisted tea and bud light, but twisted probably edges out the lead.
Vermont. My home. Where people from there come here and then try to make here like there.
Dirtbag
White pickups are gonna be like that in every state‚Ä¶ they also think the own the road‚Ä¶ I know it sounds ridiculous. But it‚Äôs true. 5 years, and over 500,000 miles on the road, these are the guys most likely to be a holes
Problem is there are a lot of white trash losers in Vermont. And unfortunately all the twisted tea cans that you see on the roadway, and are actively thrown out of cars... Are by white trash losers that live in the state of Vermont. You are never going to change their mind. I wish we could change their minds, I really do.
Unpopular opinion: Abolish Greenup Day. In my rural community, in the months/weeks leading up to Greenup, the sides of our roads start looking like a landfill. People chuck appliances, toilets, all manner of trash because they KNOW it's going to be picked up.
If they tolerate it at the swim hole, imagine what the inside of their homes must look like!
A lot of it is dumbass pickup drivers who leave trash in the bed, and don't know how wind works.
Something about big pickup trucks attracts the wrong kind of people.

Well that's a nickle pick them up and return them. Free money in your pocket.
"Just giving other people something to do on earth day"

Said by random old dude when I confronted them about throwing trash out their window..
Amen!!
So many here I see dig holes and burry truck loads of it or illegally burning it. It‚Äôs heart breaking. Hearing the ‚Äúit‚Äôs below the soil so it won‚Äôt hurt anything‚Äù and ‚Äúit‚Äôs just a little bit of burning. It won‚Äôt hurt anything.‚Äù
Just because you‚Äôre trash, doesn‚Äôt mean I have to accept it. There should be more signs for dumping fines.
It's everywhere, Maine is bad as well. I walk the dog on a very rural road and take a garbage bag with me. I pick stuff up everyday.  Beer cans, fast food bags, fast food Styrofoam containers, people are disgusting..
Stop.  Bitching!  

We all complain about tourists and out of staters and our neighbors.  That's a shitty way to make ourselves feel better.   And why I quit reddit.  Come on, people.  Please stop worrying about what your neighbor and tourists are doing and put that energy into stopping the systemic polluters of our state and country.  A bunch of twisted teas and butts by the roadside don't compare to the poisons we turn a blind eye to in our families, communities, states and country.
When I used to live near a public beach, it was out of state road bikers who were the most vial litter bugs The worst and most memorable litter I witnessed was a pair of underwear covered in feces with a bag of McDonald‚Äôs with it. 

One thing people fail to realize is that poor people don‚Äôt have a fancy trash service to pick up their trash every week. That means they have to bring the trash to the dump, which might not be affordable. That‚Äôs why you see disgusting mattresses and bags of trash dumped on my road. There‚Äôs a trailer park close by and a lot of people living in tight quarters and poverty. I have made it known to everyone in the park that if they need help hauling or paying for trash removal, to call me up. I would rather come help then look at a disgusting mattress for weeks before town road crew gets harassed into finally dealing with it. 

The beers cans is an obvious reason. They do not want to get a DUI. So they throw the can out the window so they don‚Äôt get an open container violation.  They know someone will eventually pick it up anyway. Not saying it‚Äôs right, but the reason people litter is more nuanced than just being inconsiderate or bad people.
There was a legislator who proposed a bill to ban the foam cigarette filters since so many smokers are inconsiderate and suck and toss their butts to the curb whether walking or driving. The bill never never gained traction, but I thought it was a great idea. At least the rest of the cigarette is essentially biodegradable for when smokers continue to toss them.
Burlington is by far the worst area for littering. It's like a 600 yard trash can on the interstate alone when you're driving by. To be fair they're busy dealing with a debilitating drug problem so maybe environmentalism has taken a back burner up there
Used to be BudLight, now it's Twisted Tea. The change seemed to happen right after the Right-wing freakout over that Mulvaney can, so I guess we know who's doing it.
People don‚Äôt want empties in the car if they get pulled over. Obviously not justifying it but that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening
It's disgusting. Any good Vermonter knows you wait to litter till you're on the New York side of the lake!
All I had to see was pickup and can exactly picture the driver. I‚Äôm not putting every pickup driver in that category, but there‚Äôs a certain type of person who does that, and they pretty much always drive pickups, or at least some crappy American branded beater car‚Ä¶
People that drive white pickups know that they‚Äôre fucked up dick heads
Yeah because out of state people are gonna be reading Vermont Reddit lol
I hear you all, but you know...just to be a devil's advocate, cigarette butts are biodegradable. I'm not a Smoker (anymore), so don't yell at me...I'm a chemist.
Just a good guess, here. There are probably plenty of people who would (rightly or wrongly) point out that they have the right to litter. To toss trash and old tires into roadside ditches. To let their fast food bags haunt the roadside. And so forth.
Yes! And why those in particular?!! actually love a twisted tea but after picking up probably 20,000 of them from my side yard and ditch over the past couple of years I've lost my appetite for them
I always wondered if I just see more twisted teas cans because they are yellow but after attending several green up days over the years, I am confident in saying it is the official drink of VT litterers.
I just picked up 3 BL cans and 2 Foster's oilcans on my walk around the pond.   Not to mention the half dozen plastic UTZ pretzel size jars full of spent pickles someone dumped at edge of our property.   It's always a local throwing shit and dumping.
Fireball is a favorite of most Jerry‚Äôs to give them the courage to send it.

I've noticed the mini Fireball litter everywhere. I had no idea they sold so many until I started seeing them on the ground next to basically any road I've stood next to.
Love that. I have a lot of respect for people who aren't afraid to speak up on their principles like that
I really hate the way smokers just casually toss their butts as if they aren‚Äôt littering. I‚Äôve ‚Äúreturned‚Äù a few to sender over the years, but that wasn‚Äôt me (although it makes me happy to hear others are doing the same thing). I work at my local mountain which has a no smoking policy at the resort (they are allowed in the lot) and I‚Äôm always polite with the reminders to throw their butts away but still I always find a bunch. Scattered in the lot. If it looks fresh, it then gets put up under the windshield wiper.
I never thought much of it before I quit, always assumed they were biodegradable since they're tossed so much but saw something like over 2 billion butts are tossed on the ground per year and the effect they have. Ever since I was OCD about it, got alot of strange looks. "You really think your few butts a day will make a difference?", was something I often heard. 

It really wasn't hard to not litter
But what kind of vehicle was it tossed from? 
Cause I drive a white pickup and I‚Äôm MASSIVELY triggered rn
I was up Mt Tabor last weekend and there multiple literal pianos dumped on the side of the road in a national forest

This is fantastic!
üëè proof that this works! All it takes is one "oh shit, I fucked up and everybody knows" moment to potentially change someone's behavior.
Smoker here! Nothing irritates me more than sering butts all over the place. Its not hard to find a trash can. If a smoker is hiking, you bring a receptacle with you. Pack it in, pack it out *always*
Infuriating. I always want to blame out of staters but the people I see leaving their wrappers, butts, and dirty diapers down by my local river swimming spot are all from town. They grew up here and apparently don't give a shit about keeping the places THEY RECREATE in clean.
Us too. So much trash pushed down into the West River. But at least we haven't found big piles of human poop this summer.
Sounds like it's time to set up a well hidden trail camera to catch these people in the act and start shaming them publicly. They'll probably get a nice fine from it too.
If you can afford the new tires or couch, then you can DEFINITELY afford to properly dispose of the old ones. (You is plural. Not singling you out.)
Wouldn‚Äôt be Bull creek by chance? I‚Äôm pretty sick of pulling tires out the creek that runs through my property.
There is Green-Up day. Tons collected by volunteers.¬†
My favorite thing is the people who are so fucking cheap that they take their shit to the corner and put a free sign on it instead of where it needs to go the fucking dump you cheap ass motherfuckers!
I‚Äôll never forget a ride somewhere up in the NEK with a couple miles absolutely littered with the same small boxed wine cartons. I felt obviously disgusted but also kind of sorry for that person.
I'd like to argue that stoners and those who throw beer out of the window are two different groups of people. With some overlap..
Most people post their land because of all of the littering.
Agree, unfortunately. That's why we need to tell them they're acting like fools to their face, get a little bit of that social shame going.
Difference between "outdoors people" who just use the outdoors and those who also appreciate it.
I saw a sticker, ‚ÄúOnly trash litters‚Äù
Set up a trail cam
The only thing worse than flatlanders. Alcoholics.
Classin it up! And... You don't litter.... Right?
You don't see nearly as many "fancier" cans on the side of the road... gives you an idea of the caliber of folks drinking swill.
Knew someone who would get fast food, bag up all their trash in the bag from the meal, and then promptly chuck it out the window. I lost it the first time I watched it happen & then I was made out to seem like some hysterical eco nut but why on earth could you not just save the bag to throw out at the next place you stop? They said their family always did it that way and it didn‚Äôt matter.
Bud Light
I seriously fantasize about dumping all their trash back on their front lawn, making a pile the size of their house that engulfs their front door
That honestly makes sense. I'm sorry you had a hard time and great job on your 5 year sobriety!!
Trail? They do that at the park within 50 feet of the trash can in my town.
This made me laugh üòÇ fair point
Littering is the easiest way to "own the libs," don'tcha know.
When you can't face the family that you live with sober. Maybe you need some therapy. Or go back to being single.
It‚Äôs a common drink driving drink because of the smell.
> You'd think with the property tax hike we'd at least get municipal trash removal for it.

The property tax increases are almost 100% due to education spending.  This makes me think ... perhaps our school buses could be combined with dump trucks.  

Have the schools pickup my garbage along with my kids.  (at the end of the day, return the kids, not the garbage.)
Dude, I wish. Do you think that mentality is part of what's contributing to the littering? "I don't want to fill up my can at home because I don't want to go to the town dump/don't want to pay for a trash service"? Just curious. I don't like driving to the dump either but I do it because that's just part of life in the country. If people want an easy life where they are catered to they can pack up and move to a city
Vermont would go bankrupt from all the out-of-state cans returned to Vermont.
Orange Co-Bud Light
Lots of the white pickups tend to be carpenters/contractors in my area.
Burlington did something this past year where they had a collection area for dumped items to avoid sidewalks getting all clogged up. Apparently that worked. Maybe communities need to offer a yearly "free dump your shit"... I know that's probably wicked expensive though
It's going to get dumped anyhow.
Idk man sounds like we're bitching together here!
[removed]
Nah, tons of nice people have white pick up trucks. My dad does and he wouldn't hurt a fly (or litter). It's just a shitty stereotype I accidentally perpetuated with my angry rant.
You new here?
'Cigarette butts are not biodegradable because they contain non-biodegradable cellulose acetate plastic fibers.¬†While they can break down over time depending on environmental conditions, like the sun and rain, it can take up to 15 years for them to decompose.¬†In fact, a study found that a cigarette butt was only 38% decomposed after two years.'
> cigarette butts are biodegradable

not over time scales that matter

I'm gonna pick up smoking and dump all my butts on your lawn and see how you feel about it.
Don't chemicals from the butts and filters (if filtered) leach into the soil? Yeah, I know.... minimal impact from just a few discards... but often, they accumulate into quite a pile when many people drop them in the same spot.   
  
What happens if birds or animals eat them? 

Those are sincere questions. Not snark. 

Cigarettes may not be a massive pollution issue as far as the longevity of the thing itself (the cigarette butt) but there is still an impact. 

For me, an additional issue is the psychological orientation of people who pollute, period. I mean... to me, from that standpoint, it doesn't matter what the item is. Dumping one's crap along public roadways, in public waterways, just anywhere they damn please is a shitty take on being a human/member of society.  

Anyway.
what the fuck are you talking about
It‚Äôs the freedom crowd, I‚Äôm sure.
Cheap way to drink on the way home from the job site without your wife smelling alcohol on your breath
Choice drinks of alcoholics and drunk drivers.
It's a cheap and easy way to get loaded.
You're not supposed to drink the ones you pick up from your side yard and ditch. No wonder you've lost your appetite for them.
Honestly? I‚Äôd bet it‚Äôs because you can buy both of those at the grocery store or gas station. Going to the actual liquor store before it closes requires some strategy and organization, apparently like figuring out how and where to throw away your garbage properly. Ugh.
A lot of gas stations have started selling mini fireball and mcgillicuddy‚Äôs at the register.
fosters oil cans lol brings back memories!! (not of dumping them on your property)
Easy to put down. Smells like cinnamon...decent kick and its CHEAP.  I see all sorts of weird random cans on the side of the road from the white trash that lives down the road.  We are on a dead-end back road, so it's pretty obvious who it is.
My mother used to knock on their window and throw the cigarette back into their car.
In between quittings I smoked one winter outside the house only and threw the butts in the snow bank and where ever.  Come spring I had to pick up every single one of them. Made me quit for good.
My first step towards quitting was quitting smoking in my car. Primarily because I had my car detailed, I guess, but also because I decided to never throw my butts on the ground again. 

It‚Äôs been like 20 years since I last smoked a cigarette in a car, but maaan, the urge is still there every time I close the door.
Damn.  A shame too because there can be some good wood to reclaim from a piano, especially the older pianos.
Field dress your smokes!
5oz energy thingies are really air tight. Great for stowing your butts in your pocket without getting stinky.
Yep, I carry one of those Rescue Remedy tins to keep my butts in when I'm out in the woods or anywhere where I'm unlikely to find a trash can. And if I forget it, my butts either go in my pocket or in my bag. It's not that hard...
I take the paper off when I‚Äôm done with my butt and throw the filter in the trash
[deleted]
"Excuse me, you dropped your (trash item)."

Give them a chance to realize they were seen and a way out "oh, I didn't notice, thanks"

Then lay it on
Can‚Äôt reason with alcoholics üòï
Yeah I could, but I‚Äôm too busy to police this.
Must be the only guy in a white pickup who doesn‚Äôt. 

It‚Äôs ok, I‚Äôve been subjected to just about every stereotype there is for a white middle aged male contractor in a pickup truck
I agree, but pickup trucks are expensive!
People have no sense of right and wrong anymore :(

People have really become so self absorbed that they don‚Äôt even consider the consequences.
It's all good I'm funnier and more aware for having gone thru all of that, if anything.
Lol on my ride home today some dude in front of me threw a diet coke can out the window...now that, I can't explain, aside from just absolute disregard for anything besides one's own desires.
At least at the park there's a reason to pick it up in the first place. Not that it's okay to not throw it away, but I don't even understand the mentality of picking up dog shit in the middle of the woods and then putting it back down in the woods in a plastic bag where it can stay forever. I don't even clean up my dogs poo in the bushes at my own house. It makes more sense to let it do what it does than putting it in a plastic bag to sit in a landfill for the next 100 years
The tax hike is almost entirely driven by the cost of health insurance for teachers. It‚Äôs one giant advertisement for universal healthcare.
No. It‚Äôs mostly shitty alcoholics who don‚Äôt want the evidence of their DUI in the car.
It's part of it.  Maybe not casual littering but that's certainly why every pulloff has couches and mattresses down over the bank.
With weekly trash pick up, you get morons leaving their trash outside all week so a bear or other animal can sift through.
Or constant, not just annually.¬†

Read my other reply.  Not a butt dumper...just making a factual point...cans are worse.
Yeah, I hear you and agree.  When I was a smoker, I carried around one of those weed ziplocs to put my butts in.  It's just that I've been in acetate tow manufacturing facilities and seen how it's made.  It's basically wood bark.  It would be interesting to compare the biodegradation of a cigarette butt next to a stick and see if there is any difference.

EDIT: All I was really saying is that cans and shit are way worse.
Yeah there's a real specific brand of person who consistently puts their personal liberties and convenience over public good and well being
Oh damn didn't consider that. Sir here has the inside scoop üòÖ
And tossing the alcohol bottle removes some of the evidence of the DUI that is owed.
> on the way home from the job site

only on the way home, for sure.
This is why I assume 2/3 at least are twisted tea.
so gross.
Not just your wife, but also if you get pulled over on the way home...
Easy to chug with no bubbles too.
Thanks for the chuckle!
Yeah they looked like antiques or at least old

News flash. If you're smoking the whole of you is already "stinky". 

Why not just put it back into the package it came out of?

To be clear, you're against the idea of teachers getting free healthcare?
Ah, ok, that actually makes sense and it's not something I had considered...
Even in places with municipal trash removal, those are usually an extra charge (so you still see it in those places as well).

Addiction is a bitch
Bookmarked so I know where to go find a piano.
Crush them dead out and pack out the butts. It‚Äôs not hard.
That's not what they said at all...
Well, you said you were going to dump butts on my lawn, so that made it personal.
yep. 

I've been off the sauce for a few years... well like 8... I never liked twisted teas, so gross.
That's why I started with 'To be clear" and ended with a question mark. I wasn't sure if that's what they were saying, so I asked for clarification.
Congrats! Proud of you :)
They're saying it's an inadvertent advertisement for Universal Healthcare, cause if everyone just already had healthcare this wouldn't be an issue and the tax hike most likely would not happen.
To whom it may concern. The Aurora in Vermont.
First time I‚Äôve ever had the opportunity seeing such a beautiful sight. It really is amazing.

Damn, I missed it! Anyone still seeing it? I'm in South Burlington and maaaaybe see a faint greenish glow in the north? But I'm probably imagining it.
Any idea if we‚Äôre supposed to be seeing them again tonight? Unfortunately I fell asleep at 8 last night and missed it

Saw the sky being vaugely pink, but we had too much cloud cover where I was last night to see them

That sounds incredible. I remember the first time I saw the Northern Lights too. It felt like magic watching those colors dance across the sky. Vermont's beauty can be so breathtaking, especially when you catch moments like that. Thanks for sharing your experience. It‚Äôs always nice to connect with others who appreciate the wonders around us.
Yeah we have clouds here across the river. Fuck you Vermont.
So I actually almost booked a trip to Iceland this year to try to see them. I‚Äôm in Burlington and while it looks pretty cool on my phone, irl it just looks grey and slightly bright. Literally thought it was clouds until I put my camera up. Was that similar to how you‚Äôve seen them elsewhere? I always imagined you actually see all the colors and such. I can see maybe a tinge of green but it‚Äôs more grey than anything.
Amazing!
Awesome photo and view!

It‚Äôs defiantly trip holding up your phone and seeing all the colors so much more intense. This was taken in Saxtons river about 30 minutes ago before all the clouds rolled back in
Damn. I just drove out to Colchester nearly an hour ago. It looked slightly pink to me, but I thought it was too cloudy to see anything. I drove through Winooski, Burlington, and South Burlington. Only saw a slight hint of pink, maybe. 

Damn clouds. Maybe I'll try again soon. Those pictures look great.
Holy heck! This way to the emerald city!!!!!!!!

I also see a greenish/blueish hue to the north. Usually Montreal‚Äôs lights are brown/beige.
I second this I must know. I had read about it in the morning then fucking forgot, saw this post and am now so fucking mad at myself
same here, I could have sworn we had extremely low chances of seeing it here so I didn't even think to look and see ;o;

I'm wondering the same thing. This is what my camera was able to get before cloud cover came, and it definitely wasn't that bright in person. It looked more like blue hour. But this was farther south than you.

I was hoping to see angels descend from the sky, but maybe you and I just got unlucky, angle-wise.
When I first went out I had to use my camera to really see it (which is a trick I picked up on a tour in Iceland). 

Then something happened, either our eyes adjusted or the storm intensified, or both and we could easily see it with our naked eye. With just our eyes we could see several distinct colors and watch it move around. It took up almost the entire sky. 

It was honestly one of the most awe-inspiring things I‚Äôve ever seen in my life. Easily up there with the eclipse.
No it can be much different! Last night was amazing but when we saw them in Iceland they were very bright green, fully visible to the naked eye and swirling. We have been to other places north of and near the arctic circle during the correct time of year and haven‚Äôt seen them though, so try not to only go for auroras. Iceland has plenty to offer on its own if you don‚Äôt see them anyway
Depends what time. Around 1 it was moving and pulsing a lot
I‚Äôm in Burlington but drove out of town to see them last night. You need to get away from light pollution to see the colours. It was fully pink and green visible to the naked eye last night once I got to a darker area. I used to live in Alaska and saw them regularly. It is the same there. You have to get away from light pollution to see them. Also the less moon in the sky, the more visible.
I saw them in Iceland the same way I saw them here in Vt last night, through my camera lens. Have not been able to see them with the naked eye, yet.
That was my experience seeing them in Alaska. Still impressive but mostly grey. It seems some people's eyes are more sensitive to it and will see more color. But digital cameras definitely pick up more than "real life".
Saxtons river?!? That means i probably could have seen it in bratt! Of freaking course i missed it lol miss this and the eclipse. Is there a chance again tonight? Beautiful pictures by the way!!
Interesting!! Tysm
Yes, it‚Äôs supposed to be happen again tonight though last night was peak intensity

I was literally standing next to those salad bowls putting together meals for people who were on the other side of the river and somehow completely missed him being there. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è (I did hear he was there, just didn‚Äôt see him‚Ä¶)
Bernie for President... üò≠
Always the man of the people.
I love that we can all just spot him being his Vermonty self and walking around. Saw him on church street in Burlington a few years ago with an aide and they were just chatting with their leftover lunch. Just such a normal dude
If you had knelt to take that picture it would have been 100x more epic. lol

I love the man. One of the very few honest and consistent politicians in my lifetime.
Certainties in life:

Rain is wet

You can‚Äôt avoid death and taxes

Bernie always was and always will be a man of and for the people
Look at those melons!
Welch showed up earlier, too.
I remember the first time I met the guy. My father had cornered him in the Putney general store back in the 90‚Äôs when I was little and was haranguing him on some bit of policy and Bernie just stood there and listened to my father and engaged with him man to man, not powerful political rep to peasant or something. That doesn‚Äôt even begin to get into how well he treated the Vermont troops at the capitol after Jan6. Treated them like equals and went out of his way to help them with whatever they needed (my brother deployed down there) 


I don‚Äôt agree with some of his takes but the man is  straight up honest and cares deeply about this state. We will be so much the poorer when time catches up with him. 


Now bring it on maga trolls. Your tears and cope responses sustain me.
Good.  Glad he was there to see first hand and offer empathy and support.
Love me some Bernie!  What a mensch!
Me at my job; ‚ÄòHey there! Picking up? Last name-OH F**- hi sir let me get that for you..‚Äô 

Told him how I won a reading competition in elementary school and won a trip to go bowling with him. Obv didn‚Äôt remember *me* but knew it was *insert my school* :‚Äô) sweet man, has remembered my name and asked for me when he‚Äôs came into my establishment ever since :‚Äô)
[removed]
How big of him
He should learn to stand up straight.
i love bernie so much
Our king
Did you ask Bernie what he did with all the Veterans money in Vermont - we are still waiting from 2012
Bernie spoke at my high school in Summit, IL (just west of Chicago) in 2016 & I worked on his campaign that year & in 2020. News¬† confirmed what I always suspected: DNC railroaded Bernie in 2020 because the Wall Street donors didn't like his policies. To be fair, I'm a little down on Bernie ATM because he said what Isn't-real is doing to Palestinians isn't a genocide. Anyway, in a trip to Vermont this week, love this state.¬†
Commie!
That sounds like such a special moment. It's amazing to see local leaders connecting with the community like that. I remember when I met a politician at a local event, and it really made me feel more connected to the issues affecting us. It‚Äôs great to see those moments of joy and hope in our communities. Thanks for sharing this experience. It‚Äôs inspiring to hear about the positive energy around us.
I like Bernie quite a bit, but struggle to find where he and Leahy have been effective. Vermont education is not so good and people, almost everyone I at least, know really struggle.
Can we just write him in? If everyone writes him in that would be awesome üëçüòé
[removed]
Tell him it‚Äôs time to retire
Is he using any of his millions of dollars to help? Or was it just for support/press?¬†
I feel  sorry  for Plainfield
Gross
Not sure why people like Bernie. He hasn‚Äôt really done anything to help this state out in the 1000 years he‚Äôs been in politics. If he really wanted to help, he‚Äôd talk to these a-holes raising our taxes by 14% this year and nearly 30% next year even though people can barely afford food
Man had a USSR flag in his office when he was mayor of Burlington, took his honey moon to USSR as well and were cheering on communism now. Traitors to this country.
You sure it wasn't just a crotchy old man? Cuz that's what it looks like
Commie‚Äî‚Äî
Thats Bernie in a nutshell
My friends dad once spent a 6hr flight next to him and they talked the entire time
Hah! Had the same thing happen to me coming back from Detroit once. I watched the little air nozzle blow his white hair around for a few minutes.
man of honor
We could have had him for 2 terms, but no, we can‚Äôt have nice things
Huge regret for me is not getting pictures with him when he showed up for the Strolling of the Heifers and Brattleboro‚Äôs Fourth of July parades.
Indeed it is. You can see videos from Vermont Public filmed yesterday of him and Welch walking Plainfield. I did not see Welch, but he was in town at some point.
Cue the flatlander‚Ä¶ Bernie is around everywhere here‚Ä¶ it isn‚Äôt crazy to see him around or take a selfie with him. I have one with him from 12 years ago..
Well that‚Äôs because what you‚Äôre seeing problems with and what you‚Äôre mentioning is the responsibility of a state senator and legislature, not our DC reps.
Yeah don't do that.  Normally I would support that. But the opposing party is pretty scary.

Good point, he might lose a tough race if he doesn‚Äôt pander.

/s Since you must be brand new.
Yeah he probably will do something like that. As an example a few years ago his inauguration meme photo merch raised $1.8 million for various charities. He along side other Vermont‚Äôs reps were also very involved with ensuring FEMA funding/ action was expedited after last years flood. He‚Äôs very good at giving back where he can and is in touch with needs of Vermonters whether those Vermonters want to realize that or not.  No politician can be perfect, but out of all politicians he‚Äôs the one I‚Äôve had, by far, the least problem voting for.
He pays taxes and is willing to pay more in taxes. What is your point?
He's probably not the wealthiest person in that picture
A quick google would tell you how wrong you are. 

Bernie is also not in charge of state politics, if you want that to change vote for different state reps and govs. He fights for us at the national level.
You realize he was exploring a relationship as a sister city to burlington in a time when the us was attempting to expand its relationship with the Soviet union and not on his honeymoon right?
ZOMG Communism Socialism Marxism Stalinism Leninism Bolshevism Menshevikism!
Cool! Now do Trump!
Mother fucker like 5 or 6 US republican congressmen went to bend the knee to Putin on July fucking 4th not a few years ago. Fucking please.
And he was in Plainfield today surveying the damage, talking to the people there and *will* take their stories and needs to DC and is in a position to help get VT much needed $$$ from the federal government to help people clean up and rebuild. So you can be hung up on the Cold War (seriously, the fucking Cold War!!) all you want, but the guy works at helping Vermonters and that is his job right now.¬†
Wait, do we pledge allegiance to our capitalist ruling class now?
You would be LUCKY to become old enough to be a 'crotchety old man'
The day your grandpa is one of 60 people voting on my civil liberties I‚Äôll think you‚Äôre funny
https://time.com/5422714/what-is-democratic-socialism/
Your friends dad is so fucking lucky. I wish I could listen to Bernie discuss things in that setting
A real mensch!
I truly believe he would have beat Trump in 2016. The DNC really screwed him and worked to make sure Hilarie got the nomination

*edit* The DNC really screwed all of us, the country and arguably the world.
100% agree. He is what a senator should be like. He‚Äôs not wealthy and he is with the people. He‚Äôs popular but not a pompous baboon to people.
That‚Äôs because both the DNC and GOP are in-run by the neocon imperialists‚Ä¶
That fema funding were 2/3s went to admin costs? He‚Äôs not that good at giving back if he has amassed more wealth then he will ever be able to use or need. I love the idea of Bernie but the reality is he is just another lifelong millionaire politician. Is there a group collectively that is more to blame for where we are currently at?¬†
That he doesn‚Äôt really give a shit anymore. He shot his shot and now he is part of the establishment.¬†
I count ten. Which one or ones do you think are wealthier?¬†
It‚Äôs the end of the world as we know it‚Ä¶
This comment is lightning in a bottle, you made my weekend
Cool and those congressmen should be thrown out of office and out of politics just like Bernie.
Why do you feel the need to lie?
My grandparents are dead.   Even if they weren't, they should have been disqualified from such an important position. 

What's the percentage of Congress that has the "walking farts"?
Oh absolutely he would won. His policies were the antidote to all the factors that are driving the rise in the far right. The pickle we‚Äôre in now with Biden is a direct result of Democrats rejecting Bernie and his policies. I‚Äôll vote for Biden‚Äôs dead corpse to stop Trump, but I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm happy with Democrats for putting us in this position.
That‚Äôs because they are in the pockets of the imperialist neocons, Hilary is arguably a neocon, as is her husband, and other democrats like Joe Biden, Victoria Nuland, etc... They may claim she isn‚Äôt/they aren‚Äôt, but judging by her track record of voting yes for wars and pushing American imperial hegemony she definitely is‚Ä¶ same with Biden, he appointed Victoria Nuland as the acting deputy Secretary of State. The 2014 coup in Ukraine is her fault, where she used literal Nazi‚Äôs (Right Sector/Svaboda, C14) to overthrow Ukraine‚Äôs government. Look up the ‚ÄúF the EU‚Äù phone call leak between her and Geoffrey Piatt‚Ä¶ neocons used to be republicans. Not anymore‚Ä¶
Did you just say Bernie Sanders was not wealthy?
disagree, Bernie only appears for Vermonters when it‚Äôs convenient for him.  he‚Äôs as bad as all the others.
But Russia is capitalist now so it's ok lol
Oh the only lying involved in that scenario is their lame ass cover story of why the fuck they were in Moscow on the 4th of fucking July.
He could've won with the popular vote, but I think that the electoral college would have prevented him from getting in.
Sure he has some money. A quick google says net worth of ~$3M, which is honestly not all that much these days. He wrote a book and it sold well. He has the net worth of a reasonably successful doctor, or other skilled professional. Literally orders of magnitude less than the billionaires he rails about, and he made it through his own work, not leeching off others. 

Bernie achieved the American dream of moderate success that gives him a comfortable life by dedicating his life‚Äôs work to helping the rest of us. Nobody should begrudge him for that.
Compared to many career politicians, no. He really only got significant wealth after he wrote a book
He is fairly wealthy, but who are you voting for? Because a lot of people like to complain about bernies 3m. When meanwhile they vote for Trump. Or other political dynasties. 

Truth Is compared to most politicians he isn't that wealthy. But you do have to have some wealth to be a national level politician. Personally I think this is something we should change and I don't necessarily think Bernie would be against that.
What a remarkably dumb thing to type out and hit send on
Sure if you compare him the the big dogs in politics, however he is still in the 1%. However the comment I replied to said "He's not wealthy" that is not true.
Honestly I'm voting for Trump because I believe he is better for America and for our economy. We need to get back to trying to become more self sufficient as a country.
just speaking from experience.  
glad that hasn‚Äôt been yours.
What do you think the 1% is? I didn't know so I looked, Bernie has a net worth of 3 million: https://www.thestreet.com/lifestyle/bernie-sanders-net-worth-14678955

And the 1% appears to be 33 million:
https://www.bankrate.com/investing/income-wealth-top-1-percent/#:~:text=As%20of%20the%20second%20quarter,of%20more%20than%20%241.52%20billion.

Disclaimer: I took the first two websites to give me relatively recent numbers for both, you may find other sources
I mean, compared to pretty much every other Senator, he‚Äôs downright poor.
He‚Äôs literally the poorest member of the senate and he does not come from generational wealth, so don‚Äôt be a troll.
not even close to the 1%.  look up the 1% to see how much money those people actually have. the numbers are staggering.
You actually need almost $6M to get to the 1%
A /net worth/ of $3m at his age is ‚Ä¶ not really "wealthy", no.

If Trump kicks out all the undocumented immigrants like he says he will, construction and farming costs will go through the roof, and inflation will be much much worse.
[deleted]
Bernie is in fact the poorest member of the Senate.
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/15/us/politics/bernie-sanders-taxes.html
If you make $652,657 a year you qualify for the 1%, idk where you got your stats from

It has changed my bad,

*According to the Economic Policy Institute, the average annual wage of the top 1% was $819,324 as of 2021*
I enjoyed it when things were more affordable and America was getting it's own oil
Make a good faith effort to follow [Reddiquette](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439-Reddiquette).
I made $50k per year and I didn't get more than $5 in my paycheck from Trump's tax "cut."  It was only a cut if you make more than $80k.  I really tried to figure out my effective tax rate, not just withholding, calculated the whole thing out and there was honestly almost no savings.  Certainly not $100.   If a 3% tax cut saved you $100, you would have to make $4000 per pay check, which every two weeks is only like $100k, but that's ASSUMING you don't get any back, because if you do, you have to subtract to get your actual effective tax rate.  That's why mine was almost zero.
The context was wealth, not income. I don't know what Bernie's annual income is.
Making close to 1 mil annual I think it takes almost no time to save up 6 mil
Like it did under Obama. If only some jackass from NY hadn't fueled white fragility with some birth certificate nonsense, we might have had an intact pandemic task force, a flatter curve, and less dramatic inflation.
Things got way more expensive under Trump and continued (probably still continue) to get more expensive as a result of his administration‚Äôs policies and legislation enacted during his term as the worst president ever. 

You remember what happened to the housing market because interest rates were held artificially low?

You remember how he ‚Äúsaved American oil companies‚Äù by ‚Äúconvincing‚Äù Russia and OPEC to cut production and boost global oil prices?

You remember the price increases we saw on tons of consumer goods as a result of tariffs on Chinese imports?

You‚Äôve been falsely convinced that Trump is good for the American economy. He‚Äôs not. He‚Äôs good for the ultra rich. Not regular people. Like you. 

He‚Äôs a fraudster and a sleaze.
Nonsense.  We produce more crude oil than any other country.  We import more than we export, but that's because "Most U.S. crude oil imports take place when it is more profitable for U.S. refiners to process discounted heavier grades because those refineries have already invested in the additional complexity required to refine them."

Our dependence on oil is sickening & so are the humongous profits that greedy oil companies make.  How about investing some of their profits into renewables or figuring out what to do with all the plastics they contribute towards.  Just typing this pisses me off.  Complain to corporations, currently luxuriating in profits, about increased prices run-amok.

Minimum 7 years years without expenses, so over 10 years?

Almost no time...
I wasn't a fan of Obama, especially when he droned bombed an American citizen and blamed the father of the child instead of taking responsibility for killing an American child. 

However Obama would have been better than Biden. If Obama was in office he probably would've done the same thing as Biden in terms of trying to stop drilling, fracking, etc on American soil. 

The pandemic was an issue because the government used fear porn to try and scare everyone. It's pretty evident that covid was nowhere near as bad as they first claimed. If states didn't shut down and allowed people to work and do what they needed we would be in a better position. 

Inflation is do to Biden and his policies not Trump.
That checks out, thanks üòä
Please stop being a d*ck to visitors to our state
I mean, look at all the comments on the eclipse posts, or really any post where someone from outside our state dares to come and visit. What happened to "if you can't say anything nice..."?

Those of you who are unwelcoming and rude on this forum are giving VT a bad name, and I would request (as a fellow Vermonter) that you stop that shit.

People are getting shouted down for asking questions about how to best come and enjoy our state and spend money here.
>What happened to "if you can't say anything nice..."?

Sir, this is ~~a Wendy's~~ Reddit.
Also, clean the snow off your fucking car.
It‚Äôs not a Vermont thing. It‚Äôs a Reddit thing.
Oh ya you think yer a vermonner huh? how many generations?

All joking aside, some of the tourist posts have been borderline brain dead in terms of the things they are asking. Like asking things that just blatantly show that the tourist asking a question already has a definition of vermont and vermonters in their mind which is so off base that it's actually insulting. Or asking something that indicates that they are a Karen who is going to flip their shit when they get here and realize just how hard it is going to be for them to have all the amenities they want and need.

So my point is that I would ask the tourists to at least try and use their brain before just hopping on reddit to have us do their thinking for them. But I also ask residents to not assume everyone coming here/asking questions is such an idiot either. 

We are often treated like a playground for rich tourists, and as such the entire state gets treated like "the help" by these particularly boisterous tourists who unfortunately give all tourists a bad rep. I think a lot of people are just touchy about tourists because of this and I don't blame them. This is a once in a lifetime event for us too, but also a lot of us have no choice but to attempt to go about our normal day meanwhile our state is going to be overrun by people who have the privilege to be here on a day off getting mad at us for not having the infrastructure to support them for a day.

This is honestly a psychologically complex thing and I think "be nice to tourists" and "fuck all these tourists" are both oversimplifying a very complex and emotionally charged issue that requires more finesse and emotional intelligence than either of those mindsets possess.
Depends on how they are acting. I've had people be super rude we weren't running at full capacity at my job. And I very nicely told them they were part of the issue. Stay at a hotel and not an Airbnb. I know so many people that lost housing because of those turds. There's no one to run the business because they had to move
It was me! I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt mean to be rude but I literally didn‚Äôt know how to respond to ‚ÄúAre there any antique shops?‚Äù - usually I‚Äôm more than willing to help with restaurant and other recommendations - but that question‚Ä¶ that question broke me.
Let me be one of the first to say "when they stop being one to me." I will try to be helpful to nice people hoping to move here, or have moved. 
But the guy from Massachusetts who nearly killed me getting off "a noise shotc during hunting season. Or the family that let their kids out of the car to pee in our door yard during foliage season. If they had just asked they could have used the bathroom, been offered a piece of cake, a tour of the barn, and maybe a pony ride for the kids. There are a lot of obnoxious jerks in the world, and I'm done with them.
It seems most places that rely on tourism to make $ have a love/hate relationship with tourists.
I think people are usually more than accommodating, taking the time to answer THE SAME questions over and over and over again when these out of state posters are spending no time googling/browsing the sub (otherwise they would have found their answer immediately, several times over). I think we‚Äôre going to get 100x the visitors we can even handle, if an irritated reddit comment offends someone so much they cancel their plans, stay home and relieve us one less eclipse tourist, oh well‚ÄîI welcome to crowd relief ü§∑
This post reminds me of oil paintings depicting Vermont from the 1800's. One often sees robust, wealthy visitors, surrounded by plainly clothed "locals" serving them (making their fire, plucking their fresh kill, holding their dogs, carrying the rifles, etc.). 

Here we are, hundreds of years later, commenting about it on reddit. It's a strange life, friends.
I think a bad name might be exactly what we need right now. Our fake invented image is whats causing us to be priced out of our home.
Reddit is not a travel agency. Also service industry people in Vermont, NH and Maine are absolute sick of tourists behaving like we should change and accommodate them. As in, the locals needs to change for what a tourist or new resident is used too. When in reality the new resident or tourist should learn the local culture and customs. If you like the way Vermont is and you come to Vermont don‚Äôt be confused when it‚Äôs Vermont. Just like if I go to Colorado, Romania, or heck Egypt. I follow the culture and customs without demanding that I am accommodated and treated special like I am back home.
I live in NY and work in VT (trust me, I‚Äôd love to just move but family is here) and people in VT are uncommonly nice. Part of why I work in VT is so I don‚Äôt have to deal with the nastiness of the Capital Region, lol. There are certainly some jerks but they‚Äôre way easier to tolerate than the NY jerks.
Good, I hope it gives us a bad name. I dont want them to come back. This whole "SUCH AN UNDERRATED TOURIST DESTINATION" gimmick is speeding up gentrification, and it's putting immense stress on towns that DO NOT HAVE THE MONEY OR SPACE to re-plan their roads. So we und up with partially gridlocked towns, worse road conditions between re-paves, and rude people all over the place throwing their trash on the ground, treating our state like dirt, and putting stress on our weak infrastructure.

Don't even get me started on how it encourages our housing crisis by diverting properties away from the housing market, instead incentivizing owners to take advantage of the much more lucrative short term rental market.
I‚Äôm coming to Vermont for the eclipse. Can you guys put on that foliage thing I always hear about?
I lived in VT for a few years.  My parents lived there for more than 70.  I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever had a single person be rude to me when they saw my MA plates.  It‚Äôs New England‚Ä¶people are not ‚Äúoutwardly‚Äù friendly to each other.  But, rudeness is generally reserved for when I go to NY or PA.  LOL.

In general‚Ä¶people aren‚Äôt rude.   Just don‚Äôt walk in like you own the place, say please and thank you, and keep your opinions yours‚Ä¶until you are asked.  You‚Äôll be fine.
Nope. Id say more but i dont feel like setting a new high score in reddit golf today,lol.

Edit(1?): i will say this though, it is kind of unrealistic to expect a local population that is trapped in a low pay tourist economy to keep the same mask on that allows us to scrape out a living when we are at home in our comfortable clothes and in the cups.
[deleted]
Arrr, how be yer feelings 'bout pirates, matey?
As a flatlander from a white plate state, I was going to buy a vacation home in Vermont, but after reading this, I‚Äôve decided to buy two. /s
Good I hope vermont gets a bad name from out of staters personally.  The housing crises isn't going to fix itself.  We aren't dicks to each other, just the tourists who treat our homes like a theme park.
I wish more people understood the phrase ‚Äúfuck around and find out‚Äù,   If your rude I‚Äôll just give them wrong directions
Of all the subs I follow, this one has the most bitter people. 

Every thread, there's always at least one person being an asshole, hating flatlanders, hating homebuyers, hating visitors, hating all-season tires, hating Subarus, hating any opinion that's different than theirs.

"If they're not like me, they're not welcome to VT" - it's exhausting.
Born and raised Vermonters are generally pretty rude to ‚Äúflatlanders‚Äù and act with an air of superiority.

(Born and raised Vermonter‚Äôs opinion)
OP, when using social media and getting triggered by people, it's smart to take in account, how many updoots or how many people actually agree with the person. Most post here have double digit interaction. Meaning that's a fraction of Vermonters agreeing with them. Also commonly known as the vocal minority. 

From one grown adult to another, do yourself a favor and block those people. You'll never see them again. At the end of the day every is allowed to have an opinion even if you don't like it, but you're allowed to block any opinions you don't like.
Though a CEO of my own consulting firm, I enjoy driving for UBER sometimes after work to clear my head and engage with the public, and in that capacity I meet a lot of tourists, and I can‚Äôt name a single time they treated me like the help, seemed entitled or were anything but genuinely good people here to have a good experience. Most first time visitors in for a conference or other work have made comments of how well they‚Äôve been treated here, or other things they‚Äôve enjoyed about the experience. (Even when the weather is totally crappy!) I think we need to be careful with our stereotypes and generalizations, whether we are talking about ‚Äúflatlanders‚Äù or ‚Äúwoodchucks‚Äù. 

‚Ä¶Though somehow drunk frat boys still fall into a pretty narrow band of behavior! <3
Totally agree. People just like being mean on Reddit, including on this sub. Visitors are always welcome, as long as you act safely and respectfully.
[deleted]
I had a woman tell me she never leaves the state to justify being shitty to visitors.  Absolutely wild.
I feel like this is a moderation issue. Everyone's saying this is just how people are on Reddit but this is not the norm on other locally focused subs for other states/cities.
I‚Äôve noticed since moving to Vermont about a year ago that Vermonters online can be real assholes/downers/maximalists.  The Vermonters I interact with in real life are almost uniformly nice, welcoming, and helpful.  Except for the one little old lady at the grocery store checkout that never says ‚Äúhi‚Äù back, but I just assume she‚Äôs got her own shit going on.
Reddit has a bad name. Vermonters are just confused to why no one can look up sub history? Like the same questions are posted over an over again. Simply googling something followed by Reddit would save all of us a ton of time. And as someone who‚Äôs lived here their whole life I don‚Äôt really give a fuck what out of staters think of us. I‚Äôd rather give them the ability and educate then keep out states charm
I once saw a bumper sticker "Not all Flatlanders are assholes, and not all locals are cool". I've certainly met my fair share of "rural folk" that acted like Flatlanders.
[deleted]
To visitors?  There's a good chunk of rightwing Vermont that's horrible to a most of our residents.
I‚Äôm glad someone took the time to make this post. It‚Äôs long overdue. It seems like everyone from out of state who asks for advice gets immediately down voted for no reason.

I love my fellow Vermonters but we sure can be a judgmental  bunch.
I try to only do it when I'm stuck behind a car with out of state plates
What happened to if you can‚Äôt say anything nice‚Ä¶?

Social media happened giving everyone a voice with no consequences for their actions
I‚Äôm heartened by how upvoted this post is.
That damn interstate..wish they never put it in...leve it to them Flatlanders and will be like mass in 20-25 years..cutting into our mountains to build there homes.and don't even live in them..just visit from time to time..sorry just saying..
I‚Äôm mean because I grew up in New England.
People from every state are mean online
Reddit does suck but lol if anyone thinks the average eclipse tourist is even aware that a bunch of online freaks are complaining here
Hmmm... how can I explain that tourism is vital to our economy without being downvoted?  

As someone who worked many years in service jobs I dealt with many entitled and occasionally violent jerks. No one should be allowed to get away with being a dick to people doing them a favor by bringing them food or selling something to them at a cash register. We need to get rid of this ridiculous customer is always right bullshit everywhere,  not just in Vermont. If someone starts out rude, by all means take the gloves off and feel free to inform them of their shortcomings. 

That said, someone simply existing here and behaving within the bounds of civility should be welcomed. We need their money. This eclipse could make up for the lost revenue from the devastating flood of 2023. 

If you work in the service industry, f*ck anyone who tells you to kiss the rod or acts like they are better than you. But, be cool, you don't have to even be friendly, to tourists. Vermont indifferent qualifies as moderately friendly in some of the places these people come from.
It's the same in every state/city subreddit. I wouldn't take it too personally. We're a cynical bunch.
Looks Mean.
Is Nice.
Entire roads are unpaved over much of the state and Mud Season is something we all endure to keep the visitors out!  This is the sacrifice we make!  üòé
Lived in vermont my whole life, I get both sides. To be fair though, without tourists 75% of us wouldn‚Äôt have jobs. Vermont has the lowest GDP of all 50 states, you should be thanking them for coming here lmao. Unless your 60+ years old and own a farm, you need the tourism üòÇü§™
It's not just visitors. People in this sub are assholes to literally anyone who wasn't born and raised here.
No. Some of us are fed up with being the wealthy‚Äôs playground.
I do really enjoy this sub, I am from out of state, with aspirations of moving to VT, but do not feel the vibe of this community is consistent with the many really good people and now friends I have there. I'm talking about born and raised in rural VT kind of folks. Agree with the comments that say it's a reddit thing. Or just simply an internet thing.
Not all state subs are as unwelcoming as ours. I follow several b/c I've lived all over. Vermont doesn't belong to anyone. I was a Navy brat & I'm not really from anywhere. In the US, people are allowed to relocate & travel among the states, and some people's jobs demand it. 

Maybe don't answer tourist questions, or if you decide to, be nice.
> Those of you who are unwelcoming and rude on this forum are giving VT a bad name, and I would request (as a fellow Vermonter) that you stop that shit.

No.  

Or actually, yes, I'll stop being rude on this forum.  I've always been much more rude to flatlanders IRL anyway.
I'm betting most of the people that post here are recent transplants.
I absolutely agree. The message was clear, stay the F&$& out of Vermont!
If my dick behavior keeps ONE snowbird from buying a house in VT it‚Äôs worth it :D
[deleted]
Spent 5 years in Burlington Vt. Politics aside one of the greatest ‚Äúsmall cities‚Äù in America.
The sunset in Battery Park is the best. Driving to thru ‚Äúthe notch‚Äù on a day trip awesome
But the people who got ‚ÄúVermont‚Äù as their place of music on Spotify‚Äôs wrapped are cool right?!?
But but but , I kinda like Vermont even though I‚Äôm not from there I have always felt welcome in your state and it‚Äôs really pretty. I‚Äôm not coming for the eclipse I‚Äôm not that self hating
Seems like a cultural thing when something like property taxes are significantly higher when VT isn‚Äôt your primary residence no matter how long you have owned the property. Had someone recently tell me that the tax assessor told them ‚Äúyou‚Äôre from CT, you can afford it‚Äù. As if every CT resident is in the Gold Coast. Median income in VT is on par with NY lol
When the visitors get snow tires
In all fairness, we're also rude and unwelcoming to each other. I'm sure the junkies will ask for change politely.
Put some tolls around just for Flatlanders to help keep are roads..that don't put anything in my pocket..just more work for all of us..good for business but not for workers..sorry just saying.
It‚Äôs all lame, anyone with that attitude is a loser. Most of them are probably real chucks who are lonely. Sad but true, to act like you own the state who tf are you. üòÇüòÇ
They don't put nothing in my pocket..just the states pockets and small business pockets..this state is going to hell quickly...seen big change in my time and not good..it's all about money!! This state wasn't built on lots of money..just hard work and good neighbors..just saying.
We'll skip right over Vermont and spend our tourist money in Quebec.
Just adding my 2 cents as a new englander, but one from the flatlands. 

Vermont already has a reputation of having a  weird and unwelcoming vibe towards visitors that veer out of the tourist spots and ski resorts. 

I get it too; a lot of city folk don't know how to behave themselves out in the country, and if they end up moving in, they wanna change how things work, which sucks.

But northern New England is truly something special and we should collectively wanna share that and welcome guests all over our region. 


All of that to say, in all the times I've been to Vermont, people have been extremely friendly and courteous. Got lost on a guys farm once looking for my cousin's house, saw him approach me and got worried he'd be angry. Dude smiled, shook my hand, and gave me directions.
sounds like someone from mass wrote this‚Ä¶
People complain Vermont is not business friendly and businesses can‚Äôt survive yet complain about a few days that will most likely bring a huge amount of money to those businesses. Get of the forum for a week if it annoys you so much.
Vermont is the 48th best state in the country
No
If it makes you feel better, no one from NY or CT will care if you're an overt asshole. We will just feel at home.
"Vermonters and visitors alike".  Either those criticizing are not true Vermonters, or true Vermonters are criticizing those who THINK they are Vermonters, and visitors.
We had a lovely visit
The Vermont economy does take in a lot of money from visitors.   Look at all those ski areas, retail shops, ice cream, coffee, restaurants, and gift shops.    $penders! 

Keeping trash off the roads, small road signs and decent people keep the visitors coming.  And they are paying a heck of a lot in sales tax every month.     

"Don't bite the hand that feeds you" is a good lesson for Vermonters.   

It is a small state with limited ability for crowds based on hotel space and the roads.   It will get busy, but not like LA.  So just chill.  Take the back road.  We do drive slow for tractors.   You can also chill for the BMW that is paying the sales tax.

I‚Äôll never understand the hostility towards someone for simply visiting your state from across an imaginary line. Some people are way too uncultured and insecure.
Hey, my wife and I visited last year, everyone was actually pretty nice and friendly! Cept that one dude on the highway in Subaru...ü§£
A lot of small business owners rely heavily on tourists, it's a major source of revenue for our state that doesn't have many sources of revenue.  Be kind to the tourists, let them spend money and appreciate our beautiful state!

ETA: the fact that a post saying "be nice" gets downvoted tells you all you need to know about this sub! 

I hope visitors realize that people in Vermont are much nicer than people on this sub.
I fully support the hostility. As someone in NH I‚Äôm sick of all the transplants and the tax free masshole shoppers
Ironic...

"Stop being a dick" But also "those who are rude, stop that shit"
Luckily, most people who are the worst on here are just a very vocal minority. They get to say all the nasty things they never would in person in the safety of online anonymity.

Blame Reddit if you want but Facebook is even worse. Between crying about today being a snow day and how how dare people want to come here on monday for a once in a lifetime event for many. People just suck in general.
My name is Richard 

I can go by D*ck if I want

It‚Äôs not my choice to be a D*ck

My momma gave me that name
In real life the dumb people are too scared to shout these obscenities and the smart people understand where the revenue comes from (tourism). It's just a reddit thing.
The rudest person I‚Äôve ever encountered in the wild was in Vermont. I was walking my dog (a rescue) and she was walking some fluffy, fancy dog. When my dog tried to say hello to hers I asked if it was okay and she scowled at me and said, ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù extremely rudely. I‚Äôve never been so put off. Usually dog people are nice.
lol spend ur money and get tf out
Reddit problem, not a real life problem
Go the fuck back to Jersey.
Yeah Reddit is for scum!
We have to differentiate between the tourist and the guy who actually moves here, is a dick to his neighbors, runs for office, etc. Nuance.
Pocahontas told me the wind would help if I was running late
But the 60 MPH sweep works pretty good!
Eh, as a born and raised VTer the xenophobia definitely runs strong w/ in VT‚Äôs culture. Reddit just broadcasts it more openly.
It's not a Vermonter in real life thing, it's a Vermonter on Reddit thing.

I've lived in a few different places, and the local area subreddits have never been as salty and unwelcoming as the Vermont subreddit.

Of course, the actual locals in real life have rarely been as friendly as Vermonters in real life, and I far prefer it that way.
I disagree; I follow a few subs that are pretty nice- this one is salty AF, especially in contrast to actual real-life interactions in VT.
Both
That's true.  I see so many people say it's gatekeeping, but a lot of people in the sub will shit on vermonters and tourists alike.  This sub and the Burlington sub is the same. Salty fucks.
I am seeing it on Facebook as well. As a Vermonter, I am embarrassed.
It's particularly strong on this sub.
Are you implying that the people on Reddit think the format gives them permission to be condescending assholes to others?? Hmm never noticed..üòÇüòÇ
NH sub is very similar.
It‚Äôs common for any resident of an area visited by tourists lol
I used to frequent a city subreddit with very similar posts and it's 100% different than the comments here. It's definitely a Vermont Reddit thing.
Idk. Vermont subreddit is pretty rude and nativist.
It‚Äôs definitely a Kingdom thing‚Ä¶
It‚Äôs more than VT and Reddit. I‚Äôve lived in several different states, every one of them has these kinds of assholes.
> the tourist posts have been borderline brain dead in terms of the things they are asking.

yep - for people coming here with lots of money, they sure do not know how to google or use any sort of deductive reasoning...

> We are often treated like a playground for rich tourists, and as such the entire state gets treated like "the help" by these particularly boisterous tourists who unfortunately give all tourists a bad rep.

It's the standard. Remember, a lot of them think Vermont is not for us, but for them. 

> This is honestly a psychologically complex thing and I think "be nice to tourists" and "fuck all these tourists" are both oversimplifying a very complex and emotionally charged issue that requires more finesse and emotional intelligence than either of those mindsets possess.

This is the most honest and correct take on the issue.
Yeah many of the tourist posts on here give off "I'm coming here, you need my money to live. Please serve me" and then proceed to ask the absolute dumbest question imaginable. 

Especially with the eclipse. There are so many "what is the most secluded high elevation hiking trail I can find" posts.
>Or asking something that indicates that they are a Karen who is going to flip their shit when they get here and realize just how hard it is going to be for them to have all the amenities they want and need.

I have this vivid memory of after Hurricane Irene when a woman from NJ, who was stuck at her rental near Killington after Route 4 washed out, was endlessly calling emergency lines and spamming FB pages DEMANDING first responder attention to get her and her family down the mountain IMMEDIATELY!!1! Absolutely no recognition that a main east-west artery was temporarily nonexistent and that therefore EVERYONE ELSE WAS ALSO STUCK. Stuff like that is almost certain to happen along various dirt roads traversing the eclipse zone on Monday (especially with all the snowmelt we'll have) so yes, if we can knock a little sense into anyone coming to this group to ask dumb questions, might as well try to do it before the fact.
Thank you for saying this. I‚Äôm in the service industry and it is a very accurate take.
Very well said!
+1 for vermonner LOL

I think it still goes back to "if you cant say anything nice". Then the annoying questions will be met with either helpful answers or silence. And silence is much better for our reputation than asshattery.
>This is honestly a psychologically complex thing and I think "be nice to tourists" and "fuck all these tourists" are both oversimplifying a very complex and emotionally charged issue that requires more finesse and emotional intelligence than either of those mindsets possess.

Both of these things are a single, overlapping circle. 

Spot on take.
The state is a playground, this is the mf usa. It‚Äôs not yours.
"I'm coming up for the eclipse what is the best hiking trail" has been posted like 6 times in the past day

Don‚Äôt answer then
Ya but the shitty people in this sub don‚Äôt operate in the sunlight. Someone who is moving here is interacting with real estate agents, doctors, dentists, restaurant workers, neighbors. And they‚Äôre all normal people. The only power the little bucket crab cynics have on this sub remains in this sub.

I had a side hustle one summer at one of the more privileged summer hospitality spots and got berated by a guest who wanted to bike from Burlington to Middlebury on a bike path along the lake the entire way. I had to explain multiple times that this‚Ä¶doesn‚Äôt exist.

Ya but this sub spends half its time dreaming up the ultimate asshole tourist caricature to vent against. It‚Äôs really sad
Purchase them on either side of a working farm for the views, and then spend your every waking moment trying to get the State to close down the farm, to preserve the environment.

And most people do. Not all, of course, but even the ones who do things like pull over to take a picture are pretty non-offensive!  This sub is mean.
People in VT act like they‚Äôre the only people with outdoors.   A lot of the visitors are from NJ.   They had Action Park.  That‚Äôs more dangerous than anything in VT.   Google it.
Vermin.
Sad, waste of life
Bingo. The mods of this sub need to step it up a bit
Sometimes sayin' nothin' says enough
This. There is a vocal minority of absolute deplorable people on this sub. They do not walk among us.
You don‚Äôt own the Sun, you don‚Äôt own the moon, you don‚Äôt own Vermont. You own the little bit of space you purchased or you rent. Outside that, deal with it.
Lol for real? I won‚Äôt even try and change your opinion but this is straight up selfish.
You shouldn‚Äôt be proud of that trait
It's just tough when the hospitality jobs that make that tourism possible don't pay their workers enough to afford housing. I have a coworker who commutes in from over the NY border, and there are people in my town who are working at the supermarket and living at the hotel, because all the housing either belongs to AirBnB landlords, or is priced far above what a working class person can afford. These problems are the result of wider economic processes that most people have no control over, and they're not unique to Vermont, but it's not gonna engender good feelings, when you can get paid 2 to 3 times the federal minimum and still be priced out of housing.
You can certainly cater to tourists while on the job. There is no obligation to do so while not on the clock and/ or browsing on Reddit.
You're certainly allowed to have your opinions, I'm just asking that you not contribute to giving our state a bad name...
Maybe you should leave
Two different worlds
> Vermont doesn't belong to anyone

Especially New York. 1777, never forget!
Maybe if the tourists put in the smallest modicum of research effort and didn't act like everyone living in VT is there to serve them people would be less rude
Sure you have. I guarantee you‚Äôve never done more than glare at a tourist and they prolly had no fucking clue you were even doing it. Pathetic.
If it weren't for flatlanders, we'd be the Alabama of the northeast.
I'd be happy if you took your rudeness to people IRL and see how that works out for you!
Make them. Like what are you gonna do about it? Put your money where your mouth is and physically remove a tourist from the state. Fucking anonymous cowards man
You should leave
Unfortunately Burlington has been overrun by junkies. Walk down church street and there‚Äôs hobo‚Äôs sleeping on the sidewalks and shooting up in the alleyways in between, needles everywhere. I work at UVMMC, that‚Äôs the furthest into Burlington I go now unless I have to.

Have you see twitter?
Well, THAT narrows it down...;)
I‚Äôm a tourist who has loves visiting Vermont (particularly the NEK).  I‚Äôve never had a bad interaction and often leave wishing my community treated each other better (if even just for show). But I‚Äôm not ahole to the people I am visiting. If I was I‚Äôd expect to be treated like an ahole. This isn‚Äôt a Vermont thing and this has nothing to do with Vermont‚Äôs revenue streams. If you behave poorly anywhere you should expect to be treated poorly.
There's a difference between being kind to tourists and rolling over and taking it from shitty tourists. Part of this mindset comes from the fact that we engrain this belief in Vermonters that we have to put up with asshole tourists in order to survive. Partially true, but psychologically not surprising that it breeds resentment. 

But Believe me, putting a few rich assholes from CT or wherever in their place is not going to break the state's economy ffs. I say tourists get out what they put in - approach every interaction with kindness and when they start screaming at you for the fact that our state doesn't have a Target and a public bathroom every 10 feet flip em the bird and leave em to figure their own shit out.
I see this all the time online like it is some kind of burn? Is this some kind of might makes right fallacy..like if i was the bigest fish i could say wtf ever i wanted? i mean only a masochist would spout thier inner thoughts on things like we do here in polite..or worse company,lol. IDK i got bad filters when im home and shields down/mask off.

sorry but it might be one of those nights for me cause its been one of those days,lol

It‚Äôs true. I am scum so I know.
you'll never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.
Right! Go to tik tok or Facebook if you want normy vibes.
Take one look at Burlington and ask yourself why Vermonters don‚Äôt like transplants.
That's because we don't like aliens. 

The alien crisis is going to come full force once the AARO opens up more investigations to the public.
>It's not a Vermonter in real life thing, it's a Vermonter on Reddit thing.

I dunno, I know plenty of Vermonters who bitch endlessly about tourists. The difference is they mostly do that in conversation with other Vermonters instead of directly AT the tourists. (Exceptions here too obviously, like we have our road rage moments like any other place in the US.)
I feel like people come to this sub to vent to other people who understand where they're coming from. I don't condone it, but I sort of understand it.

As a Vermonter, you're part of a relatively small club in comparison to other states. We don't get much representation in media or pop culture, so it can sometimes feel like we've been forgotten about. So, while many of the issues facing our state aren't necessarily unique, it can make them feel more personal. 

We're a rural state. We have a lot of people who live fairly secluded lives, cut off from others with whom they could talk and vent their daily frustrations.

We're an aged state. There are many people who live in areas where they may not have anyone of their generation that they'd feel really gets them and their struggles. 

So, they come to reddit, where they know they'll find an audience who'll listen and all done anonymously so they can really let loose. 

Idk, that's just my theory. Yeah, I wish people were as friendly as they are in real life, and some people are just straight-up assholes, but at least on reddit, we can choose to scroll right past the negativity and even block people should we so choose.
It‚Äôs not at all uncommon for subs to be annoyed by repeated low effort questions that treat the user base as an internet search when the questioner demonstrates zero effort at researching the topic first.

For example, this was so bad in my kayaking sub that they created an auto response with some responses about common questions.
Nope. I‚Äôve experienced it and I have had friends experience it. I know it‚Äôs a minority of you, but there‚Äôs a definitely a slice of your population that doesn‚Äôt like flatlanders.

No. It‚Äôs real. You did not live in Vermont with out of state plates in March/April 2020.  It was heartbreaking.
I agree, this is one of the nasiest, most gate-keeping local subreddits.
Dunno, it does kinda seem to be a Vermonter in Real life thing... left for work in Northern California, came back and was pretty much called a flatlander to my face by strangers from the NEK while in a temporary n-hood (5S)... there are more than 40 mountain ranges in California; from 2-10K feet hikeable high, not including the ones that line the border of the state: Cascades, Sierra, and Mammoth, that i frequented with various gear (hike, ski, shoe, climb, camp). 

Everyplace good is riddled with tourists, good and bad. I'm just glad we finally got a day of winter this week. I came back here for the winter, dammit! Maybe I'll go to the PNW where the trees are green all winter. It's all brown and whiney and crimey here now. 7 is a strip mall with semi trucks, the notch is not funny anymore and the politics are mind numbingly idiotic.
Can confirm. CT resident and the CT sub can be sooo toxic. I‚Äôve been to Vermont idk how many times in my life and never had a bad experience.
Dude I grew up in Windham County in the 90's before the internet and people bitched about New Yorkers and out of staters all the time.¬†
> this one is salty AF, especially in contrast to actual real-life interactions in VT.

that's what u/ElDub73 is saying.
People who move here are not automatically Vermonters.
Every city subreddit is at least 75% bitching and moaning
There may be some of that going on, yeah.
I love the ones that start out innocent and nice, and then with the slightest critical response they turn into absolute shitty monsters throwing around that tourist card like you're saying. Like sick dude, thanks for showing your true colors.
Are there so many?  How many?

If you look at the last week in this sub for posts that actually get travtion, you really don't seenthat many stupid tourists at all even you just assume the tourist is dumb without reading. 

I can find like 5 posts from a vermont native giving a  list of "tips" for visitors, but only one post asking if there will be traffic from New York on Thursday. That's a dumb ass question I won't argue, but the ratio doesn't seem to be what you're saying.
We get it you hate tourists, don‚Äôt deny it now your history shows. Look how much it bothers you while the people you are talking about don‚Äôt give a shit. üòÇüòÇüòÇThis damn state isn‚Äôt yours people can come and please as they want.
Exactly. It's easy for people to be on their high horse right now, but come Monday there will be a lot of "main characters" who need to be tended to NOW despite being amongst thousands of others who are in the same exact boat as them. Killing those people with kindness doesn't really work.
Haha we had a wedding on our property that weekend. Had over a hundred out of staters get stuck. We explained to them that with the backup generator they had and the well, that they were actually fine. Our property is the town emergency shelter. It‚Äôs the best place to be. They still flipped out and called 911 over thirty times complaining about being stuck. 
Hilarious.
Hope she was LAST.
Yeah I'm sure one interaction on the Internet is really going to overpower the decades long reputation Vermonters have built through in-person interactions.
Never said it was mine. But it IS my home, and I DO pay more in taxes than some random person on a vacation. Not to mention didn't your parents teach you to play nicely on the playgrounds you were visiting? I'm guessing not.
Also VT emergency personnel are begging people to not go hiking on eclipse day.
Why would anyone feel compelled to answer a question like that‚Ä¶.six times in a day.  Some folks just don‚Äôt understand they don‚Äôt HAVE to engage.
Get off your high horse General Lee, let people have fun.
Look I get you, and of course OP is ultimately right. Everyone should be treated with kindness and respect regardless of the situation. 

I just *get* the rage at tourists. For the most part they are extremely obnoxious and seem to think of us as zoo animals whose primary purpose is to put on an act to make them have a good vacation.
> Ya but the shitty people in this sub don‚Äôt operate in the sunlight.

like fuck I don't!
I honestly dont give a fuck about the rest of the country. 

But I do care that only 16% of Vermonters can afford the median price of a new home. There are no clean villains here, no one is doing anything wrong. 

But the fact remains that there has been a massive influx of people driving prices up who come looking for a place that doesn‚Äôt exist.
It‚Äôs okay for you to have an opinion. It‚Äôs okay for me to have an opinion. My opinion is drawn from 20 years in the service industry.  I don‚Äôt feel hate. Sometimes annoyance but not hate.
It was definitely a tourist who was upset over so many people driving over the 3 covered bridges in Bennington. She thought they should be preserved as antiques and only have pedestrian traffic.  I told her they are preserved and maintained, that's why they can have hundreds of cars using them daily; it's how we cross the river.
Nope. If I'm not here to bring discomfort to tourists, they won't be encouraged to go literally anywhere else.
99% of this sub is complaining about non-Vermont people. It‚Äôs exhausting. Even Burlington‚Äôs subreddit is so much better
Good tip
more like 1 with the way things are going.
Places in Vermont are still very reasonable compared to anywhere near or inside 95 in MA...
Yeah, I don‚Äôt disagree with that.
> You are not superior to anyone for exiting a vagina inside imaginary borders

you act like it is a bad thing to have a reverence for the place you grew up in or the communities you are apart of. There is no superiority complex - it's a matter of seeing things change for the worse, and be othered by those who claim we other them.

Get treated like you're the "help" a few times and be talked down to by some guy in a BMW because you're "simple folk" and unsophisticated to their epicurean ways.
Was the ‚ÄúBorn and raised Vermonter‚Äôs opinion‚Äù part of my comment hard for you to understand?
There is only one real mod here, the rest are too busy preening and polishing their self-made pedestals. They probably won't even see your comment ü§£ü§£
Agreed. They can post mega threads for common topics (hello Eclipse, leaf peeping, ski season), auto remove low effort posts, and cut down on unhelpful/mean spirited comments. I don't know why they aren't!
> The mods of this sub need to step it up a bit

why?

so the rest of us towneys can be treated like inbred servants to the affluent flatlander class?
> They do not walk among us.

Like fuck they don't. They live in your communities and work jobs here. 

Stop trying to erase the Vermont Native.
And some of us coming up literally live on the Vermont border. We just need to come up a little further north to get to the totality. Some of us are your neighbors, separated by a little imaginary line. Be cool, guys!

> I'm just asking that you not contribute to giving our state a bad name...

you know if it did - maybe some of the housing would come down in price. You know cause we have all this demand and no supply...
You literally just got here
But why do yiu have to answer them? Can't you just scroll on by and let someone else answer? 

And...maybe they are just excited about visiting and want to interact with "locals."
Not pathetic at all. It feels great and it's a good thing to do. And yes, I've done a lot more than glare. I'm sure you see the irony in your own internet-tough-guy response. Lol .
You say this like NH doesn‚Äôt exist
Chester A. Arthur, Calvin Coolidge, John and George Dewey, Vermont had a fine history before we locked ourselves into thinking all we are is a playground for out of staters.
Ok
You misunderstand - I've been doing that, for several years now. It's worked out great so far, I recommend it!
He wouldn't because then he'd get his ass kicked lmao
Maybe you shouldn't be in a service industry job if you don't like serving people?

Fair enough. 

Bitching about out-of-state drivers while on the road doesn't count though, right? :)
You call them pussies haha
Nothing wrong with coming here to vent, especially about shared problems! I'll happily join in complaining about the weather or the cost of inspections or the state government's most recent screw up, or anything else. Honestly, seeing people complain about issues they are having to an extent helps forewarn me, as a relative newcomer, of issues I may face later on.

Yeah the local skiing subredd has become flooded lately with posts that are basically. "Where do I go for this storm" "what skis do I buy" with no actual info. Of course they are going to get flamed with snarky and purposly incorrect info
It‚Äôs honestly like that on every specialized sub. It happens on bug, animal and mushroom ID all the time. It makes me wonder how many people actually know about the search feature. It happens everywhere. Not unique to this sub at all, but I understand the frustration.
LDub checks out for kayaking sub. No one cares how high you run the LW.
Bingo!
VT thinks they invented hills
at least you try....
> gate-keeping

lol
I read it as ‚Äúall of Reddit is like that, not just this sub‚Äù; I agree the wording is open to interpretation
I know plenty of folks that moved here that have adopted the Vermont lifestyle, and i know plenty of people born here that moved to burlington to act like folks from other states.  Not sure where i said people that move here are automatically Vermonters though...
Small mindedness does not impress
With Town Meeting Day getting replaced by Australian balloting in places, it's probably going to get worse because now there's no outlet for people to bitch and moan about roads once a year.

Genius of the green mountains here, no shit you don't see them they got voted down and filtered out. You just weren't around for when they 80+ tourists posted the same question within 3 hours of each other.
Being ‚Äústuck‚Äù and without amenities can really trigger some people. Hell my own wife spirals anytime we lose power meanwhile I‚Äôm all giddy firing up our wood cookstove and whatnot. Luckily my wife understands that calling the power company incessantly is unnecessary and a dick move.
Every little bit helps.
Are you assuming I don‚Äôt take care of a place I‚Äôm visiting. Bold assumption.
We live here, so we see those warnings - perhaps they don‚Äôt because they are not here.
If it makes any difference to you I‚Äôm not referring to you in a lot of these comments. You generally seem pretty passionate/productive in your posts even if I don‚Äôt always agree with your opinions. The shitty people I‚Äôm referring to are much more dark and cynical
[deleted]
You sound like a real great contributor to the state
Winters in Vermont are relatively mild compared to Siberia.
Reverence for the place you grew up in !== trashing outsiders.

There‚Äôs a reason why songs like ‚ÄúAmerican the beautiful‚Äù and ‚Äúproud to be an American‚Äù celebrate the country and don‚Äôt spend all their verses trashing other countries and painting foreigners as some sort of evil caricature.
[deleted]
Likely because they aren't paid and don't have the free time haha but the stickied posts seem like low hanging fruit
There are tons of removed comments (maybe some take downvotes harshly? it's not like mods can control downvotes)--and is it just me or do I see similar all the time in other state subreddits? https://www.reddit.com/r/vermont/comments/1bvrcnd/comment/ky2zk3y/?context=3

Apparently you don't notice the sticky posts, though right now we're further drafting an eclipse one which is kind of presently superseding the moving/visiting sticky which is almost always there. The join subreddit welcome message literally recommends r/NewToVermont for anyone visiting or moving to the area. The posting guidelines literally say "If you have a question about moving or visiting, please search the subreddit before posting to see if your questions may have already been answered."
Idk how posting mega threads for common asks and removing low effort posts from people asking the same questions would be treating you like an inbred servant?
Doubt it. Most likely living in basements collecting unemployment. Or they don‚Äôt have the balls to talk this way to people face-to-face. In my experience all natives have been very friendly in-person.
How is that elitist? I‚Äôm telling the poster that the eclipse does not belong to them. It‚Äôs incredibly selfish to complain about a day of inconvenience for a rare event that brings joy to countless people.
Oh I'm not, I'm only interacting with people upset about the folks clowning on clueless tourists who are too lazy to use the search function.
Weird LARP
I have, no ill effects in almost 10 years.
Oof there it is
You literally just moved here and still have this attitude to people, nice. Really bucking the recent transplant stereotype!
Twitter is wildly more toxic. Reddit is actually very helpful if you avoid the cesspools which is fairly easy imo
I can't think of a more magical place to enjoy this celestial event than the UMall parking lot.
I sCummed.
fuck those ayy lmaos!
Exactly, you get a pass for that :-D
I have found that the towns that are least friendly are those with a lot of people who moved here from out of state.  They are very clique oriented, bossy and try to take over everything.
I can understand someone wanting to have some personal info, but at least show me you tried.
r/Icecoast is just awful.  Totally useless.
As they should.  Reddit isn't for the lazy.  These people are too lazy to learn anything.
Twomb is one of those people, he‚Äôs all about local this local that. I‚Äôve seen it on ice coast enough.
Agreed.

It‚Äôs also a lot less likely to bother me personally if it‚Äôs something like ‚Äúhey I‚Äôm looking for a good baseball glove‚Äù or a toaster or a whatever to buy rather than if it‚Äôs someone asking about tourist type stuff.

But that‚Äôs my bias.
lol.
Being a Vermonter is earned over time, not automatic.  Some never become one.
You're obviously from somewhere else.
LOL But at least we do get spared having to sit on terrible chairs and listen to the self-appointed One True Citizen of \[Town\] pound away at the same points over and over to beat everyone into submission. It was \*awesome\* to have to suffer that for hours and hours in order to be able to vote.
That's 4 posts in 3 weeks. Not sure what point you're making
Sounds like you had to be actively looking for them to see them then??

People looking for something to be mad at seems to be the theme of this post.
The national guard landed  in the yard and had a nice long chat about just how fine they all were lol. 
We also tried to give people the heads up that if they wanted to leave they had to go NOW and I heard so many people say ‚Äúoh if it‚Äôs that bad we‚Äôll just leave later‚Äù 
Meanwhile my dad was shoveling trenches into the side of the driveway to save it. It didn‚Äôt work. The culvert at the bottom of the driveway ended up a mile down the road. üòÇ good memories
VEC has a nice site for our outages. For example I can see I'm supposed to get power back in 2hours and 25 minutes
 Of course you do have to have a working smart phone and cell signal.
Knowing when you are getting power back is reasuring.
It's friday afternoon, I'm done work in 20min, and there's no way I'm going to engage in this bullshit debate with you.
As I said, no clean villains.
I don't want the state to grow. Maintaining a small bubble economy is what made Vermont so likeable. If I wanted to live in a state that's nothing more than an extension of the Massachusetts suburbs, I'd just live in NH or Mass.
Huh?
[removed]
Even if there are sticky threads tons of people will just ignore them
>There is only one real mod here
well that's just my real life interactions with tourist class. I used to do a lot of IT work for a resort and maaaan - those people freak out. "WHY ISN'T THE WIFI GIVING ME GB SPEEDS?!", "WHY CAN'T I TORRENT?" or when I get there to fix something, "YOU CAN'T DO THIS RIGHT NOW, BUT WE NEED INTERNET FIGURE IT OUT NERD!"
Bunch of angry chucks

![gif](giphy|fwL2rPfgjMuRuAqzlZ|downsized)
Educate me. What's wrong with my statement?
I've lived in VT for 21 years, they just weren't all consecutive :)

I maintain that people who don't wish to serve others should not be in the service industry. Please note that I didn't say that customers are allowed to be assholes to service employees.
[deleted]
I mean, asking a question on Reddit *is* trying. I like to answer a lot of those questions, otherwise I just ignore them.
It is pretty fun to look at people posting about storms. Get warned that there will be wind holds. And then see those same users make a rage post a day later that there are In fact wind holds.
I mean I mostly just talk about it in the context of clowning on people from NJ who try to act like locals and gatekeep the mountains
Refer to the other guy's screenshot, you really don't have to try. Have a coffee you seem a bit lost.
I think you‚Äôre the one just looming for something to debate lol
Ours often doesn‚Äôt have a time to restore listed which just adds to the anxiety lol
Make a good faith effort to follow [Reddiquette](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439-Reddiquette).
There are other mods that are moderating too.
you have no idea how much moderation goes on here. It is more that the literal nazis require more attention than ignorable lazy potential tourists.
some folks are locked into the service industry because of a lack of education and vocational training. It's not their fault they have to deal with shit bricks constantly belittling them with their elitist attitudes and over inflated self worth.

See the problem really is people with big money - they think they are above everyone and because they have that precious resource of cash, they can do fuck all.
I'm saying twitter is more toxic than reddit which is actually not that toxic. Do you have a reading comp problem?
Yeah but it's funnier to write "big snow NJ" in the comments
r/technicallythetruth
Or this classic:  "I like to ski 'blues.'  I'm driving 6 hours, one way, and I usually ski the Poconos.  But now I'm a mega pass evangelist and will downvote you for saying that Stowe is worse now that Vail took it over.  I have never been to Stowe.  What place will have the fewest people like me at it at 9 am on a Saturday? Tell me exactly how the snow will be in six weeks?  So stoked for the gnar, brah!  Where can I buy Heady Topper when I'm here, dawg?"
Lmao gate keep the mountain from asking questions? Ever think we are just very spoiled to be able to go out and ski or board everyday. People paying all that money to go out and ride ,traveling distances have questions big whoop.
I don‚Äôt get ‚Äútry to act like locals‚Äù, what makes you special tell me. Can you give more context try to act like locals how.
Also you ski or ride at any mountain ? Well dur durrr most of those workers aren‚Äôt from Vermont. Mass nj New York, yes there are some from Vermont but not everyone. Imagine only people from Vermont skied the ‚Äúlocal ‚Äú mountains. They would all be closed in 2 years. Use that big brain of yours. They travel up here from there home state to run the mountain for you.
That's 4 posts in a month. If that is enough to get you all worked up and complaining...then you need more than a coffee. .maybe a good hike. You know any good places?
You wouldn't be so overworked and sensitive if they did their jobs.   I'm not trying to listen to you defend them, i was giving you props for actually managing to do a thankless, payless job, on top of having a real life.  kudo's man.

Edit:  You mean to say that there are others with the title, that think delegation is moderation.
wow.....
[deleted]
In agreeing with you in that point. I think localism is stupid in skiing. Most of the time some dude in icecoast gets all high and mighty about casual skiiers or jerries it's usually some condo owning clown from NJ. It's fun to clown on them
Wow!  You have some kind of chip.
You're going out of your way to be toxic to prove your point. grow up?
Thank you to who said 99%‚â†100%
Thank you to the redditor who posted recently about totality. You explained that 99% ‚â† 100% and I‚Äôm really glad I saw your post. I thought 99% was the same as 100% and planned to stay home today. I saw your post and realized how lucky I am to live so close to the totality. Today I took my toddler up to a fishing access point in Addison County and we got to enjoy totality and it was incredible. She had a great day playing in the mud and we got to witness the eclipse together.  

Without your post I wouldn‚Äôt have bothered to drive up. You gave me a core memory with my daughter today and I am so grateful. 
I was one of a few people who posted here saying that 100% was incomparably better.  I'm glad that some redditors followed our advice. I actually think this eclipse was even better than the 2017 one, which I saw in Tennessee.  The tiny bit of clouds we got here made for a better effect at totality.  Here's the relevant xkcd, in case you need to convince anyone to go for 100% the next time an eclipse comes around. 

https://xkcd.com/2914/
I'm so happy for you!
I am so happy for you and your kid!! 

I heard the same thing in 2017, and I still didn‚Äôt understand the hype, but I drove to totality anyway‚Äî not knowing what to expect. It made me an eclipse chaser of sorts. can‚Äôt wait for 2045 in my hometown in Florida!

it‚Äôs frustrating to try to explain to people why it‚Äôs so cool (hoping that they‚Äôll go to totality), but I guess that‚Äôs the beauty of it, too‚Äî you need to see it to believe it.
I got this exact same advice from a friend a few days ago. Originally I planned on watching from work. WOW do I understand now. Totally worth the 6.5 hour drive from Westmore back to the Brattleboro area.
It‚Äôs pretty amazing how fast the transition is from totality back to a blazing ball in the sky.
Zero comparison between 99% and 100%. 

It took me 12 hours to get home from Stowe, a drive that normally takes less than 3.

Absolutely worth it.
My thanks to all of you who encouraged 100%, also. I've seen partial eclipses and total *annular* eclipses, but never a total full eclipse. My wife and I drove up to a wildlife management area near Addison, and I can't describe how glad I am that we did.

Thank you, thank you, thank you.
I visited Vermont for the first time in my life because of this. It was amazing. 


Vermont is a beautiful state.
Could have been any number of us; glad you made the effort to see the real deal!!!
It truly is apples to oranges. I believed everyone saying that they are completely different experiences, but you really can‚Äôt imagine how different it is unless you experience it. So glad I made the trek to VT from MA and want to thank you guys for putting up with all of us for the weekend
Yes it's not worth driving to it unless you drive to totality. We skipped totality this year because my kids are too young and didn't want to torture them in traffic.¬†


Did 96% or whatever it was here, it's OK but not quite an experience
There really is no comparison! We headed up to Burlington from WRJ and I wouldn't have missed it for the world. We were in the path of the totality in Indiana in 2017, but my FIL had a stroke and we spent the entire eclipse in the emergency department at the hospital. Wasn't going to miss it again, and it was a truly magical experience.
I got to see a toddler witness totality AND enjoy celery for the first time. Big day.
Fortunately I found a map that would show what the max eclipse would be based on location.  What my location said was ‚Äú99.8% drive 30 miles north‚Äù and I am so thankful for that.  usually \~45 minutes along 22A took 3 hours but along the way there were people cheering on the traffic!
I was one of the people making that argument here and I‚Äôm so glad so many people got to see it and understand it now! There‚Äôs no way to understand until you see it. It‚Äôs beyond photos and descriptions, eh? I saw it in 2017 in Oregon and was still blown away way as if I had never seen totality‚Ä¶. I just started laughing hysterically. 

What a weird, beautiful world we live in!
Agree. Before yesterday, I didn't get the hype. I get it now.
As someone living in CT ... everyone thought I was nuts saying I was going to drive to northern VT for the eclipse. They're all like, '"We're getting like 97% here."

Turned out this week is my wife's (teacher) and son's (student) vacation week, so I convinced them to drive up with me. They both said sure, but thought it really was going out of the way for a sliver more.

I had explained to them (for years ... I'd been planning on this since 2014) that the difference between 99.9% and 100% is as great as the difference between 0% and 99.9%.

Once they saw it, they got it. 

Still, others are saying it's a waste of time just to be a bit darker. They don't get it.
It's definitely a way bigger difference than 1% suggests but 99% is still very cool. Anything less is pretty underwhelming.
That‚Äôs wonderful. I missed totality in 2017 and totally regretted it. So I made a point not to miss it this time
This is so wholesome! Who‚Äôs cutting onions?!?!
This is why I love Reddit. Some serious wholesomeness
Really cool that you got to see this with your little one and what an amazing memory for you. It was an amazing experience to say the least
Yep, my dad was in the "it'll be 99% here, we could just stay" camp. But I had driven 1200 miles so he was willing to drive a bit to get into the path of totality.

I think it set in for him that 100% really mattered when it was a few minutes before totality and it was still pretty much normal daylight outside.
yes i also read these threads which convinced me to make a last minute plan to drive up to totality in VT.   it was one of the most amazing things ive ever seen and wouldnt have compared to watching through eclipse glasses.  

my wife watching through glasses at 25%:  oh neat it looks like pacman haha üôÉ

my wife during totality: **speechless and tearful**
OMG I was thinking exactly the same, I drove over 8 hrs in one day to see it but it was worth every minute of it. Such a beautiful moment. Though my kids didn‚Äôt think the same I‚Äôm hopeful one day they will remember our experience.
It's like the speed of light. For an object with mass, the difference between 99% and 100% is unfathomable
When does 99 percent EVER equal 100? Never. Lol.
You‚Äôre welcome!
[removed]
üíØ!!!
Great memories for your family.  Heartwarming!
Funny, we made the trip to TN in 2017 and then just enjoyed this one too. We were further East yesterday so had no clouds. However my opinion differs in that no clouds is vastly better (we had partial  clouds during the 1999 eclipse).
How are u saying ur a eclipse chaser now and gonna wait till 2045?? A true chaser is gonna go for 2026 2027 etc
Also from the Bratt area and agree, 5 and a half hours to get home from Barton (usually a two and a half hour drive) and my fiancee and I still had high spirits. Anyone who says 99% is good enough just won‚Äôt get it until they see 100% totality.¬†
Yeah... When it was fully obscured I had no problem looking directly at it even through binoculars. As soon as the first 0.01% sliver came back it was blinding again.

Honestly I'm glad I made the trip up from Jersey. 

Your state is astonishingly beautiful and even being stuck in gridlock traffic on a two lane country road was pleasant since we were stuck during golden hour and had great views of the mountains and Lake Champlain.

Here I am at work only 5 hours after finally getting home and not regretting a single second.
Yes! I will travel to the next one because now I know what to expect. Dark to light blew me away, after already looking around in awe for the 3 min of totality. The light that stayed all around us on the horizon like a sunrise‚Ä¶.I can‚Äôt stop thinking about this amazing experience.

And the stars that came out and the coolness and the people all around also not knowing what to say. Awestruck!

Beautiful Vermont, we had no traffic on back roads and beautiful scenery‚Ä¶.and I saw a marshmallow farm! Lucky!

Addison was the perfect place to see it, in my opinion! The weather was incredible
And you came during the (technically) ugliest time of year and still have that opinion ‚ò∫Ô∏è VT truly is one of the most beautiful states in the country.¬†
Dude, y'all were really pleasant and courteous. The experience was well worth the traffic and the crowds. We aren't used to that kind of volume up here, but it was pretty controlled. Went about as smoothly as one could hope for given the circumstances. It took 1.5 hours to get to my site. 7.5 hours to get home. But it was so worth it. People were driving in almost stand-still traffic with their windows down talking with each other about how epic it all was. Super endearing.

Where did you go in VT?
Same! I went into it thinking, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be cool, but it was way more than I could have imagined. My daughter‚Äôs first reaction was ‚Äúoh! The cow jumped over the moon!‚Äù Which was so cute and innocent I‚Äôll never forget it. 

Every visitor I encountered was very pleasant and my drive home was about 45 minutes longer than it typically would have been but even the traffic wasn‚Äôt too bad on 22a, for me at least.
Yes! I live in Rutland county and my town was listed as 99% and change and I honestly thought that was close enough. Addison is less than an hour on a normal day. Took me about 2ish hours to get home on 22 which honestly wasn‚Äôt as bad as I expected.
Totally! I went into thinking it would be cool but I couldn‚Äôt have imagined just how awestruck I was going to be. I wish my daughter is old enough to remember (she‚Äôs 2) but it was a great day overall. Her initial reaction to totality was ‚Äúoh! The cow jumped over the moon!‚Äù
Me too :) my favorite of all the social medias!
I‚Äôm sure they will one day! I have a lot of fond memories and experiences with my parents that I know I groaned about in the moment
Totally makes sense when you say it like that! In my head I was like, yea 99% is close enough, but these are massive celestial objects and it makes complete sense that the 1% difference is monumental
2nd row seats at a concert
"You get to keep 99% of your lottery winnings"

Or are we being math pedants?
99% of a home run is a nice fly ball, but you're still out.
Meant it more as I thought 99% was close enough to 100% that it would be nearly the same. I‚Äôm glad they posted that it isn‚Äôt because i would have missed out on a truly spectacular day
McCuen Slang!
I am also going to Egypt in 2027. 

don‚Äôt you have better things to do than interrogate people on a lighthearted sub?
Also brat area. I guess I got unlucky.  7 hours for me from Lake Willoughby
Wow, how long did it take you to get back to NJ?

  
I'm a transplant from Sussex County NJ myself.  I do miss the food.  Next time bring bagels ;-)
That first sparkle of the second diamond ring is a sharp reminder to put the filters back on!
That‚Äôs where we store the cows until winter is over.
We thought so, too! Not only that, but we didn't even know that WMA existed‚Äîand we're birders. Definitely going back again and taking our binoculars this time.
I hear ya. I was thinking to myself how much more picturesque it probably is in the warmer seasons. Thanks for having us. Truly a magical experience and time we had.
Driving home to Massachusetts from Derby Line yesterday, I was thinking thank god (for Vermonters' sake) that this eclipse wasnt in any other season to keep tourism down.
I‚Äôm glad you had a good experience! We went to Waterbury Center State Park. Took us about 2.5 hours to get there (no traffic on the way up) and a little over 6 hours to get back home
I was talking with people at work who thought it would be good enough at 99%.  And now they are sad.
Ah envious! We left our 2 year old in daycare ü´§ (We were afraid the drive back to southern VT could take 5 hours) oh well, maybe she‚Äôll see one in 20 years
Oof, that‚Äôs rough. We truly believe if we didn‚Äôt ditch the highway at exit 24 (Lyndon) after crawling 20 miles in an hour, we would have been in a similar situation. We ended up going through some backroads in Danville and Peacham, then down 25 through Corinth and hopped back on 91 in Fairlee where things were at least moving at 40-50 mph. Then ditched the highway again in Rockingham. It was definitely a wild night.¬†
Hello former neighbor! I lived in Sussex county for 13 years up until moving in with my partner in Passaic county last year!

As for my trip back, we left the parking garage in Burlington around 6pm last night. Even without any service, Google Maps told us to avoid rt 7 and interstate 87 at all costs until pretty much Albany, so it took us and thousands of others down these 2 lane country roads right out of Burlington, where we crawled at walking speed for two hours.. not terrible since it was golden hour and beautiful out.

After that, it took us down roads less traveled through NYS paralleling 87 until finally rejoining it near Albany.

We finally got home at 2: 15AM and I looked into work 5 hours later haha.

But no regrets at all. Last night's inconveniences become today's cherished memories.
Oh that hurts my heart for them. I wish it was easier to explain the difference
Well at least you had the right attitude about the drive! 

  
I grew up in Sparta and after college worked in Riverdale and lived in Lincoln Park.  If you bring Pizza next time you come back we'll all thank you.
When some of the people who crowded the highways in VT got to Massachusetts, they were met with the State Police as people were flowing in like swarms. Took me 8.5 hours to get home. Started at 530. And that included backroads.
they understand now!
No way! I was over in Franklin and hang out in Riverdale and Lincoln Park almost every week.

I'll be sure to try to bring some decent pie and perhaps a Taylor Ham Egg and Cheese on a bagel up next time!

I have no idea about the quality of Vermont's pizza/ bagels though, I assume they're working with similar water and other ingredients as NJ, and likely have tons of transplants so I can't imagine it would be terrible like 4/5ths of the rest of the country
Strangely, on my Odyssey from Burlington through NY back to Jersey, the only police I saw were the ones directing traffic in Burlington itself.
Wow! That could have gone pretty badly. I‚Äôm glad you are safe and sound.
Had a visitor yesterday evening 
Never seen one with antlers before. Took a few seconds to realize he was real and that I had time to grab my phone. When I first saw him he was almost right in front of me! He was so calm!
[deleted]
Your hydrangea tree is gorgeous! So is the moose haha!
I love this state so much. Thanks for sharing your video with us. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Ahh this is so cool!
Stunning thank you for sharing!
Sweet! What part of VT?
is it already fall in VT??
That's awesome! Since the moose lottery we hardly see them any more. We actually just saw one yesterday too! In a place that used to have them frequently but hadn't seen one there in years. It was great to see. (Female that we saw)
I just love you kept the ‚Äòsneaking-up‚Äô part in the video

Hello fellow Vermonter.
Stay alert!
What a handsome moose! I haven‚Äôt seen one with antlers yet irl either, but hoping it‚Äôs also when i‚Äôm not in a vehicle and we also leave one another alone lol
Awesome!!
Even with seeing them all the time, it's still nice seeing them more.
How sweet!
The way I didn't see him for sooo long because I was expecting like a bug or a humming bird or something üòÇüòÇ
Hello?!!  That was a bold statement.  What if he came prancing over to say hello back??
how old is an elk before it becomes a moose
Beauty!
ü§ç
He looked at you and decided it wasn‚Äôt a good idea to be on camera next to a hydrangea that big
Awesome
There‚Äôs this amazing guy in Alaska who has nondomesticated moose living on his property and bringing their young. It‚Äôs so cool. And his cats get along with them too.
Or you see this near center of Vermont?
Awesome!!
I'm sorry that the awesome moose was very unimpressed by you, hooman. üòè
A LEGGY horse - that‚Äôs for sure
yes i‚Äôm not detracting from the moose but that hydrangea is the stuff of dreams!!! i can only imagine how beautiful that must have been this past year. they really popped and i bet this particular plant looked like a masterpiece
üòÜ
Between Windsor and Plymouth.
Pretty much. Should have peak color in a couple of weeks. Not much rain lately so color may be dull.
It was more than hunting that has changed the moose population. Ticks. Climate change.
The moose lottery is the only reason you see any moose at all. Too many moose is more harmful to the herd than too few. A lot of Vermonters don't understand how fortunate we are to have the Fish and Wildlife management that we do.
Then you get the opportunity to pet it/go to the hospital!
I now understand...
...why people flocked in to see this. Such an incredible day. Drive safely everyone, to wherever you may be going. 
The biggest shock was how dark and cold it got. A humbling experience
I knew it would be cool, but I had no idea just how amazing.
This picture captured the little red thing in the lower left! Was that a solar filament?
Absolutely breathtaking from MRG. I get the hype now, but glad I just had to go down the hill to be home. Special day.
Pretty cool right? Brings tears to these dry eyes
I can't stop thinking about it. It was amazing.
I feel bad for the people who don't understand why this was amazing
I've been looking forward to this for seven years now idk what to do with myself hahaha

Was quite the experience, not sure if it was life changing, but cool to see.
100% same
Same, same, same.
‚ÄúNo big deal.  Why are people coming here in private jets?  It‚Äôs just going to get dark for a few minutes‚Äù.   I ended up crying.

I don't know how someone can go through the totality and not be changed on the other side. It's probably the most significant celestial event you can experience and one of the only events where so many people are experiencing it together at the same time. Millions of people simultaneously experiencing the feeling of awe. Just in our small group that experienced it together spent the rest of the day trying to wrap our heads around it.
Spectacular event! I made it to the Burlington waterfront. I know there was a lot of people, but it didn't feel that way. Totality is really an amazing once in a life time experience!
TOOK US 12 HOURS TO GET HOME. Traffic was so bad bro
I don't get it. I live where it was 98% and chose to drive away from the circus for the week. We were able to see it at 80% and continued on with our day. Very happy with our decision!
Glad you had such a profound life changing moment with such unimportant nonsense
The mass exodus on route 89 last night needs to be studied by science.
What an experience!
Vermont is beautiful. 
Thanks for having us. I was scared bc it's not very diverse but everyone was so nice. 
Will be back for cider donuts and falling leaves.
It felt like the sun was dying.

Really put into perspective how much we rely on the sun.
The cold really got me. Felt so lucky to just hang on the deck.
I got goosebumps about a minute before totality.   


Not because of the gravity of the event. Shit got cold.
Add to that the silence after an initial cheering. 

You could feel the awe that enveloped the area. It was wild to experience.
I was sitting on a patio next to a thermometer and could see the needle visibly move - the temperature dropped literally 15 degrees in 15 minutes as totality approached
Yeah, I didn‚Äôt realize just how weird it would be, in the best way possible
I missed it. Can you explain? Ppl seem to be thrilled by this
It‚Äôs a Filament when seen against the solar disk, but a prominence when it projects beyond the disk and seen against dark space.
This article describes what they were (prominences): https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/red-dots-around-total-solar-eclipse-explained/

> A solar prominence is a massive loop of the sun‚Äôs plasma that hangs attached to the visible surface of the sun
>‚Ä¶
> Prominences often appear reddish because their plasma can originate deeper in the sun‚Äôs atmosphere, in a layer called the chromosphere, which is characterized by hydrogen at high temperatures that emits red light.
I need an answer to this question! We were all wondering what that was.
Same. People pooping on my parade like it's ok if you're not into it like let me enjoy my astrological phenomena go pout somewhere else.
I contemplated not doing anything.  Then looked it up and realized the next total eclipse is ~2045.  I might be dead by then.  Decided it was worth the effort.  Was not disappointed
lady at shaws the other day was telling me to just watch it on youtube and how she was refusing to look up because it is all some stupid attraction for flatlanders blah blah blah. just hope she got to see it and changed her mind
Explain it to us. It was kinda interesting but after I fall asleep tonight I‚Äôm probably never going to think about it again.
Iceland in ‚Äò26 and then Northern Africa / Mediterranean / Red Sea in ‚Äò27.
Your cried? Lmao
Anyone want to switch seats?
From where to where? Must feel so good to be home tho after that! I live near 89 and watched traffic at 11pm just crawling. I felt so awful for those people.
You don‚Äôt get it because even at 98% it‚Äôs a completely different experience than 100%. It‚Äôs not just the way the moon and sun look but the entirety of the world and sky changes completely. 98% feels like the sun is still out on a normal day, maybe a bit dim ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Look at any of these pictures here or of any total eclipse during totality. If yours didn‚Äôt look like that, then you didn‚Äôt have the same experience.¬†
Less than 100% totality and you can‚Äôt take off the protective glasses. 100% totality makes it safe to do so; and seeing the last sliver of sun disappear and then the darkness all around and the corona ejections around the black disc that is the moon; it‚Äôs an awe inspiring sight that transcends anything I‚Äôve seen or experienced before. A partial eclipse, even 98%, is like going to the sound and thinking you‚Äôve experienced the ocean. A partial eclipse is just not a very significant event. Whereas a total eclipse is one of the most significant events a person can experience. People don‚Äôt travel hundreds and thousands of miles to see the sun shrink through special glasses. They come to see the moon block out the sun with their naked eyes (or telescopes) and all the little, incredible details that are associated with that show. 98% totality is the preview to the main attraction. It is *not* tantamount to tuning an analog radio dial from 98% clear signal to 100% clear signal. Rather, it‚Äôs more like flipping a light switch. I hope that helps.

My friend kept saying "I really hope it comes back!!"
Right?? I felt like I was in a dooms day event.
Yeah. I can see how people banged pots and made noise to scare away the thing eating the sun! Absolutely the coolest thing I've ever seen.
Where I was it was silent until the sun started coming back and then everyone cheered.
The eclipse was one of the most beautiful and most eerie experiences of my life. We were on a secluded hilltop, forest all around, bright sun reflecting off the snow‚Ä¶ when it got dark, everything fell silent, the birds stopped chirping, the wind even seemed to settle. A 360 degree sunset all around and a black sky above with this fiery ring. I got chills.
It was weird.. like, as it got darker it didn't seem like normal dusk. It felt almost like you were wearing sunglasses. And then when it hit totality it was very suddenly dark, but looking out over the lake it looked like dusk. And the temp cooled very quickly. Then the second totality ended it was bright again, not quite full daylight but definitely bright, almost like nothing had happened. 

It was surreal, kind of difficult to explain. I was in the 90+% zone for the 2017 eclipse, and thought that was cool, but this was definitely different. My husband and I both couldn't believe how far some people traveled for this, but now we get it. I don't know how far I'd be willing to travel for one in the future, but we both agreed we'd consider it if the timing worked out. 

That said, some people don't really get excited by this kind of thing, so I imagine some were pretty underwhelmed. No big deal if it isn't someone's thing, so long as they don't shit on others for enjoying it.
It was the most amazing thing I have ever experienced. There are no words or pictures that can do it justice. Just mind blowing
It was like seeing something alien in the sky. When I saw it I let out a primal scream. Can‚Äôt be explained. You have to experience it.
It super hard to explain. I think different people like different things about the experience but watching the sky on lead in like a minute or two before alone is worth the price of admission. To me it looked like a giant storm was brewing but it was a perfect cloudless day.
It appears the answer is yes! Someone got a really high-definition shot showing the filament in detail: https://i.redd.it/dzlj2jrzmbtc1.jpeg
Hate to be that person but it‚Äôs astronomical, not astrological
There's one in Spain on August 12, 2026.  That eclipse will happen just before sunset, with the sun setting while still partially eclipsed.  Granted, Spain isn't a short trip from Vermont, but it could be attainable with a cheap flight and some serious advanced planning.
Genuinely feel bad for people like this. As if depriving themselves of the experience somehow sticks it to the "flatlanders".
Did you experience totality? Because if you only saw 99% or something I totally understand your reaction.
Cuz I can totally afford to travel lol
From Lawrence‚Äôs Massachusetts to Newport Vermont and back. We left at 3:30 and got home at 4:14am broüíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ my foot never left the breaks
No use in even trying to explain it to people with that kind of mindset lol. Let them continue on with their dreary lives
The 360 sunset blew my mind!! I didn‚Äôt remember this would happen. Also I was on a hill top, no trees, I saw the WHOLE RING and then deep purple above.

https://preview.redd.it/0x5n9u406dtc1.jpeg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=29878cc18cac5bcffe35e7ce435e0e9cd098be02
This was pretty much my experience! Hard to put into words aside from describing, but that's exactly what it felt like....
That‚Äôs fucking cool thanks for sharing
Wow! They're all along the left side. I thought the shadow bands were awesome as well. The whole thing was just ... metal.
Thank you, I am not actually into astrology except for funsies. Neat to know it's both!
It's actually both- it's incredibly significant in astrology whether others believe in it or not.
6 hour flight. You can get to Spain faster than you can get to Texas. Honestly, it's worth going just for the food!
Yeap!..
Like 98% to 100% is a completely diff experience !!!!!
lol, no I didn‚Äôt participate in the shit show.

Have you seen both? What‚Äôs the difference?
I can‚Äôt really either, but if there is a will, there‚Äôs a way! I figure it shouldn‚Äôt be too hard to save up in three years.
This is understated. I will never forget that image of a circular sunset on all horizons.
Surprisingly accurate
The difference between 99% and 100% is significant. 99% you will hardly tell there was even an eclipse. 100% becomes a visual phenomenon. Unless you are in the 100%, you have basically nothing to look at. 

With that said, the people saying this changed their life or they can‚Äôt stop thinking about it are freakin‚Äô nut jobs. Someone said they cried and vowed to better their life. Give me a break. 

It was a cool sight. Sunset all around you. Eye of Sauron staring down at you. I can see why our great ancestors thought god was angry or whatever. But it was a cool visual for a few minutes. Nothing that significant. Life moves on.
Yes I‚Äôve seen both. And even if one hasn‚Äôt seen both a little research goes a long way. Partial from 1%-99% you can only safely view through the filter of the glasses, and yes it‚Äôs cool to see the shape of the moon eclipsing the sun into a sliver, but at 100% you literally watch the shadow from the horizon engulf you and you are shrouded in darkness and everything looks like it‚Äôs in a blue/grey filter. You can remove your glasses & view the eclipse with the naked eye. You can safely view it through binoculars and telescope without filter too. That 100% makes a world of difference and it‚Äôs visually far more striking than any partial eclipse. It was one of the most surreal and amazing 2 minutes ever and I wish I could experience it again. It went by so fast.
My will to live has basically been non existent. And my confidence in myself is shot. I doubt I'll make it in three years haha
I got as close to the center line of totality as I could and, man, that was the fastest 3 1/2 minutes of my life. I honestly can‚Äôt account for where those minutes went. Felt like 30 seconds. So amazing.
Cool, I‚Äôm glad you enjoyed yourself.
Can We Normalize Passing Cars?
I got flipped off for passing a car going 48 in a 50 this afternoon. Straight section of road, dashed line, and nearly one mile of visibility with no oncoming vehicles. On other occasions, I‚Äôve had people floor it while I‚Äôm passing, which is beyond stupid. It‚Äôs not personal so don‚Äôt take it as an insult when someone passes you, they just want to go faster than you‚Äôre driving. It‚Äôs neither your responsibility nor is it within your authority to control other people‚Äôs driving. If someone is driving recklessly or dangerously, call the police. Otherwise simply let them go on their way while you go on yours. 

On a side note, if you have no intention of passing, don‚Äôt tailgate. Leave some space so others can pass safely. Also, maybe just don‚Äôt tailgate?
I was just in VT for a nice camping trip. I was unfamiliar with the roads and was often going 45 in a 50.¬†


I dont see what the big deal is, plenty of people passed me...all legally,¬† and when they did I moved over a little and slowed down a tiny bit so they could get back in lane faster.


No need to be rude about it.
Thank you for passing safely and not tailgating me.
If I don't floor it to match their speed when passing, subsequently blocking both lanes of traffic and increasing the likelihood of a fatal multi-car collision, how will they know that I am displeased by their criminal law breaking (going 5 over the speed limit)???

/s
PLEASE. Omg I just had the most frustrating drive through Rochester Gap and all the way to 89 stuck behind this masshole in a BMW. He would go SLOW AS FUCK on any kind of curve or turn where it wasn't straight. Like on the 50mph on RT 12 into Bethel he would go 55 on the straight so I couldn't pass then all the way down to fucking 35 on any kind of a corner. And then when the speed limit drops to 35 and then 25 in Bethel....he KEPT GOING 50. Just such an absolute moron. Man I wanted to pass him so many times but Rochester gap isn't great for that and at my one chance he was also only doing 2 mph under the speed limit and it felt like a dick move. Also as another example of what an absolute moron this guy was, when we got on 89 and the 2nd lane opened (1 lane closed due to construction for a bit as you get on the interstate) with no one else on the interstate but us, he immediately pulled into the left lane. Not passing anyone. No one in front. Just me behind who was about to pull into that lane to pass....

Also this doesn't have anything to do with passing but when I got back to WRJ and got off 89 by the McDonald's there was a truck in front of me who came to a complete stop before entering the roundabout which was completely empty. Its just so stupid....how do people not know how roads work?
Speeding up to prevent someone from passing should be easy attempted murder. Fuck any ego tripping loser who does it.

Had someone in front of me doing 40-45 in a 50 and when I made to pass on dotted yellow they get up to fucking 70 side by side with me. Are you serious?! What the actual fuck is wrong with people? It's not like I was tailgating either, I always hold distance - especially when I know there's a passing zone approaching. It makes the overtake much easier and safer anyways. The acceleration I was able to get in the gap is the only reason I could pass them because their car was way more powerful than mine. I still basically had to force my way back in the lane.

As a lifelong, multi generation Vermont native who has also spent some time living and driving in other states for work, this state has some terrible drivers.  But to be fair there‚Äôs no shortage of those in other states either.  Vermont‚Äôs lack of three lane highways really instigates a lot of the stupid behavior.  But my god, the amount of tailgating is insane.  I can be a bit aggressive on my daily commute but never tailgate.  But frequently have been going 80 in a 65 only to have an asshat hammer up on me as hard as possible in the passing lane.  Some folks just straight up looking to die and take others with them.

I mean‚Ä¶has nobody else in this state ever seen a deer cross the road or next to the road?  Shit can happen in an instant.  You cannot stop your vehicle at that speed in a car length of distance, you will be inside the vehicle in front of you in a heartbeat.
I‚Äôm not offended at all if someone passes me. In fact, I‚Äôm one of those ppl who will pull over and wave someone to go around me. I don‚Äôt need someone riding my ass unless it‚Äôs in a diff way, you know?
Seems normal enough in my neck of the woods; I get blown past by giant pickup trucks all the time whose drivers seem inordinately angry that I'm only going 5 over the speed limit. I don't care, they can do whatever small dicked things they want to do and I'll get out of their way because I want nothing to do with it.
My experience in VT has been if you‚Äôre not going 10+ over you will get passed on a double yellow. I see triple passes a lot. Everyone says VT drivers are slow but you all know how to haul ass.
I got pulled over for "tailgating" not too long ago. I got off the interstate, and the person in front of me was driving 15 mph under the speed limit. They would get up to 45 in a 50, then slow down to 35, then back up to 45 for miles. I finally had enough and was preparing to pass legally and pulled up on them as they slowed down again. As I went to go around them, a cop that was a few cars back lite me up. Thankfully, after explaining, he let me go.
Just got back from Sicily Italy and it‚Äôs really common for people to pass. Narrow roads and the dichotomy of very small engines versus bigger engines. A tiny Fiat chugging along at 55 k/h and a BMW whizzing by at 100 k/h. 

People just scootch over to let the faster cars pass. No harm no foul. I thought that was pretty cool.
As much as I LOVE Vermont, I absolutely HATE our drivers. I have gotten to the point that I just expect the actions. 

People driving 35 in a 50 (2A to Williston is really bad for this), People running red lights and not paying attention to the no turn on red signs (the amount of near collisions at 5 corners, or the multitude of people who plow through the red light at mall intersection.), the amount of people in downtown Burlington go around a stopped school bus, it's just ridiculous the amount of bad driving here. 

I understand 45 in a 50 isn't bad driving, but the reaction certainly is. 

The worse thing is, I've run into so many people who seem to want to speed up the moment I try and pass them... thankfully my car gets up and goes when I need it to, but for fuck sake, why couldn't they just go the speed limit before I try and pass them? 

TLDR: yeah, driving in Vermont can be shit sometimes.

Edit:  and don't get me started on the wrong way drivers lately. üòí
Also! I might pass you if you‚Äôre going 55‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not always about your speed. Sometimes it‚Äôs about the variation. I‚Äôm on cruise control. I appreciate that your a grown up and can speed, but when you‚Äôre going 62 sometimes and 40 others, it‚Äôs annoying as fuck
Im from Jersey, was there last month for vacation. I went the speed limit in 90% of areas, especially when it was raining hard. Locals would pass me from time to time and I did not think twice about it. Don't know why some people take it as a personal attack.
And if you're going slower than the speed limit on a winding road with low-visibility for oncoming cars, and you have a line of cars behind you, please pull over and let those cars pass.¬†
To be honest, I'm sometimes annoyed by how often I get passed, especially when I'm already going over the speed limit, but I see no reason to retaliate in any way. That just makes the situation worse. I generally try to hold my speed as they pass: that's what my Driver's Ed teacher taught me. Tailgating is definitely worse and should not be normalized.
Question. Did you ride their ass for 5 miles before doing so? I tend to go a little above and constantly have people on my bumper. You can pass on a double yellow in VT, but safely in a lot of places? I understand though, getting stuck behind some octogenarian doing 35 looking at leaves makes me feisty too.
It's perfectly legal to pass even on solid double yellow lines in VT. If you have visibility for the full section of road needed to pass, the only time it's illegal is if the road is marked "DO NOT PASS" or if the weather makes passing unsafe.


Anyone who gets pissed at being passed needs to learn how to fucking drive. I'd much rather let someone safely pass me than have an angry driver stuck behind me for miles. People take driving so personally.
Live right beside VT in MA same exact sort of area and ppl do get so butt hurt when u pass no matter what the situation is, I feel as long as I'm not passing and then in turn having them right up my ass then the pass is valid and ppl just be miserable out here
People are nuts, I passed one doing 25 in a 50, he started honking and swerving toward me. Almost called PD on him for reckless driving. Had an Audi do a similar thing this week.
Had a motorcycle going roughly seven under the speed limit do this to me‚Äî not sure what sort of point he was trying to make. Put my signal on and waited five beats, had plenty of time and space, but as soon as I got in the passing lane he revved his bike and accelerated to doing about 10 over and then proceeded to tailgate me. On a motorcycle. Think twice save a life‚Äî guess only applies one way.
Driving in Peru I‚Äôve never experienced this because it seems Americans are so damn narcissistic. If I‚Äôm passing you it has nothing do to with you don‚Äôt take offense I literally just want to get somewhere faster. People need to stop acting like it‚Äôs all about them.
[removed]
i was behind a car and we were both going 15 over and a guy came flying by at like 70 in a 35 the other day and almost crashed head on in the other lane
Last night on an empty stretch of road, a lone car in front of me was going 20mph in a 40. Gave him a few seconds to see if he‚Äôd speed up; he didn‚Äôt. So I passed him in the turn lane since no one was around... After which he does the exact same thing as me, absolutely BOOKING it just to get in front of me again before returning to a crawl. He was clearly just trying to piss someone off and it worked; what a petty asshole.
Forget it.  Vermont is the self-righteous driver capital of the world.  Overly courteous driving (read: yielding the right of way,  going 40 mph no matter the posted speed, and refusing to zipper merge cause it's for "city folk") is part of what they consider to be their exceptionalism.
Driving in Vermont is my least favorite part about living in this state. People with a green plate have deliberately slowed down in front of me and when I've gone to pass them will speed up. I do drive like I'm from NY ( NOT NYC AREA) but dq
People also often forget that passing on a DOUBLE YELLOW IS LEGAL HERE
Took the words out of my mouth. So damn frustrating. And just love the additional arms thrown into the air or being flipped the bird as you go past. 

I don‚Äôt care as long as someone is going to the speed limit, but if you‚Äôre under OR you can‚Äôt maintain your speed (45, then 52, then 48, etc) I‚Äôm going to pass you. It‚Äôs ok. It‚Äôs not an attack. And I‚Äôm not doing anything illegal, so chill out! 

Gah! This topic gets me so heated!! üòÜ
When I‚Äôm going the limit, or under, I‚Äôm happy when someone passes me. I don‚Äôt want any other vehicles near me, ever, because I have to pay attention to whatever you‚Äôre doing as well as myself. I‚Äôm someone that will slow and pull to the side a bit when I know you have opportunity to get by. 

Let‚Äôs all just arrive alive.
I got flipped off yesterday while behind a car in a 45 who slowed to ~35 on an uphill section and I came up close behind her. This bitch then brake checked me and threw up the bird. Like how the hell do you brake check and still think the other person is the asshole?
Having passed many many many cars in VT over the years, mostly in striped zones but also over plenty of double yellows when conditions are good, I have two rules:

1) Commit fully.
2) Don‚Äôt look back and make it count. 

VT is not bad - plenty of folks beep or flash me but I could care less. Generally they put up little actual resistance. In Maine though - I‚Äôve had folks STAY IN THE LEFT LANE during double lane hill pass areas with no attempt to pass slower traffic, only to ACCELERATE when I move right to pass them. Totally egregious. 

So - turbos only from now on.
My school bus growing up would pull over to let traffic pass when it was safe to do so.
This happened to me all the time going from Bethel towards Rutland in the fall when people are going 15 under the speed limit. Suddenly when it‚Äôs time to pass they speed up üò°
If you‚Äôre just passing that‚Äôs cool! Sometimes maybe I go slow. But when people are dicks about it, it‚Äôs legit scary. I was on route 7 to Bennington once and going 50. Some large truck starts tailgating and won‚Äôt pass even though they could. Finally we get to a part where they pass and I swear they tried like veering into my little car and the driver was honking their horn and you could kinda see him screaming. It was WEIRD. Some people are so rude it‚Äôs ok to just pass and not make it a whole thing if someone is to slow. Like you said basically lol.
Driving in Vermont is my least favorite part about living in Vermont. There are 3 types of drivers in this state:1 those that were born in VT and learned to drive here, 2. Transplants who learnedto drive elsewhere, 3. Vacationers/2nd home owners who include people that don't drive regularly. This makes an interesting social dynamic on the road which clearly does not always play well together.
Great post. Here in germany with the autobahn, passing is normalized and considered acceptable, but you can still be a dick about it, as many choose to do so. We even have cars that have stickers showing they are designed or permitted to only go a certain speed. It is common in my area to get stuck behind a tractor waiting for a safe moment to overtake. Just part of life on the road.

If you must go at or below the speed limit, please have a good reason and do not take it personally when someone passes. If possible, facilitate passing by either keeping to the right or even pausing your journey if needed.

Likewise, if you are allowed to pass (safely and without going too fast), you should do so, passing steadily and without aggressively accelerating or re entering the lane. There is NEVER a need to tailgate, be rude, or make a show of passing.


Drive safe and have a nice day!
I watched a truck pass us only to have the car in front of us speed, which made the truck really have to pound on the gas and was a lot closer to getting in an accident.

I slow down 5mph when someone is passing on 2 lanes.
There‚Äôs way too much misguided ego and pride out there.
[deleted]
I‚Äôm not sure when passing became frowned upon. It was normal 70-90‚Äôs and still seems no issue in Maine. I‚Äôm in Mass and woman was going 28 in a 40. I go by her, pull into a parking lot, she pulls in and starts taking pictures of my car and me. I go shopping, she‚Äôs gone, never heard anything. I assume she called PD and they told her to pound sand.
In my experience VT drivers are the second slowest in the north east, CT being slowest. Anyway, I agree with everything you've said. I come from the fastest state. lol.
A whole topic with nothing except honesty and factual insights. How refreshing. 

Yes. People need to stop driving so offensively.
I feel like cars and people are like dogs and fenced-in areas. So territorial
VT'ers always driving slow AF lol.

I got pulled over on my way back from VT for tailgating someone (w/ VT plates) for a split second before I signaled to pass them on a very long stretch of straight road. The person I passed was going like 35 in a 45. He let me go because he knew I was legally passing this person and I only tailgated for the fleeting moment before I changed lanes.
A lot of people in this state need to stop driving with their feelings.
Yall suck at slower traffic keep right. You come to NH and camp in the left lane. Worse is 89. You‚Äôll know you want exit 5 which is a left exit and so youll get on off 93 and sit there the whole time doing 68 in a 65. Like. Get over. Vermont has some of the slowest drivers ive ever seen
i had the exact same experience a few months ago. except he was going 10 under consistently.
All drivers need a vacation where they drive between cities in Europe. At 333333 kph a driver behind you will run you down flickering their high beams. Do or die. It was scary, and freeing. Driving in USA now feels more awful.
I am all for this, the only part just grinds my gears is when they pass me and then end up going slower than I was originally when they get in front of me.
‚ÄúIt is neither your responsibility nor is it within your authority,‚Äù and yet so many seem to ride their whole lives on that line claiming a form of NIMBYism for wherever they plant their feet or drive their cars. Their presence alone allows them to always police the area to their preferences. Odd.
And while we're discussing road behaviors,

This is Vermont. The interstate is two lanes, not four, and signs after every on ramp, drive in the right lane, except for passing.  

So many people driving barely 65 in passing lanes and never pulling over! Each one earning whatever salutes you choose!
I apologize to local drivers as they pass me in VT. I don‚Äôt know the roads well enough to drive like that. So I‚Äôll move over and wave as they rip past me. Like you said some people think they own the road.   You guys have such long stretches on single lane, you have to pass every once in a while.
I've always found it funny that many native Vermont drivers do 50 in a 30 or 45 in a 50 üòÇ
If it‚Äôs a legal maneuver then they have zero reason to be upset.  I don‚Äôt understand why slow drivers get so angry when people want to pass them.  Why wouldn‚Äôt they just pull over and facilitate a speedy and efficient exchange?
I pass people and flip them off for driving to slow all time
I have lived in VT for two years and recently drove from the NEK down to Maryland. It took a while for my city driving skills to return. It was slightly fun but oh so annoying dealing with crazy drivers. I am a defensive driver who occasionally will maneuver out of a knot of idiots. 

What I appreciate about Vermont is the lack of competition on the road. There‚Äôs no one-upmanship, everyone‚Äôs just going somewhere and they will get there when they get there. Pass when they need to. It‚Äôs out of state license plates that tend to hog the passing lane, rather than tucking back in to the right lane. 

My boys are 8 and as passengers, really began to understand the different styles of driving on this trip. 

As soon as we crossed the VT border, traffic thinned out and I relaxed. 

One of my boys has started making jokes about Jersey drivers ü§£
I get your frustration.  Passed a Subaru going 5 mph below limit, and as I pass he nails it.  Lots of idiots.p
Only state in the country where it's legal to pass on a double line and people do it frequently. "Can we normalize this"
Wtf do you mean ‚Äúcan we normalize passing cars?‚Äù  It‚Äôs been normal since there have been cars and roads.  If you passed someone in a legal and respectful way only to get flipped off,  that is an abnormal situation that no degree of normalization will address.  Some drivers are just bad.
I‚Äôve noticed this too. From NH and moved closer to the VT border. Like, it‚Äôs nothing personal, I am just driving faster no need to get all weird.
I agree, not just for the convenience of the other driver but for everyone‚Äôs safety. The more reckless and crazy the person behind me the more I‚Äôm motivated to move over for them. 

And please don‚Äôt use tailgating as a message to mean speed up. Tailgating is way too normalized, it‚Äôs so dangerous. Seeing five cars in the passing lane all going faster than the right lane but all tailgating gives me so much anxiety. One unexpected move from an animal or another car and everyone is fucked. Two seconds behind is what I learned and practice. 

Too many people like to play games and can‚Äôt conceptualize how deadly cars are.
Getting insecure because a random car is passing you is just pathetic, I genuinely can't understand the mentality at all. If someone is going faster than me, I just pull over a bit and never think about it again.
I got flipped off passing someone maxing out at 48 on the sandbar where it is 50. Followed them from the ferry all the way to the sandbar and consistently drove 3-5 mph under the speed limit. But when I pass on a dotted yellow line I‚Äôm the asshole? If you can‚Äôt keep up with the flow of traffic pull over to let people pass or surrender your license
I‚Äôd rather normalize being patient and driving respectfully. I don‚Äôt go around flipping the bird, but I wish I could hear the bird flippers side of the story. Why would they do that just for passing?
You can legally pass over a double yellow in VT either way.

For the a holes that speed up: come up with enough speed to just slip past them. Don‚Äôt slow down behind them then speed up. If you‚Äôre far behind them then back off like you‚Äôre slow then over take with surpassing speed
They imagine they are the ‚Äúleader of the pack‚Äù
Vermont is the state that I have been passed the most. Massholes have a reputation, but Vermont is the one state I will be going 9-mph over the speed limit (maximum speed I will do where I don‚Äôt know where the police hide),and I will get passed by any type of car or person. Double yellow line or not. For reference, I‚Äôm a left lane driver who is progressive not aggressive, definitely in the top 10 percent of speed. No accidents, and no speeding tickets in the last 20 years. Knocked on wood.
I was in VT yesterday and had quite a few "Karen Cops" doing 30 in a 50.   Miles and miles of double yellow road (HWY 100).   When we finally got to a passing zone they sped up and tried to race me when I passed them.   Vermont you can do better.   Don't compete with the Massholes!
To be fair, it's very difficult to legally pass someone going 2 under without breaking the law. You might be ok with speeding, but you really shouldn't be. I agree everyone does it all the time, but that doesn't make it legal.
I consistently have people speed up when I pass on my motorcycle, which is hilarious because my bike is A LOT faster than the vast majority of cars out there‚Ä¶
I agree with you! Interestingly, I'm originally from MA and I feel like passing is much more normalized in VT than it is there. In MA, I think it's a rule that you have to flip someone off while screaming while you pass them lol üôÑ
People in this country act like passing is an act of aggression towards them. I'm speeding up because that's how you safely pass someone. I can't tell you how many times I've had people get aggressive towards me passing them. Chill out. And move over.
This is exactly why now everytime i pass im full throttling it.
Were you riding their butts for a while??  We Vermonters had to be stuck behind a slow driver.  Was the driver young??  You may have just caused a nervous reaction. I‚Äôm aggressive on the roads myself.
People in Vermont and NH are the worst for this shit. I don't know how many times I have been going down 5 or 10 trying to get home after work and some jerk off is going 40 in a 55 and will not just pull over on one of the many pull offs along the road and let the line of cars pass. If you want to drive slow, drive slow but let people go around you. What's worse is these douches in spandex biking clothes with fake sponsors that take up driving lanes on a weekday. A shirt with company logos that you bought is not a sponsorship it is an advertisement for the company. It is infuriating I hope they all fall off their bikes and scrape their knees really bad.
When ya stop right in front of them, minutes later, is when it gets weird.
I got a fat speeding ticket for doing the EXACT same thing. Went a little over 50mph just to pass the car and got pulled over. Happened just into VT past the NY border

Safe passing > tailgating
Was there a reason they were going under the limit? Around here you‚Äôre an a-hole if you‚Äôre not going 5 - 10 over the limit.
[removed]
Preach
I‚Äôm sick of living here man. Are these people just on vacation year round now? Do they live here? And now we‚Äôve got em here long enough for their plates to turn green so they‚Äôve blended in to the normal traffic. I‚Äôm leaving as soon as I can and it‚Äôs not even the price and taxes it‚Äôs the people taking over the place I used to feel comfortable in
[deleted]
You‚Äôre telling folks not to control other people‚Äôs driving and then proceed to try and control other people‚Äôs driving ü§£.
1. Since it is legal to pass in double yellow when visibility and road conditions allow, the variations in speedometer indications become significant.

2. There are a significant number of people, often with a 3 or 4 digit plate numbers, who consistently drive 5 miles below the posted limit.  I assume they have not been involved in any accidents but have caused a few. 

3. The best anyone can do it to drive defensively, allow others to   drive as they see fit, and not feel offended over other's idiocies.
Some have people have nothing better to do than lash out at others over nothing. People in general have become super aggressive for some reason. 

However, if you were (as some do) driving, to coin a phrase ‚Äúdriving up someone‚Äôs ass‚Äù (hehe) then passed them, then you might have deserved the gesture based on that, rather than the passing.
Two miles an hour under the posted speed limit, you should have strafed their car with gunfire as you sped by on your hurry to get . . . somewhere important? People on Shelburne Road go blasting by so they can get to that red light 5 seconds faster.
I agree with everything you said except the first part. I don‚Äôt think speeding up when someone is passing you is right in any way, shape or form. I also don‚Äôt think tailgating is helping anyone‚Äôs case, if anything it only makes it worse. But 48 in a 50? Really? That‚Äôs what ur passing? It‚Äôs called a speed limit for a reason dude. 50 is supposed to be the limit. At absolutely no point in ur life is it worth driving the extra 2+ miles an hour to get somewhere potentially a few mins faster.
Speed limits are unconstitutional¬†
Depends on the situation. If I'm going the speed limit, why are you blowing past me? The limit applies to you too, all so we can meet up at the next light anyways.

I recently ran into a situation where someone had to get past me because the law didn't apply to them. When I caught up to them they were behind a group of three cars and I guess their patience was growing thin so they decided to blow by the group as well. Too bad they weren't bright enough to realize the group was slowing down because the lead car was turning left, right where the guy in a rush was flying through.
You were probably tailgating before then. Also, if you did pass at 48 in a 50, you were speeding.
AFAIK, it is always illegal to go over double yellow lines to pass someone who is going at or over the speed limit (it's no longer permitted under the exemption). 

I have no problems passing someone going slower than the speed limit, or someone passing me if I'm going slow, but tailgating me when I'm already probably going too fast is annoying. And when that happens I often don't have the option to pull over to let to let the tailgaters pass and slowing down often just makes them more aggressive tailgaters.
Yeah I mean you should never be passing someone on a one lane road if they're going two miles under the speed limit. If they're driving slow enough to cause an unsafe traffic buildup, sure go for it, but you shouldn't pass someone just because you want to drive over the speed limit.

Edit: y'all love to whine lol
If they were going 48 you would have had to speed to pass them. 50 (the speed limit) is the MAXIMUM speed you can travel. Not the minimum. 48 is perfectly okay.
Riding that ass. Annoying. Are you a woman?  Mostly women tailgate. Dangerous. The northeast has a problem with this.
If you pass someone going 2 mph under the speed limit YTA
Sounds like a typical drive in NH.  VTers rarely have this problem, and will often pull over if they feel you pressing even a little.
Old people
If you have to speed to pass its an issue on your end tbh.
You must be a flatlander.
I mean you can legally pass on double yellow in vermont as well.
Great attitude. It is absolutely not a big deal.
Way too many people (and it‚Äôs usually NY/NJ/CT plates doing this) actually speed up when you try to pass them. I appreciate that you‚Äôre actually decent, I just wish more people had that attitude.
You‚Äôre welcome!
lol a Honda Fit floored it uphill yesterday as I passed.  would've been funny if it wasn't so sad.
I feel this so deeply lol. I‚Äôve been in a similar situation so many times.
This actually is my most hated type of driver.  Except in my version, their stock speed is 40.  Route 100, Village of Stowe, Straightaway down a hill, it don't matter.....this flatlander is just gonna go 40 the whole way to Newport
No public relations to provide video or audio instructions to the public.  Same as turning lanes.   A lot of people have never left the region and experienced these in urban places. They have no clue what to do. VTtrans for the fail.
I live in MA. This tracks with my experiences.
It‚Äôs never a dick move to pass a bad driver
You need to lay off the coffee .
Not to mention if my choice is going head on or fucking slamming into the side of someone, I'm slamming in to the side of their dumbass.
Someone did that to me once on RT 15 getting close to the road to Smuggs right after the curves in the road by the bridge where it gets straight. They did this to me with oncoming traffic (which was very far away when I started the pass) too. Absolutely insane.
This is why I appreciate driving a vehicle that's faster than your average econobox Subaru/Toyota etc. Try to fuck with me while I'm not doing anything to bother you, I can just drive away because I'm faster.
Agreed but doing 70 in a 50 and taking corners over the white line and then hitting someone who‚Äôs into the breakdown lane to pull off into a secondary road is bullshit. Maybe keep your car in the lane of travel and slow the fuck down on roads with a speed limit of 50. I do 55 to 60 on a bunch of roads tested at 50 and have been hit twice now this year while pulled over turning into a secondary road. Both times 100% their fault both times on rear dash cam halfway into the break down lane. People just drive too fast and suck driving in VT. The last time the idiot had no insurance so going to take their tax returns and ive had their wages garnished till they‚Äôve paid, if they don‚Äôt want to pay then you can have their license suspended indefinitely also any money they win for the rest of their lives will go to recoup the total loss and medical bills. People need to slow down a lot.
No kidden!    I had a Subaru do this to me yesterday..    Thankfully I'm in a 1965 Shelby Cobra...   It didn't exactly pan out they way they thought it would.
This is why I long for a stupid, loud, fast car. Makes em think twice about trying to pull that shit.
Tiny dick energy.
Attempted murder is a hell of a stretch.
That‚Äôs why you should carry a nice sized rock in your car. When they are side by side let it loose into their wheel well. It‚Äôll bang around a couple seconds between the fender and wheel üòÜ
Why are you in the passing lane?  Are you passing or camping?
actually the east coast has worse drivers than the west coast in my extremely subjective opinion. but ive almost had several terrible accidents with folks that didn‚Äôt even flinch or seem to be aware of the catastrophe they almost caused. not even a honk will stir them from their profound stupor.
I totally agree. There is no need to come up aggressively on anyone, much less someone who is going well above the speed limit. Straight to jail!
Once they're in front of me and going faster they aren't my problem anymore.
Yeah op has clearly never driven on 22 or 7 lfmao. Nothing like seeing some f250s headlights appear right in front of you suddenly because some ye ye boy decided to overtake a line of 10 cars on a blind corner.
This is me too! Haha. I‚Äôd like to see patience normalized over all else
a truck nearly ran me off the road last winter.  why?  well the salt truck was in front of us salting the roads and we didn't want our shitty car to get any shittier.  truck's side panel was rusted almost entirely away too.  

they could just pass and get on with their lives.
In my experience people either go 10+ the speed limit or -10 the speed limit, and no where in-between.
It‚Äôs an interesting dynamic because many Vermonters do drive slow so some of the drivers who want to go faster get frustrated and impatient then take risks. It‚Äôs not worth it and that‚Äôs not me, though I do understand the frustration. The post-Covid reality is different. The average speed has noticeably increased, especially on I-89, and the cops are generally nowhere to be found. 

Idk, Vermonters are generally decent drivers compared to our neighboring states. I just needed to rant because I caught a bird for doing nothing wrong.
I just came back up to NH from a trip and drivers near there drove WAY slower on the backroads compared to VT. They were driving 40-50 MPH on some pretty straight-ish roads. Where I live in VT, people want you to go 55-60 minimum on roads like that.
tell that to the crvs and fucking foresters of waterbury to waitsfield section of rt 100
The only New England state that could be said to have slow drivers is Maine. It's not even close. Still I wouldn't call them slow. Go to the midwest if you want slow drivers. Vermont drivers look like CT or MA drivers compared to the midwest.
Thankfully he was reasonable! I hate being behind people who drive like that and would have done the same thing.
I grew up in Vermont but have lived most of my adult life in Italy. I'm completely shocked to hear that this is not normal and that someone could get upset at being passed.
Bingo! I‚Äôm patient enough to just follow if someone is going a few miles per hour over, even if it‚Äôs not my desired speed, so long as they are consistent. Especially on the interstate, I don‚Äôt care what speed someone goes, just keep it the SAME speed.
This is the most annoying thing ever. People need to learn to use their cruise control.
If and when there‚Äôs a safe area to do so. No need to endanger one‚Äôs self for the convenience of others.
Amen!
In California, if you have 5 cars behind you in that way, you're legally obligated to move over.
[deleted]
Agreed. If someone is passing me and it‚Äôs sketchy, I actually slow down. I‚Äôm not looking to get involved in a multi car crash.
I did not. I caught up to them right at the beginning of the passing area. Point taken though and I wouldn‚Äôt have been surprised or posted had that been the situation.
or hills, intersections, curves, and railroad crossings if i remember correctly
I didn't know this. That'll explain the DO NOT PASS signs deep in double yellows. I always thought, "Well duh."
Exactly right. Everyone feels the need to be the main character but none of us are.
That‚Äôs exactly right. I respect cars in front of me who are going slower than I want and I don‚Äôt tailgate and I never take unnecessary risks when I pass. But when it‚Äôs safe, and I do, just give me the same respect.
That‚Äôs a completely different situation from what I‚Äôm talking about. Fuck that guy.
Ugh. People like that are the worst. Like the a-holes that break check on interstates. Like, what do they think will happen to them if the car behind them hits them at 65mph?
Deleted
Have you even been to NH?   VT drivers are far superior to our eastern neighbors, who take pride in clogging up the road doing exactly the speed limit.   I hate driving in NH.
D.C./NOVA drivers of the North. If you lived in northern VA you would lose your mind at how stupid, arrogant, and entitled they are. VT are slower and more in the way, VA/DC drivers are just pure cancer. They‚Äôll chase you down to a back parking lot to scold you how you shouldn‚Äôt beep at them for getting mad with how they just plowed right through your lane just because. Fine, I get out to brawl and let‚Äôs go then they pull the professional victim card. MFers all
I love Vermont but that‚Äôs fucking hilarious. And true.
I actually back off a bit then floor it while still behind the vehicle that I intend to pass. It gives me a chance to abort if the situation changes while minimizing my exposure to the oncoming lane when I commit. And I have a twin turbo engine too so that helps. Highly recommend.
I've spent my summer on motorcycles, fast ones. Works well for when you don't have time for that turbo lag. 

This morning I caught the stand still traffic backed up miles north of exit 16 for the 2 car crash that happened on the south end of the Winooski bridge. The bike needs airflow or the temps climb to 225f and then the frame gets hot enough to cause a burn. Once the fuel in the tank gets hot it starts missing and doesn't want to idle. If I shut it off or it stalls it doesn't want to restart.

So, I lane split at a relaxed 15mph. Most traffic didn't care  at all, a few cars made extra room (thank you), and a couple vehicles angrily honked at me as I passed. 

Sorry I'm not stuck in traffic with you. I don't want to cook as I straddle an infernal combustion engine and I don't want to be run over as the driver behind me gets distracted and plays on their phone. One of the most dangerous places for a bike to be is sandwiched between two multi-ton crumple-zoned protective cages. The only crumple zone I have is my ribcage. 

I don't get mad though, they just have no idea what the implications of sitting in traffic are.
That‚Äôs the worst. It‚Äôs like the people who go 80 on the highway until they‚Äôre passing someone then they slow to 0.5 mph faster than the car they‚Äôre passing. Thankfully that type of driver is rare in VT but they‚Äôre rampant in other states.
Great points. There‚Äôs also the college students for half the year üòµ‚Äçüí´
Haha, unless they're going egregiously slow, in which case a stern disapproving look at the other driver while you pass them is warranted.
There‚Äôs way too much of that around these parts.
I drove in Italy and it was a very similar experience.
Indeed it is. Nobody is the main character but so many people think that they are.
I have a theory that about half of Vermonters have just two speeds to drive. One for the interstate which is 62-67, and one for literally every other road which is 37-45.
That‚Äôs exactly what I do when I‚Äôm running slow due to towing or a fully loaded rental van. It‚Äôs not difficult to move over.
The answer is Ego... They feel personally attacked that someone might want to drive differently than they do, and as though they're being told they made the wrong choice for going slow. Can't stand being sunconciously "told" they're wrong, so they get upset.
Oh for sure. I‚Äôll take VT drivers over any mid-Atlantic states‚Äô drivers any day. That said, there‚Äôs still room for improvement here and way too many drivers take it personally when they are passed.
It‚Äôs so stupid because if something happens, they‚Äôll be right in the middle of it.
OP said dashed line
It‚Äôs deeper than that in VT. It‚Äôs like there‚Äôs an unwritten rule that you‚Äôre never supposed to pass someone.
It's actually more common in vt than anywhere else imo. Like it's pretty rare to get passed on a double line elsewhere. Here I'll be cruising 65 in a 50 and some guy will overtake me in a blind curve.
Exactly! It‚Äôs literally the easiest thing to do.
Bingo. I was also in the Islands when I experienced what I posted.
Because they took being passed personally. I was a teenager once and I drove like an asshole. That was not the case today. There was no other reason than his pride.
This is the way.
My wife and I call them parade leaders
That‚Äôs strange. I drive the same way, exactly, and I almost never get passed. We must be in different parts of the state.
I hate 100 for this exact reason.
I agree with you in principle but if you understood all the safety factors that go into the posted speed limit, you‚Äôd agree that the roads are still safe at higher speeds with the caveat that drivers need to be focused on driving and only driving.
I definitely did not tailgate at all. Had I, I would have taken the bird and moved on.
Yeah, I don‚Äôt really care about that. If I‚Äôm passing someone near where I know I might have to stop, it‚Äôs only because they were going way under the speed limit. I will actively seek eye contact in that scenario.

I‚Äôve been driving in Vermont for 30 years. What I described has always been an issue. I‚Äôm with you about non-Vermonters being a problem because they buy up properties as second homes, but VT drivers have always been kind of bad.
Had I done that, I‚Äôd accept it and I wouldn‚Äôt have posted.
What a weird thing to get from my post.
Agreed on all except that I have a 4 digit plate. You can pay a one time fee of $15, or that‚Äôs what it was when I did it, and get in a waiting list. It only took a couple weeks and I got one below 1400. Yes, I feel special üòé
I totally agree with you. I‚Äôll accept a bird if I‚Äôm being a jerk (which I try not to be). This guy just got offended for no reason other than I passed him.
You do you and let him do him.  That way everybody gets along.
Rural roads with straightaways that are marked 50, traveled 60, and someone is doing high 48.. that‚Äôs not a crazy pass. That was half of my younger days living near a main rural road that was normally fast with the occasional pokey person lol. If there‚Äôs space, and it‚Äôs a safe pass, what‚Äôs the issue?
Not always true. I bet about 50% of the time I make the green light and continue on, significantly cutting my commute time, while you get stuck at the red. That also allows me to make other green lights further ahead, again cutting my commute time. If I want to take the gamble, that's my choice. Just do your own thing and let me do mine.
Point taken but who says I only wanted to go 50? Cops give you 10 mph nearly universally and I generally take them.
Haha! I disagree but I love this take!
Why?
It doesn‚Äôt depend on the situation as I‚Äôm talking about passing safely. You‚Äôre basically saying that the speed you drive needs to be acceptable to everyone behind you because you‚Äôre driving at what you perceive to be the correct speed. You are who I‚Äôm ranting about.
I was not tailgating at all. I caught up with him at the beginning of the passing zone. And yes, I was speeding. But my whole point is that it was not his (nor is it your) business. You don‚Äôt get to enforce traffic laws. Like I said, if someone is being reckless, call the police. I do not drive recklessly so just let me be on my way without the superiority complex.
You can pass on a dbl yellow as long as there are no signs stating it as a no passing zone.
![gif](giphy|GXKK71oMMtBPu8ffUW)
Maybe not, but also, nobody should give AF is someone wants to pass them, regardless of speed limits.  This isn‚Äôt NH, leave it to the cops to enforce laws.
You sir, are the problem.
Just don't worry about why people are passing. You aren't driving their car or living their life.
I'm not sure you've noticed, but in a lot of places, typical average driving speed is at least 5-10mph over the speed limit. Most of the time you won't even get pulled over for that unless the cop has some other reason for wanting to stop you (DUI check, seatbelt, inspection, etc.) many of the speed limited were implemented decades ago when cars were much less safe, with longer stopping distances and poorer handling. If you feel uncomfortable with someone passing you going 10 over, you might want to reconsider driving altogether.
I applaud your comment, but you‚Äôre going to be massively downvoted by the crappy Vermont driver cartel that runs this sub.
Ok nerd ü§ì
48 is perfectly OK. Just don't get mad or a power complex when someone else doesn't want to do that and safely passes you.
No, I was not ‚Äúriding that ass‚Äù. I came up to him at the start of the dashed lines and passed him. That‚Äôs the beginning and end of the story. Also, I included a note about tailgating so you‚Äôve got the wrong person.
Ok buddy. Make sure to keep those tags on your mattresses.
If you're going under the speed limit and get upset that someone wants to do the speed limit, YTA.
This guy goes 2 mph under the limit
Um, I‚Äôm pretty sure your advice is kinda dangerous. Either pass or don‚Äôt pass, but if you do pass, it‚Äôs way safer to get it over with as quickly as possible. 

It‚Äôs the same as when you‚Äôre passing a big truck on 89. If you take your time, you‚Äôll spend way too long in their blind spot and might get crunched like a cockroach. I see dummies just sitting right in 18 wheelers blind spots all the time. That‚Äôs a good way to get killed. Even in the snow, I‚Äôll speed up to make the pass safer.
It‚Äôs me, hi, I‚Äôm the problem it‚Äôs Early-Boysenberry596.
Lol because only flat landers know where the gas peddle is?
Good one üôÑ
Is that true? What‚Äôs the point of the lines then? Just to let you know where it might be safer?
The cops might still give you a ticket for crossing the double yellow. I've seen it happen. Doesn't hold up in court because it IS legal to pass on a double yellow but I've still seen a few (maybe 2 or 3) of my friends get a ticket for it then they contested it and it was dismissed. Cops are dicks.
Only if the person you're passing is going slower than the speed limit.
Naw, Vermonters absolutely love this crap as well. Probably more than flatties in my experience. Old people driving 10 under for miles will speed up to 75 and try to kill you using the family in the oncoming lane as the weapon rather than suffer the indignity of being passed.
CT people love to camp in the passing lane and take offense if you try to pass them. Very self absorbed.
I was in a similar situation on my way towards Rochester earlier in the day too. Also a masshole. On the way back with the BMW guy I was just like really fucking AGAIN
??? Because I'm mad at a guy for driving significantly slower than the average speed of travel on a section of road. And who also drives incredibly inconsistent and unpredictable, the most dangerous ways to drive out there other than like insane speeding. 

I'm a consistent and predictable driver and I don't speed around like a psycho I just drive the speed most people drive through sections of road sometimes that happens to be 5 or a little more over the limit.
Good point
Braking hard & dropping back into your lane would be the smartest choice, but it seems like you opted out of that early on.
Yikes dude. With oncoming traffic? Actual psychopath behavior.

Mine was on 100 between Stowe and Morrisville. No other cars in sight for the whole event, fortunately.
Recently got an EV, and it makes passing in the dotted yellow or rare passing lane so easy.
Downvoted for saying I like to pass safely and have a good enough car under me to get out of harm's way if needed? Haha typical...
*Laughs in 300 HP twin turbo German engineered sports sedan
Lol. I want a dildo cannon to stick a dildo to their window. Either they pull over and fuck off to remove it or they chase me with a dick flopping out of the side of their car.
Passing, not camping.  Regardless, tailgating at that speed is stupidly dangerous (and really at any speed).
Oh, I‚Äôve been on 7 and 22 plenty. I had someone in a diesel pickup role coal on me for passing in one of the truck passing lanes (2 lanes one direction) on 7 near ferrisburg. He was going 42 in a 50.
There‚Äôs nothing that drives me nuts more than some yocal that drives his pickup like it‚Äôs a race car. Like seriously dude, it‚Äôs a truck, it‚Äôs not fast, a Toyota Corolla can outrun it in a roll race‚Ä¶
Have you seen those strips of lights in front of newer jeeps as well as* big (not utility) pick up trucks having bright white headlights on the back of their truck!
Both of those roads need mandatory pull offs for vehicles that have four or more cars behind them. I‚Äôm surprised there aren‚Äôt more fatalities with the way people drive on them.
You gotta do the +10 cause you know inevitably theres gonna be a -10 measing your drive up üòÇ
> The post-Covid reality is different. The average speed has noticeably increased, especially on I-89, and the cops are generally nowhere to be found.

And how much does that speed increase affect safety on the road?

> As of August 24th, there have been 41 crash fatalities on Vermont's roads in 2024.  There were 48 deaths at this point last year.  The 10-year average is 40.
I‚Äôve been screaming at my windshield everyday on the way to work for years about this exact issue. I‚Äôm fucking tired of it man. And it‚Äôs obviously distracted driving at least as far as I can tell with the drifting and veering back and speeding back up. Genuinely awful driving behind these blob cars with city folk behind the wheel
driveways are abundant. no need for the concern trolling‚Ä¶
Obviously, you pull over where it's safe.¬†
What do you normally do when you see cyclists?
oh yea definitely. just sharing an anecdote
Maybe that's a side effect of driving a Subaru. I had an old (2002? '03? so boring, I can't remember) Outback briefly & I found myself driving about 40 mph everywhere (greater Seattle area at the time). 

I sold it to a friend in Portland, where Subaru ownership is nearly mandatory.
[Lol.](https://i.imgur.com/XS5LK.gif)
I just had a moron with a BMW from MA in front of me going 55 in the 50 on the straights and 35 on any kind of curve in the road. And then when we got to town and it dropped to 35 and then 25....he kept going 45-50.
"Have you even been to NH?"

No, I don't have a passport.
Don‚Äôt blame them. They‚Äôll ticket you for doing 32 in a 30 zone there.
NH drivers love to park it in the left lane like it is their god given right
Even comparing DC/NOVA drivers to Vermont is a joke.
It's the Old Bay; it brings out our wild side...

Yep I sometimes do a similar thing depending on situation. 

Which car? I‚Äôm in a lowly Mazda 3 but honestly it‚Äôs plenty of scoot when I need it thanks to the manual and their impressive torque curve.
My current car isn‚Äôt turbo but it‚Äôs a manual Mazda and passing maneuvers are a dream. Next one will have a spool (and lose the stick unfortunately) but these days turbo lag is petty minimal. 

Either way I agree with you - bikes filtering with caution should never be an issue. People just wanna be mad. But yet - they can‚Äôt move their own ass out of the left lane ever so fuckem. I gave up trying to be nice years ago. Safe? Hell yes? Nice? Nope. My speed is my speed. No reason to be stuck waiting behind some one slower when conditions are prime for cruising.
Fair but overtakes are far more common here than elsewhere because of this imo.
Vermont has the weirdest driving culture. Like yeah people from Mass are aggressive as fuck, but at least their foolishness is predictable.
People pass plenty in my experience, but there‚Äôs not as much chance to pass as there is in other states because the winding roads have more double lines than other places.  
Also, it may be legal to pass with double lines here, but that‚Äôs not something many people will know if they haven‚Äôt moved here long or are from out of state.
Yeah I feel this. I've had 2 times where I attempted to pass people going 40ish in a 50 and then they turned into psycho murder road ragers. 

One time they sped up to 70 and almost ran me into oncoming traffic and the other time they let me pass but then immediately started doing 70 on my ass running my speed up trying to get away from the psycho.

Like motherfuckers you know you're going 40 in a 50 wtf is wrong with you. Both cars had VT plates.
I get passed in VT so much more than in MA. It‚Äôs not even close. 

I‚Äôm 100% fine with getting passed provided the passer doesn‚Äôt ride my ass beforehand, and passes when it‚Äôs clear and safe.

I‚Äôm less of a fan when drivers make bad decisions when passing- which I‚Äôve seen way more often than I‚Äôd like. Specifically, cars attempting to pass when they have not enough visibility or clearance to oncoming traffic. My wife had to pull off on the shoulder of 22A once this year to avoid a head-on. Why is it worth endangering lives to save a few seconds or minutes? 

Another recent experience: I took a left onto 22A. Looked ahead and saw a passing vehicle coming right at me- I hadn‚Äôt seen it, and it hadn‚Äôt seen me, because of the size of the truck it was passing. Fortunately it was able to complete the pass. It wasn‚Äôt super-close, but it also wasn‚Äôt not close.

Bottom line for me is that the risk vs reward of passing is generally poor. Yes, there are plenty of times when passing is pretty safe and low risk. But there are plenty of times when it‚Äôs not, and people try to pass anyway. That‚Äôs the crap that scares me.
What. We are the only state that allows double line overtakes. Every time I drive down 22a I feel the need to watch out for oncoming traffic in my lane because dumbfucks in f250s like overtaking entire lines of cars on blind curves
Strange cause I see them pass over double yellow all the time.
Seems like a common occurrence up in that area with limited areas to pass and an ‚Äúisland time‚Äù mentality
I agree speed limits are conservative. But they are still hard limits as defined in law.
Not trying to be difficult or pick a fight, but it‚Äôs all right there.  One follows directly after the other.  That‚Äôs the reason I commented.  FWIW, I agree it‚Äôs shitty for someone to flip you (or anyone) off for passing, but if they were going 48 mph in a 50 mph limit, is it really necessary to pass them for that extra 2 mph?
While I agree...pass when able and safely...ive seen alot of the opposite since covid lockdowns came off.

The pavement princesses making unsafe situations in a speeding ball of steel, that can easily take out everything around it if something were to happen..all so you can make it to work 30 seconds faster...is my problem.

Suddenly, peoples "problems" become others with possible manglement or death for what? Getting to work 5 minutes earlier?
That's a curious notion. What I perceive to be the correct speed is the posted speed. If the correct speed was different, it would be posted, you weren't aware of that? When you pass me and blow down the road, and I see you sitting on the side of the road a minute later with flashing lights on you, was your perceived speed still correct?
But you posted it making it our business. If you can‚Äôt accept comments, then you shouldn‚Äôt post.

Was it at night, were you in a big truck with high beams on? Do you have blinding white halogen lights?
It‚Äôs not ‚Äúenforcing the laws‚Äù to go the speed limit.

It‚Äôs following the laws.

All the rest is just opinion on driving.

Please try to understand that distinction.
I've been pulled over on Moscow road for going 7 over before. If you see a green plate speeding and then they suddenly start following the rules in a certain town. I'd highly reccomended not passing them. Certain towns don't f around.  Those are honestly the areas I get overtaken the most.
Driving Cartels run most of Reddit for some reason.

Since when did sitting in traffic and crying about people going 48 on a 50 become ‚Äúculture‚Äù?
amiwrongtho
If you're going 48 in a 50...and there's a double yellow line beside you...you CAN'T be "safely passed".

They'd have to speed, and cross the double yellow to pass you. That's not safe. Where did you get your license lol
You speeding to pass and getting flipped off makes me the problem?
Vermonters don‚Äôt pass vermonters.
It's a bit vague, yeah. The law basically says "when deemed safe" you're allowed to. I think it's because there's so much farm equipment on the roads.
recommend passing zone.  yes likely safer 

but absolutely is true.
As far as I can tell, the lines on VT 14, 15, and 16 have no correlation whatsoever with safe or unsafe passing zones.  I suspect that the guy on the line painting truck just switched from double yellow to single dashed yellow whenever he was running low on paint.
Yes in VT it is legal to pass on a double yellow line. The dotted yellow line is to let you know where it is ‚Äúsafe‚Äù to pass
Been driving in Vermont especially the NEK for over 30 years now. At some point prolly about 20 years ago the state got rid of a lot of dotted lines.  
There's one place on my daily drive that I had to agree with [them.You](http://them.You) had a split second to size up the situation and floor it if you wanted to make sure.I did it often enough I was confident in my decision. Now I'm retired so in no hurry to get anywhere. Still mumble under my breath at people who drive 35 in a 50.
The big difference is if your in an accident and your over a double yellow it's always your fault no matter what
It has origins surrounding farm equipment. But as written applies universally. Only caveat is if you try it and fuck up you‚Äôre going to be held fully responsible.
Yep. Plus, you're still not allowed to pass in certain areas. Curves, hills, too close to an intersection. 

I've gotten a ticket for this in VT before. I figured he was gonna pop me for speeding during the pass, but it was the passing laws for some reason.
Yes, exactly. The double yellows are a ‚Äúrecommendation‚Äù not to pass.
Lumpy, it's a jk - ask Wally or the Beaver..
In the middle of winter with no leaves on the trees visibility might be drastically longer than in the height of summer when leaves and foliage block a long view.
That's always the condition of passing whether it's double yellow or not. Passing is not an acceptable reason to exceed the speed limit in the eyes of the law.
I live in a 35 zone that turns to a 50 about a mile up. Quite often I'll pull off my road and follow a car going 45 in the 35 but when we get to the 50, they drop to 40. This happens enough to where I've noticed it and it's always strange to me. Someone will speed in a residential zone where it's arguably more dangerous but then grandpa it in the 50 zone..
Yup. Funny how one guy's speed matching turns into another's race.¬†


¬†I suppose after they passed someone, that they would let the same car pass them as well...because the other guy is now in more of a hurry..
Yeah dude it was fucking close. When they sped up they closed the gap with the car in front of them as well so I almost couldn't fit in but luckily I forced my way in front of the psycho and dodged the oncoming car.
I'll admit, they're super fun to drive. I'm just not quite there yet. I like being able to take longer trips without stopping. EVs are great for people who don't take long trips or have a second gas or hybrid vehicle.
Is the acceleration that much quicker? Don‚Äôt know anything about cars but tempted by EVs for all the usual reasons. I always assumed EV would be a slow poke compared to the usual gas guzzler.
This sub downvotes very quickly. Other subs downvote when a person is acting like a jerk, not expressing an opinion. I got downvoted for asking if EVs accelerate quickly. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Maybe we should just jump off and go read a book.
Lots of EVs, even the vanilla ones, are like 300 HP+ and the electric motors have God's own torque curve.  My wife's bland base model EV blows the doors off of my teutonic twin turbo.  She doesn't ask to drive mine anymore.
I don't have quite 300, but I've stripped a lot of weight. It's surprising how much quicker you'll be without seats and a spare tire!
>300 HP

Just like a V6 Camry. How special for you.
N54?
Let's get you in touch with a patent lawyer.  This is too much talent to waste.
Lolol
I mean I agree it drives me nuts.

>it‚Äôs a truck, it‚Äôs not fast,

I disagree with that. A lot of Trucks are quick in a straight line. A base model f150 is as fast as most sporty compacts to 60. I think having so much power is why people are driving them so fast.
Oh yeah that's how I recognize a brodozer. Tbh when I see a wall of light come up behind me at night I just pull off to the side. Even if I am going 15 over.
I‚Äôm not sure. Speed is often a factor in crashes but I think distracted driving is still the top issue by a lot.
That‚Äôs so few! I lived near Atlanta for a bit and watched the live tally they‚Äôd display on the highway signs exceed 1000 usually by this time of year.
Yeah, the drivers here have definitely gotten worse recently but what I described is pure Vermont.
[deleted]
If I can‚Äôt give them 4-6‚Äô, I will not pass them until I can safely. I‚Äôll stay behind them as long as it takes.
Some cop pulls you over like 10 miles away and gives you a ticket from an airplane
That‚Äôs fine, but still
No excuse to cruise the left lane while doing exactly the speed limit with other cars doing the same in any other lane‚Ä¶.i can count on getting stacked up behind one of these characters anytime I‚Äôm on an interstate and it‚Äôs almost always a NH plate.   Meanwhile VT drivers are doing 80 in the far right lane‚Ä¶
NH has the most aggressive and pervasive cops in the nation. I got pulled over at 1:00am at the bottom of a hill by a cop who said I was going 33 in a 30. Sorry that gravity exists officer!
It‚Äôs infuriating.  Like they‚Äôre self imposed cops‚Ä¶‚Äùnot on my watch, we‚Äôre all going the speed limit like god intended‚Äù
That's CT people in my experience. However NH people have some aversion to using turn signals, I hate it. Assholes in CT and MA will cut you off and weave throughout all the lanes and still signal. ü§£
I have an older BMW 5 series. I love it but it‚Äôs in the shop quite often. I was actually eyeing the newer Mazda 3‚Äôs with AWD recently. The current generation has only a slightly longer 0-60 time compared to my Beemer. Still well under 6 seconds which is all the power I‚Äôd ever need.
I typically drive 8-10 over (no tickets in over 20 years because 99% of cops give you 10 mph) unless I‚Äôm in a construction zone, neighborhood, or in busy traffic so I pass a fair amount of cars given that Vermonters are generally slower than that. I‚Äôve had countless situations where people got personally offended. One lady actually followed me to my destination after I passed her then bitched me out for the car that passed her AFTER me. She tried to claim that it was my fault for being the first to pass her. My original point stands. Go about your day and let others go about theirs.
100%

I live near VT and would rather deal with MA than VT drivers. MA will at least speed up when they cut you off or predictably challenge you at *every* merge.

A VT driver will stop for ten minutes in the middle of the lane on a blind corner with their Volvo to randomly pick up trash then get mad you when you‚Äôre sick of being blocked by them for a few minutes or road rage with you because you interrupted the beer they were drinking by getting mad at them from swerving lanes.

Cut you off and go slow. Another day pass you on a blind corner forcing a motorcycle and student driver car off the road.

Go ten under the speed limit on small back roads. Go 80mph in a 40 on the same back roads. Holy shit VT

All of these I experienced. Reckless good ol boys or entitled and dumb.

I am a CDL driver and will deal with a dick MA Beamer over a VT Volvo driver any day lol
Fair points for sure. But still, when you get passed, let it go, right?
It‚Äôs crazy isn‚Äôt it? Vermonters are generally so chill but something about being passed unleashed something so dark lol.
Yup, what you‚Äôre describing is absolutely true and I 100% don‚Äôt condone or practice that kind of driving. I‚Äôm more talking about safe passes and people taking them personally.
That‚Äôs wild but not my point. I‚Äôm not saying to normalize driving like a maniac and being unsafe. I‚Äôm just saying let it go when someone passes you.
PA does too. People are also assholes there about it.
Which is completely legal.
Also correct but they are rarely enforced as an absolute limit. Cops will give you 10 mph 99+% of the time on highways. That grace window seems to be approaching 15 mph on I-89 over the last few years but I‚Äôm not going to test it.
Who said that I only wanted to go 2 mph faster? üòè
Well aren‚Äôt you just a good little law abiding citizen. Speed limits are designed for the worst drivers with the lowest reaction time. Again, just let people do their thing. If you see them in a ditch, you can laugh on your way by. It‚Äôs still not your business to try to get others to drive the speed you want them to so my original post was directed at you.
So just pull over / slow down a little so someone can pass you. What's the issue?
Stowe is an exception. Same with Shelburne.
It‚Äôs not new really in terms of behavior on the road. The social media side is obviously newish.

Fundamentally it‚Äôs about people thinking that their time is more valuable than anyone else‚Äôs and that others need to accommodate them in the name of ‚Äúcourtesy.‚Äù

Well no. Courtesy is a favor. A boon. They don‚Äôt get it just because they want to break the speed limit and they forgot to set an alarm clock.

A lack of planning on their part does not constitute an emergency on mine.

I tend to drive a bit over the limit, but when I come up to someone driving more slowly, I certainly don‚Äôt see it as an entitlement on my part that should do anything at all.
Yes
I'm not sure what you're reading, but they said they were on a clear, straight section of road with dashed lines and a mile of visibility.
"Where did you learn to read? lol"
What's the logic here?
If Vermonters don‚Äôt want to get passed by Vermonters, then they need to drive faster.
Meaning. Don‚Äôt pass where it tells you not to, or if it‚Äôs not safe. Basically the zones, school zone, crossing zone, intersections. There‚Äôs yellow signs saying ‚Äúnot safe to pass‚Äù 

It‚Äôs definitely a farm law, but it works for slow grandma‚Äôs and oblivious drivers too.
That's so funny, I've lived in VT my entire life thinking in the back of my head I was somehow breaking the law passing tractors.  Huge blow to my ego lol
There is a specific law about farm vehicles. There is another statute that clearly allows passing on a double yellow as long as it is not within a certain distance of a curve and it is safe to do so.
New Hampshire has this as well, but specifies 200ft of forward visibility if passing on double yellow.
Genuine question- Does that count in towns and passing via the other lane‚Äôs turning lane? Saw a Subaru pass someone in Shelburne village right next to Flying Pig Bookstore and no one seemed to care. The passing laws in Vermont confuse me to no end.
They repaved VT 18 a few years back and I'm pretty sure they painted the passing lanes starting from the wrong direction.

They ground the lines off and painted new lines right after they were done.
Right, but you also have to survive the head on collision for anything to come of that
You would anyways, dashed or not if you head on and your in the wrong lane ur fucked
Years ago I was pulled over outside of Morrisville for passing on a dotted line. The old man had been doing 25 in a 35 and was barely accelerating when the speed zone jumped to 50. So I pulled out to pass him, in a passing zone. As I came abreast of him a cop came around the corner in the incoming lane. I had plenty of time but I stomped it any way. The cop had his blue lights on almost as fast as he saw me so I had to pull over almost immediately after passing the old man. The cop came up and asked why I was passing to which I told him the old man was traveling drastically under the speed limit. The cop then told me he was going to have to write me up because if it was anybody else instead of a cop it would have been a very dangerous situation.
I told him yup, I 'll be seeing you in court for this one. 

He wrote me a warning.
yeah in practice its far safer to speed up and slow down.
I'd love to see where that is in writing.
Apparently there are a lot of smooth-brains here that disagree with me. Down vote away, ya cunts.
If they're going to hold that speed and not slow down after, yeah, go ahead and pass me after but the problem is they were consistently going under the speed limit before and only decided to change their speed out of childish spite. But keep going off on your holier than thou bullshit.
Imagine risking everyone's life because you want to match stupidity levels with the guy willing to push you like that. Let that guy have his thrill boner, just stay behind him, don't match his near triple digit speeds to save yourself 3 minutes
We just bailed on the second ICE and now have two EVs. We go on frequent trips long trips, sometimes to places without much infrastructure (I‚Äôm looking at you, Adirondack Park!) and that didn‚Äôt stop us from going all in on EV. They totally rock.
I was in the same boat, realized that the pee/stretch stops every 3 or so hours made the switch to EV easy.
You could look into a plug-in hybrid. We replaced my wife's last car with a full EV and I really love it, but I also love to drive into the middle of nowhere in the winter so having two full EVs isn't really practical yet. I ended up going with a plug-in hybrid and it's basically all the advantages of the EV but also with the ability to use the gas engine when needed. Only real downside is that you need to be ok with plugging the thing in every night if you want the EV benefits.
Depends. Off the line EV‚Äôs are quick as they have basically 100% torque available immediately. EV‚Äôs top out fast though, ICE cars, specifically those with similar power outputs to the EV, generally have better top end and will do better at higher speeds and rolling starts.
Yes, it really is that much quicker.
Yes, very much so. My wife has a VW ID.4, which is basically a soccer mom compact SUV, and its 0-60 time is comparable to a Porsche 911 Carrera.
Electric motors generally have waaaay more torque than gas engines.  They also have programmable torque so you don't just spin the tires.  The downside is they tend to go through rubber a lot quicker and their top speed is by and large much lower than gas powered cars.
I want an Ionic 5 N real bad for that reason. Supercar performance for $70k? Sign me up!
300hp? Try [835hp with 900 pounds of torque](https://youtu.be/YN5rQG-0Mx4?feature=shared) for less than $100k.
This is the way
Aw, what‚Äôs wrong buddy? Show me on this doll where the BMW hurt you. I was making a joke, chill lol. We were talking about having enough power to pass safely and while my car isn‚Äôt the fastest one out there, it‚Äôs certainly no Camry either.
Yessir! In an e60 which I absolutely love. When it‚Äôs not leaking oil lol. The final of the three notoriously bad gaskets is scheduled for replacement in 2 weeks so hopefully I‚Äôll be on a good run soon.
0 to 60 they do ok, it‚Äôs past 60 where they fall on their face. No truck will do past 105 mph unless you remove the governor. And even if you do remove the restriction they‚Äôre still slow to accelerate past those speeds as weight, gearing and aero start making a big difference. Most econoboxes will accelerate quicker at higher speeds, let alone a hot hatch which will accelerate a lot quicker at higher speeds then even a tuned/bolt on mods truck will do, gas or diesel‚Ä¶ 

Trucks aren‚Äôt race cars, and they aren‚Äôt fast. Quick and fast are 2 different things‚Ä¶
I think I should do this because nighttime driving is already a little difficult for me and I'm in a pretty low car so when a truck is tailing me..oh god
would be interesting to know per capita/per road usage stats!
A very Vermont observation for sure
"don't be a complete and utter moron" is not that big a concern.

as someone who never tailgates (even if it wasn't a dickhead move, I'm not gonna tailgate because I prioritize safety too much) but frequently passes (only ever on double yellows, essentially, unless they're going 20+ under), someone pulling to the side and not pulling off far enough is extremely rare. If someone pulls over at all, it's almost always either in a passing zone (so it doesn't matter if they're not completely off the road) or into a driveway of some sort where they're not on the road at all.

Yes, it happens rarely, but it's really uncommon, and the tone of your comment makes it seem like it's happening all the time. Pull the fuck over as soon as you can. It's selfish to hold others up.
Yeah, they are shitty drivers, I agree.
Live free or die!
Ah nice. Definitely test out the new Mazda3 turbo awd. It‚Äôs pretty damn slick and will be a welcome reprieve after dealing with Bavarian maintenance worries for so long. You don‚Äôt even need to run premium (but you still can!) 

I‚Äôd be in one in a heartbeat if they put a stick in it. But I‚Äôm entering my SUV era with a new kiddo so the CX-50 turbo is in my future instead. 

Plan B is just to own a Miata as my second vehicle. Someday‚Ä¶
That would be the normal thing to do.
It's just insane. The pass ends the situation. Like you're stuck behind a guy and maybe a bit closer then they'd like so they feel anxiety and you're pissed at them and the whole situation can be remedied and put in the past by you passing. I'm ending the situation by making the pass. Why are you trying to continue it??
Sure. But not really the point, is it. You're mad at people who are upset you are making them less safe by your actions. You are breaking the law. The excuses you make are fine for what they are, but you're the one breaking the law, and it is reasonable for people to dislike that.
Either you did or you went through the trouble of posting because someone got pissed off at you for wanting to break the law in which case you have little to complain about.  Which is it?  üòè No matter your intention - Drive safe!
You posted an opinion. I posted an opposing one with an anecdotal story. Hardly a rant btw. I don't flip people off or go into fits of rage when they pass. I just pointed out that you don't happen to be the one guy the law cedes to because you think you know best. The person in my story was almost hospital bound because of an impatient driver that thought he knew best because it appeared 'safe'. Countless others have not fared better. Grow up. Everyone deserves to get home in one piece. The road isn't your playground. If you're going to get upset over an opposing point, the internet may not be for you.
But where's the power and control in that?  /s
It‚Äôs not my responsibility to pull over if I‚Äôm not impeding traffic.

It‚Äôs also not my responsibility to facilitate you breaking the speed limit laws.

However it is your responsibility to follow the speed limit and drive safely.
Also Danville lol
I think the most wild change, is for almost 50 years people drove slowly for fun just to have a joy ride.¬†

¬†Families in the 1930s - 1970s would go out for a drive and just enjoy the day and enjoy the ride.¬†

¬†Now most drivers are angry, hate driving, and in some cases use their vehicle to bully other road users.¬†

Most of these slower drivers shouldn‚Äôt be battered with hate because they‚Äôre driving the speed limit or 5 below the speed limit, they are probably just enjoying the experience.
Oh okay word they'd still have to speed tho lol
Oh yeah I pass way more slow old people and oblivious people than farmers üòÖ
Hills and curves too
The passing laws are damn near non existent. If you successfully pass them you've basically passed them as per the law. You won't know until it's too late if it was unsafe to pass. If you successfully pass them where it was obviously unsafe to pass, you made it so no harm no foul
I would say that applies to any traffic violation regardless of the color and texture of the road lines
There is no exception to the speed limit for passing. The speed limit still applies.
PHEV is honestly the way to go right now. Typically loads of power when you want it, city ranges  from 20-50 mi on electric, and they do well in the winter because of the curb weight and low center of gravity.
I use my ev/hv for 3 to 4 days before plugging in.  I also drive quite a bit of distance hauls.  I have learned that staying off interstates, save both gas and battery usage.
I feel like quick acceleration is just more valuable in general driving. I'm not going 120mph unless I'm outrunning a nuclear blast so what happens up in that range isn't to interesting.
I"m thinking either an i4 M50 or Taycan next, for that reason.  A CPO one will probably be affordable-ish.
Very nice! I've got 210k on my 335i.  They're great engines, just high maintenance.
I gotta say though, they may start stock with "only" a 12 second quarter mile, but the 10 speed 5.0 AWD f150s are absolute monsters with forced induction and are currently one of the fastest street platforms. 

Trucks aren't slow anymore, and it's pretty terrifying...
Have you ever driven a truck before? My Tacoma can easily top 115 if I wanted to, stock with no modifications.
Are you stupid?????
[deleted]
Congrats on the kid! Mine is 7 now and was very life altering including trading my beloved Honda Ridgeline (I didn‚Äôt care about the ‚Äútruck guys‚Äù stigmatizing it at all, that is a great truck) for a Pilot, which is, um, practical. 

I‚Äôm going to try to get another 50k out of the 535 because it‚Äôs just too fun and is an absolute tank in the snow but the 3 is high on the list for my next one. 

My realistic dream car is a convertible MX-5 with a manual transmission. Maybe after my kid goes off to college.
Because punishing you was what they wanted and you ended it.
Your anecdote seems to fall into the reckless and dangerous category that I said should be reported to the police. I do not drive recklessly nor do I condone that behavior. I don‚Äôt judge anyone for driving at whatever safe speed they are comfortable with. My entire point was don‚Äôt judge me for passing as it is not personal. Your tone came across as judgmental which is why I said that you are the intended audience. If I misunderstood your tone then I apologize.
So if you see someone who wants to get around you, they can legally pass you, and it's safe to do so... You just, what, would prefer that the person passes you in the other lane instead of moving over a few feet and basically taking your foot off the gas for 5-10 seconds? 

It's just being polite and effectively slows you down only for a few seconds while you also now gain a person in front of you who will be going faster than the speed limit (aka cop bait). 

Sounds to me like you're private policing the roads.
What?

How often are you getting pulled over by those... Danville Police?
Different laws.
And the difference between an EV and ICE won't make much difference in relation to outrunning the speed of sound :)
Now you‚Äôre talking!
The limiting factor for most full-size trucks isn't power, it's their driveshaft. Building a driveshaft that's light, balanced, and durable in the length required for a 12' wheelbase is expensive and often requires a multi-piece driveshaft. For this reason most of them won't survive very long beyond 100-115ish mph which is why the trucks come speed governed and fitted with S-rated or lower tires. Even the 700hp RAM TRX is limited to 118.
They run 15 second 1/4 miles stock, not 12. If you actually break down the acceleration, the 60‚Äô to first 1/8th is quick, it‚Äôs the back 1/8th where they fall on their face. Again, weight, aero, gearing start to play their part. Which is why in a 80 mph roll, a regular n/a 2.0L Toyota Corolla or 2.5L Mazda 3 will outrun any of them despite having a major power deficit. They weigh a lot less and are far more aerodynamic. It‚Äôs also why cars like the Fusion Sport 2.7TT or Taurus SHO are SO much faster than the trucks despite having the same engine‚Ä¶
And my daily driver Mazda 3 AWD will do 134 governed, and do 60-100+ rolls faster than your truck, and it‚Äôs still a slow economy car. My FBO/tuned Speed6 will do 165, before it was tuned it‚Äôd do 154 governed‚Ä¶ and it‚Äôll do 60-100+ way faster than even a tuned/deleted diesel‚Ä¶ trucks are slow compared to any hot hatch, let alone an actual sports car‚Ä¶
Ya I think the dude might be dumb  spewing off false facts like that
Enlighten how?
perhaps you aren't leaving enough space and you're making the people in front of you uncomfortable
Thanks! Same dream car haha‚Ä¶. well actually the dream dream is a 911 GT3 but barring some stroke of genius or luck I‚Äôll be happy with a current gen Miata RF manual once MY kid goes off to college. Long ways off haha. 

No shame in the Pilot - and yes my dad and several friends have Ridgelines and love them.
If they want to pass me idc.

Go nuts.

But I‚Äôm not going to pull over just because you want to speed.

And usually I‚Äôm going 5-10 over anyway.

That‚Äôs not policing, however badly you want it to be.

You want to overtake? Overtake.

Don‚Äôt involve me in your bullsh*t.
Yeah, they definitely need some upgrades but the platform is super impressive. A couple grand on a 1000hp rated driveshaft seems to not be a big deterrant. I am not a truck person but I do like horsepower and boy are those Midnight Performance Houston F150s crazy
You are right that it isn't 12, not sure where I saw that but Car and Driver says 14 at 98mph. Still pretty fast for what it is.
I‚Äôm not dumb, all modern American trucks are governed. Dodges are governed at 105, Fords are governed at 100, Chevy‚Äôs are governed at 112 (except the 6.2 which is 114). They‚Äôre all slow‚Ä¶
"Pull over" aka move a few feet to the side and take your foot off the gas. It's not saying come to a complete stop. It's called "being considerate."
For sure. I had a 2019 with just the standard 2.7 ecoboost and having not driven a truck since the early 2000s I was shocked at how quick it was off the line. Luckily the average impolite truck driver on the road is more likely to spend their money on Chinese off-road lights and cheap spacer lifts than a custom driveshaft that can hold 1000hp.
No.

Don‚Äôt involve me in your bullsh*t.
Welcome to the Internet. I was sharing my opinion and you are welcome to have yours. No reason to be a weirdo about it.
Gratitude 
I was trying to pay for my groceries this evening in Essex and the card readers were all malfunctioning and wouldn‚Äôt accept Apple Pay. Debit cards were working but I didn‚Äôt have my wallet with me. As the worker told me that there was nothing she could do, and I was preparing to unbag my groceries, a man who looked to be in his mid-20‚Äôs stepped in to pay. I was hesitant but he said he had spoken to his wife, who was smiling at me a few feet away, and he said it was no problem. I offered to Venmo it back to him but he refused. It was dinner for my family, including my daughter, and you saved me at least 45 minutes which kept our whole evening on track.

Thank you again and know that I will pay it forward by donating the dollar amount of my groceries to my local food shelf. I, like many of us, was having a terrible week but your kindness brightened my day. We have a special place here and people like you are the reason. 
There is/was a broad issue with debit transactions in the area. I am very heartened to hear this story, thank you for sharing. Vermont strong! Even if the country is seemingly in shambles.
Random acts of kindness like these help us go through these difficult times. üôÇüëç This is the standard and example we should ALL set. Not rounding people up to deport them. ‚òπÔ∏èü§¢ü§Æ
Great story. And why are grocery stores not taking cards?  Happened in our town today too
That‚Äôs so nice! One time this summer I had a quick conversation with someone next to me at the gas pump and when I went inside to pay,  the clerk told me that he had already paid for my gas! It was such an unexpected surprise, and it made my whole week honestly‚Ä¶ I wish I could find that guy to thank him
Love to read this. Be a good neighbor and pay it forward ‚ù§Ô∏è
This is why I have my wallet on me. I cannot scan my ID so I don't trust leaving my wallet at home. 

This is a sweet story. Pay it forward
I work on the front end at a grocery store in the area. Verifone did a remote POS update about 2ish months ago and we've all been having Apple Pay / Google Wallet issues ever since. At the moment it appears to SPECIFICALLY be MasterCard cards on ApplePay/Google Wallet. We've also been calling for weeks about the issue and we can't get a straight answer at all ü´†
Hanford Milton was same
Happy to hear about the kindness. I always carry my checkbook with me and think I will continue that.
Thanks for sharing your story. This is the second inspiring story I've seen on Reddit in the last 15 minutes. Just what I needed.
People. This person is expressing their gratitude for the help of a complete stranger. What the fuck does Donald trump have to do with this? Seriously? To op, you sound like a good person who was gracious for receiving help. You didn‚Äôt blame the store or the employee, and you didn‚Äôt act like you were entitled. So this is karmas way of thanking you.
***"Make America Kind Again"*** is one of my favorite t-shirts and it's time I start wearing it again.   
Stories like this make me so proud to be a Vermonter. Maybe Vermont can set an example that hate never made anything great.
I had a similar problem at Hannafords yesterday.
THIS‚Ä¶.   üò≠ü•∞
Nah. 

And if your wife divorces you,  she's still nta.
Lol. A terrible week. üòÇüòÇüòÇ get over it.
Unless it's the felon in chief who needs to go back to Russia...
Why are you making this post political?
I think by deporting illegals you‚Äôre being kind to the rest of the taxpayers
Cards were working, Apple Pay through my phone was not
It‚Äôs been paid!
I leave home without my phone all the time, never without my wallet. Fabulous to know there are still folk out there with hearts of gold.
I agree, it was a good lesson. I know my license number but you‚Äôre right about scanning it. Certain types of stores require it üòé
Ugh, thanks for the update. Almost everybody takes Apple Pay so I usually don‚Äôt care when I‚Äôve temporarily misplaced my wallet. I‚Äôll definitely be more careful moving forward.
Hannafords had a system wide issue yesterday. Affected stores all over Vermont and New Hampshire.
Good call. I keep a single check in my wallet but, well‚Ä¶
Glad it helped you too, friend!
Thank you for the kind words. Some of the commenters inferred that my bad week was due to the election and they were correct. You‚Äôre right that my main point was to share a moment that lifted my spirits and express gratitude, but I don‚Äôt mind the political discourse. If even half of the president elect‚Äôs policy ideas get enacted, it will impact all of us. It‚Äôs on a lot of our minds.
I got a text yesterday saying that Hannaford isn't able to process WIC transactions right now. I wonder if it's a related problem.
Hannaford
You will reap what you sow. What‚Äôs coming is coming for all of us.
I'd rather he stays here to stand trial, but I guess it's not going to happen now. (>.<)
> I, like many of us, was having a terrible week

You need this explained? Ok:

It‚Äôs a reasonable assumption election results were the worst thing to happen to most people in r/vermont this week. In case you missed it, 2/3 voted for a candidate that lost to an opponent that plans to dehumanize and persecute anyone that opposes them as ‚Äúthe enemy within‚Äù.
Tribalism and identify politics. Everything must be made political because they have no real identity outside of their chosen political team.
In fairness, I kind of did.
Do some research on how much money immigrants contribute to the economy. And it won't be immigrants attempting to cut medicare, medicaid and social security these next four years. That will be the GOP.
I'm all for a humane, respectful, rational and sensible immigration policy, which, yes, would include deportations. That makes absolute sense of course, every country needs (and has) one, and that's exactly what Biden proposed a few months ago, it even had bipartisan support. But Trump killed that because it didn't suit his purposes, and that's definitely and clearly not what we're looking at anymore based on what Trump and his surrogates have been saying. What they have in mind is - like almost everything else they do - clearly based on cruelty.
Totally!
It‚Äôs quite possible that the people who helped you were trumpers. It‚Äôs possible that some of the people you value and share memories with feel differently about politics than you do. I want people to understand that we all want freedom. We all do. We just disagree about how to get it.
The downvotes are üòÇ
You suffer more in imagination than in reality-Seneca 

The future is as seldom bad as your fears-Nelson Mandela.
Lol. Ok Doomer
It will be interesting to see if the Trump DOJ re-evaluates the case of mishandling classified documents by President Biden once he leaves office and is no longer shielded by the doctrine of not prosecuting current presidents.
Correct
If what you say is true, why didn‚Äôt he do that during his first term?
No friend. This is way beyond politics and what‚Äôs coming will impact all of us.
read closer, he said illegals. Illegal means you have done something against the law and there are consequences for breaking the law... or at least there should be. Also that would be the far right GOP. Moderates just need to stand up. Far right and far left politics are a no win for anyone but themselves.
Illegal immigrants do not pay any federal taxes .
ü§û
Several Democrats also voted against that bill.  It was rejected with bipartisan support, including a no vote from our independent Senator Sanders.
Sure it‚Äôs possible though highly unlikely given the makeup of Chittenden County. My problem with MAGAs is not that I don‚Äôt think they have any legitimate concerns, they absolutely do. My problem is the person they turned to to solve them. He and his surrogates have made clear that they intend to remove any and all checks and balances and that is not good for any of us. Only trump and the billionaire class will win, the rest of us will suffer. And before you say it, yes billionaires do well under democrats too. I don‚Äôt like democrats much more than conservatives do.
I'll take a look when I get back from the WalMarts
Not much grounds to revisit anything. Biden returned the docs as soon as he realized he had them. Pence was in the same boat if I recall. Both collaborated to return the docs in their possession. Trump only got in trouble because instead of openly collaborating and returning the documents, he hid them and lied about having them over and over, and obstructed justice in the process.
There's a problem in that Project 2025 reads quite Hitler-ish.
Too bad we haven‚Äôt seen any Left politics at all. Everything ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù in the US is still very conservative to the rest of the world. We‚Äôve become a far right laughing stock because nobody wanted to play hardball on the democrat team. We let a man convicted of 34 felonies win the presidency. If 34 felony convictions doesn‚Äôt come with ANY punishment, there is zero reason to think that crossing a border illegally to better your life should be anything more than a trespassing citation. If any person is denied a job from her on out, based on having a felony, the people should burn this entire country to the ground. Absolutely none of this makes sense. Breaking the law clearly isn‚Äôt even against the law anymore. Treason is no longer illegal. HAVE WE ALL LOST OUR FUCKING MINDS?!?!?
Shouldn't be any borders at all. Someone wants to come here, they can. Who the fuck cares. They need to establish residency before using any tax benefits anyway, who cares.
Great job on your research. Brilliant!
They pay in nearly $100B per year
WTF do they pay when they buy something that has a federal tax on it?
Point is: it would have passed had Trump not intervened.
You don‚Äôt think half of the population has any legitimate concerns? How about the ability to feed our families? How about not raising the tax burden so high  that it prices people out of their homes? How about not starting and funding wars that bankrupt us and cause inflation to skyrocket? How about not flooding inner cities with refugees which completely displaced the neediest population pushing them out of their cities and into ours because corporations need cheap labor, which affects those at the bottom of the wage scale even worse than those at the lofty educated top? This is why Kamala lost. Because she never made a single attempt to put forth any solutions to all the problems that she helped create? The funniest thing I keep hearing is the wealthy educated liberal class tell the working class to suck it up and get a better job or more education. Some people love what they do and do it despite the fact that they barely make it (farmers) and have a completely necessary job. Others don‚Äôt do well with education. It‚Äôs the lefts version of let them eat cake. I really can‚Äôt believe someone would actually say that. Most people don‚Äôt want to spend every waking minute working to support a family they don‚Äôt get to see as a result. Having a mortgage and kids made me go from voting for Obama twice to conservative because it was easy to be liberal when you don‚Äôt see how bad the government is at everything. Or how completely captured by corporations the media is. Or how badly our education system is while being inundated with leftist ideology.
Except it's still illegal. The crime is possessing/mishandling classified documents, and its a felony for a good reason.  Covering up that crime is another crime. Taking documents as a senator and vice president and saying "oops, sorry" when caught isn't a punishment or deterrent. 

I want/expect those at the highest level to be held to the same standard as an 22 yo E5 or other government employee who will do jail time and have their career ruined for that same violation.  

It's my hope that Trump is held to that standard when his new term is over.   For some dumb reason, we won't prosecute sitting presidents who clearly break the law. 

Giving a pass for illegal actions isn't helpful and simply sets a standard that bad actions are acceptable.
2025 was fake news written by Democrats to try to throw the election.  We all know how that turned out.
This is so true. The Overton Window is so far right.
a few million taxpaying citizens...
There are no general federal sales or use taxes in the United States.
We won't ever know.  It never made it to the floor for a full vote.
Right, but I think that DoJ usually looks for intent. And all three - Biden, Pence, and even Trump had he cooperated - could have reasonably argued (and did I guess) that they did not know and had no intent to conceal (plus I imagine they can probably argue that an assistant was handling the document and not them directly - however good of an excuse that is, it's still the reality, I doubt these guys carry their own docs).

Trump took it a step further :-D. Even had an attorney sign a letter that everything had been returned when he knew damn well it hadn't! The shit he's pulled is unreal, how he's not just walking around free but elected POTUS is something I'll go to my grave without ever understanding.

I would hope that a govt employee in the same case would be treated the same way.

Unfortunately our standards seem to have disappeared below the Earth's mantle ATM. Seems like there aren't any bad actions that aren't acceptable these days, in fact it almost seems like you're rewarded the worse you get...
Like Joe and Hunter! Who ACTUALLY did something WRONG!
Who would ever write a book that thick with attribution for fake news?
This doesn't make any sense.

It was written by the Heritage Foundation, a long-standing conservative "think"-tank.

The provenance of it is very well known.

Why do you think it was "fake news"?
It was on the Heritage Foundation website!
What?
What is the Federal tax on gasoline? Oh right. Immigrants never drive cars.
The Heritage Foundation has been publishing written policy resolutions and comprehensive recommendations for U.S. government reforms since 1981.

Center for American Progress (CAP) and Third Way are two prominent Democratic aligned think tanks that publish written goals and policy recommendations.

The same stuff happens on both sides, just one is far more publicized and weaponized.
Easy‚Ä¶Democrats!
you said who cares
That's an excise tax --- not a sales or use tax, which is what I was posting about and which are more inline with your "when they buy SOMETHING" post. 

There are also federal excise taxes on tobacco and alcohol, but if the "something" your illegal immigrants are buying isn't fuel, booze, or smokes, then they are not paying any taxes to the federal government, nor are they paying federal income, social security or medicare taxes.

That being said... you keep saying "immigrants", but you replied to a post referencing "**illegal** immigrants". These are not one in the same and it's xenophobic of you to think they are. Legal "Immigrants" built this country - and are the backbone of our current nation. There is a difference.
Yep, but they've never built a shadow government in advance before.
Yeah, why? I don't pay taxes to new Hampshire, does it mean I can't hop over for cheaper booze once in a while? It's all just lines on a map some government hoity toity came up with anyway.
Stick Season 
Decided to add another season to the collage. 
Gotta get one with snow now.
FR 71?
Not gonna lie this is a beautiful set of pics.

Now hit us with the snow pic, then sell it to silly leaf peepers who come up. 

They'd eat that shit right up.
The big grey
I love all the seasons even mud season can be fun if ya got the right vehicle. Honestly, I‚Äôm just happy to have seasons again because Colorado we had three seasons, summer, winter and fire. And every year it seem like fire season was slowly becoming a threat all year long. 
I‚Äôll take mud season over fire season any day .
Beautiful!!
Deerfield?
Almost there. Snow shot by mid Nov!
Sticks are on the ground, limbs are in the trees. Fuckin stick seasons is the dumbest non Vermont term I‚Äôve ever heard!
I can smell the top picture and now I‚Äôm sad. I‚Äôm ready for summer, can we just skip over winter?!
Good Noah Kahan song
Ugh going up to Von Trapp Resort in a week, did we already miss the foliage? Is it sticks in that area already?
Sorry, these do not depict stick season. When the trees are bare, AKA sticks, and then it is stick season.
Please post again with snow. I love this
Yup
It is easy to forget how limited a picture is in representing the beauty.
Fuck your downvotes you are 100% right
You're a month too late
Ugh was afraid of that, ok maybe can hope for snow at least. Or are we too early?
Maybe on the peaks, but we're having a heat-wave at the moment.
