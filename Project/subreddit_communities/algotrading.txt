Felt like this advert belonged in this sub 
Yup, it's taking too long
2.5 years of algos development like a fulltime job and I feeling like my current one is THE ONE.

I think there‚Äôs also a perception out there that if your model/system can beat the market that you should be a millionaire by now, but no matter how good your system you‚Äôre still restrained by your starting capital! 

Hell say your system doubled your money every year and you started with a $10,000, it would take 8 years to cross the million dollar mark!
Buy low sell high they said
so, its not just me?
How I feel after 500 successful trades in back tests in 5sec, then couple of trades a week live zzzzzz üòÇ
I have been trading my "one" trading strategy that made all the other strategies look like a high cost of opportunity. 2 years and 3 months, 62% return, -21% MaxDD. SPY for the same period 7% return, -25% MaxDD, QQQ 12% return, -34% MaxDD.   
I thought that when I had accomplished something like that I was going to be millionaire the next day, but I also thought the same with the first backtest that felt like gold, so I am used to the deception and just keep going :D
I'm gonna be a millionaire!!! (in 10 years after hours of software development)
I have extensive expeirence with models, the biggest roller coaster for me is developing a working strategy, and then it stops working within 6 months, sometimes 3months. this is because of market conditions changing, I am at a point now where I remember the market conditions for certain strategies and think to myself, "I bet my XYZ system" would work well in this current market.
Just keep reading books until you put the pieces together.
I'm just getting started.... Oh god. üòÇ
But when you get the success once it continues for life
üòÇüòÇ
Yes it does! Lmfao‚Ä¶
Just had to add that if by backtest you mean your model works on past data that assumes the past predicts the market futures but it does not!  The market performs without regard to the past.  Read a "Random Walk Down Wall Street" to disuade you from this.

Crazy idea. What if we started sharing code among us. Then we could borrow from each others‚Äô libraries and get ‚Äúthere‚Äù faster. No strategy just scaffolding.
Been there for 4 years man. Every successful backtest is often followed by a huge gaping bug. Extreme highs and extreme lows. But hey, I also think my current one is the one. Thank god for paper trading showing more reality than anything else

what strat are you using? dm?
I've read random walk and I thoroughly enjoyed it, but if you wholeheartedly believe the message and the efficient market theory why are you even subscribed to this sub?
Probably is. I believe I may have started down the wrong path to start. My first view was tracking sentiment on Reddit/twitter to find someone who was more than 50% right. I tried removing those who resulted in negative losses. Overall could not find a pattern spend about 4 months on it.
Your turn to share first
Think of this reddit sub as an industry conference. People will share ideas. But don't expect anyone to share their business secrets and formulas.
Let me introduce you to Github....
There are a number of open source trading bots already out there, not to mention hundreds of libraries to help with strategy building. I use pandas heavily.
Paper trading has me as a millionaire. Reality does not agree.
Sometimes I wonder how many of my unsuccessful backtests also had bugs, and would otherwise have been successful.
If I do make real tendies, I will post in this forum.
Get a different job or better yet make your own job, that is start a business.  Life is too short to waste on a bad job.
I guess my point is ‚Äúquick‚Äù is relative - even in the best case scenario (literal fantasy) it would still take years.
It is if you're trying to get rich quick
The variance on the probability of a single anonymous person picking the right direction would be way too high to generate any meaningful returns.
it's easy to be right more than 50% of the time, but it's hard to have favorable odds that allow you to generate any meaningful returns over a long period of time. for example, your strategy could be to sell deep otm 0dtes. sure, you'll have a high winrate, but one loss could obliterate your entire account.

Unfortunately, it doesn't work like that

What do you mean? Obviously there could be a mistake in someone‚Äôs code that makes their backtest look worse than it really is.
Backtest results for a simple "Buy the Dip" strategy
I came across this trading strategy quite a while ago, and decided to revisit it and do some backtesting, with impressive results, so I wanted to share it and see if there's anything I missed or any improvements that can be made to it.

**Concept:**

Strategy concept is quite simple: If the day's close is near the bottom of the range, the next day is more likely to be an upwards move.

**Setup steps are:**

Step 1: Calculate the current day's range (Range = High - Low)

Step 2: Calculate the "close distance", i.e. distance between the close and the low (Dist = Close - Low)

Step 3: Convert the "close distance" from step 2 into a percentage (\[Dist / Range\] \* 100)

This close distance percentage number tells you how near the close is to the bottom of the day's range.

**Analysis:**

To verify the concept, I ran a test in python on 20 years worth of S&P 500 data. I tested a range of distances between the close and the low and measured the probability of the next day being an upwards move.

This is the result. The x axis is the close distance percentage from 5 to 100%. The y axis is the win rate. The horizontal orange line is the benchmark "buy and hold strategy" and the light blue line is the strategy line.

[Close distance VS win percentage](https://preview.redd.it/394y75l3amkd1.png?width=543&format=png&auto=webp&s=c67c39068dc188da0dc0d3d3929fb58b9af234ff)

What this shows is that as the "close distance percentage" decreases, the win rate increases.

**Backtest:**  
I then took this further into an actual backtest, using the same 20 years of S&P500 data. To keep the backtest simple, I defined a threshold of 20% that the "close distance" has to be below. 

*EDITED 25/08: In addition to the signal above, the backtest checks that the day's range is greater than 10 points. This filters out the very small days where the close is near the low, but the range is so small that it doesn't constitute a proper "dip". I chose 10 as a quick filter, but going forward with this backtest, it would be more useful to calculate this value from the average range of the previous few days*

If both conditions are met, then that's a signal to go long so I buy at the close of that day and exit at the close of the next day. I also backtested a buy and hold strategy to compare against and these are the results:

[Balance over time. Cyan is buy and hold, green is buy dips strategy](https://preview.redd.it/omf6eg77bmkd1.png?width=569&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c648497275a5a54ac6e33fbcc4438e7b899c6a2)

[Benchmark vs strategy metrics.](https://preview.redd.it/lbr5paivamkd1.png?width=593&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0eb01da5b52b71f49ae483aa980477b35213517)

The results are quite positive. Not only does the strategy beat buy and hold, it also comes out with a lower drawdown, protecting the capital better. It is also only in the market 19% of the time, so the money is available the rest of the time to be used on other strategies.

**Overfitting**

There is always a risk of overfitting with this kind of backtest, so one additional step I took was to apply this same backtest across a few other indices. In total I ran this on the S&P, Dow Jones, Nasdaq composite, Russel and Nikkei. The results below show the comparison between the buy and hold (Blue) and the strategy (yellow), showing that the strategy outperformed in every test.

https://preview.redd.it/blqhj6fibmkd1.png?width=630&format=png&auto=webp&s=5aa3e5cb3e6979e32b936b4a3b4ba6e01b3e1f71

**Caveats**  
While the results look promising, there are a few things to consider.

1. Trading fees/commission/slippage not accounted for and likely to impact results
2. Entries and exits are on the close. Realistically the trades would need to be entered a few minutes before the close, which may not always be possible and may affect the results

**Final thoughts**

This definitely seems to have potential so it's a strategy that I would be keen to test on live data with a demo account for a few months. This will give a much better idea of the performance and whether there is indeed an edge.

Does anyone have experience with a strategy like this or with buying dips in general?

**More Info**

This post is long enough as it is, so for a more detailed explanation I have linked the code and a video below:

First, good post. I like seeing ideas and the results people get. Just a idea.... I wonder if adding the overnight gap to it would improve accuracy or not.
My first trading firm‚Äôs biggest strategy was a ‚Äúbuy the dip‚Äù on SPY. It was a long only strategy that outperformed during both up and down periods.

That was 8 years ago and I guarantee they‚Äôre still running it.

Buy the dip strategy intuitively just makes sense.
Interesting demonstration of the mean-reversion feature of markets.

You might be interested in this paper: [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\_id=4339128](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4339128) 

And this twitter thread: [https://x.com/RelSentTech/status/1743369914864250909](https://x.com/RelSentTech/status/1743369914864250909)

"Twice the market's return in 29% of the time?

Here's an interesting stylized fact of equity markets based on their strong mean-reversion properties (which have surfaced since the turn of the century, e.g., https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\_id=4339128‚Ä¶).  

Yesterday, the S&P 500 finished in the lower 10% of its range (commonly referred to as the 1-day stochastics). 

SPY closed at 467.31 with a low of 467.05 and a high of 470.96.  

Since its inception, when SPY has finished in the lower 10% of its 1-day range, if you bought at the close and held until there were three consecutive days in which it did NOT finish in the lower 10% of its daily range, the total return (excluding commissions, slippage) would have been 1.9x the buy-and-hold return (3567% vs. 1886%) while being in the market only 29% of the time.   

The "Sharpe ratio" (ignoring the risk-free rate) was 1.9 vs. 0.6 for the buy-and-hold, and the maximum drawdown was -21% vs. -55%.  

In the attached chart, "TIM" stands for "time in market," "SR" stands for "Sharpe ratio," and "MDD" stands for "Maximum Drawdown"  

If we only took the trade when the index was above its 200-day moving average, the total return was only 25% of the buy-and-hold return, while being in the market 19% of the time with a SR of 1.8, and a MDD of -18%.  

If we only took the trade when relative sentiment was bullish, the total return was slightly higher than the buy-and-hold return (1947% vs. 1886%), while being in the market 20% of the time, with a SR of 2.6 and a MDD of -15%."
Looks like the Internal Bar Strength strategy - good stuff. Now try replacing exit to closing near the high of the range...2-3x your results here.
Running this live, you will find executing a couple seconds before the close while using it as part of your indicator invalidates this strategy (Caveat 2). The close price is the price after the closing auction has taking place. You will have to submit your order 10-15 minutes beforehand depending on the exchange to participate in that auction. Executing couple seconds before the close will not suffice and you will find much of your performance will be gone. 

Ernie Chan has a great presentation you can find on youtube about the spurious mean reversion present in daily close prices that you cannot capture by executing just before the close.
I see a few major issues.

1. What isn't mentioned in the 'rules' above is the actual entry criteria being used in the backtest:

price\['Long'\] = np.logical\_and((price.Pct < PCT\_THRESH), (**price.Range > 10**))

I checked, and with this criteria in place (range < 10) , there are over 100 fewer trades placed.    **This extra condition wasnt mentioned above.**

The issue with using a hardcoded number like '10', is that it biases the results for when the index was smaller.  It doesn't scale as the index grows, so while at the beginning of the dataset this will filter out a bunch of trades, as the index grows it will become increasingly uncommon for the range to ever be < 10.   You need a different way to calculate this filter, or explain why it's there in the first place, how it was arrived at.

2)  The strategy purports to compare the performance of 'buy and hold' vs. 'selective buy and hold'.  That is, we want to test whether we can enhance our gains, and also reduce our risk, by finding a way to limit market exposure.  As such, it does not (to me) make sense to then calculate our gains in a compounding fashion, using something like  
price\['Sys\_Bal'\] = (STARTING\_BALANCE \* price.Sys\_Ret.**cumprod()**)

By doing this, you make an assumption that all gains are reinvested and compounded.  But this is not what we are trying to test.  We are trying to test whether or not we can beat the benchmark by selective participation.

I think the combination of these 2 is skewing the results early on, and as the index grows it starts to fail.  Not saying it has no merit, but it needs refinement and retesting / redefinition to define exactly what it entails as a trading strategy.  My independent results used a simple calculation of rebuilding what the index value would be if we did not compound and did not use a range filter.  The results are not nearly as outrageously good as they appear to be from 2000 to 2020 using the method proposed.  OP, I will share my code with you, it is quite simple.  DM me.
Good discussion.

But a code that gets financial information from the website and incorporates into signal processing is essential since people will shorting the stock overnight and the price will go down the hill.

Trying on that code now.


But good analysis.

My favorite reddit post this week.
This systems takes a huge amount of self discipline. Had an investor truly started on Jan 2000 he would had to trade this system for almost 8 years before starting to see anything on his account.
What you've proven is essentially that these indices go up more than they go down.   You can base any number of strategies off of this bias.
Caveat 2 will likely invalidate

You might compare sharpes, run sensitivity analysis on params and different time periods. IMO long tests on indices don't tell much.
What I found interesting is that if you start with this strategy after 2010, it seems to vastly underperform buy & hold
Cool results, could you implement the reverse as well, and basc short it if the close finishes near the high of the day?
I just set up and ran an equivalent analysis using Sierra Chart data.

I find that for SPX:  

With a closing Threshold of .75, this strategy outperforms the benchmark slightly  (6450 vs. 5634) since 1-JAN 2000.

With a closing Threshold of .2, this strategy underperforms the benchmark slightly  (5274 vs. 5634) since 1-JAN 2000.

This somewhat contradicts the hypothesis.  Also note, my results are not matching those posted in the original thread.  **It could be a mistake on my part, I was not able to spend as much time as OP.**
This is exactly the kind of strategy I've been wanting to implement, but my coding and math skills just haven't been up to the task. Basically just taking advantage of churn when things are mostly sideways or trending up.
Buying dips in general is good on bill market which seems to be the most of the time for the market. How about during a bear market like that 2008, 2000, and a possible black swan.
Nice write up and a neat idea. I would have also also use 20% as a threshold based on your presentation.

One thing that caught my eye is that you have calculated the CAGR as 4% for S&P from 2000-2020. I know there was a lost decade, but is this right? It seems a little low given that 2010 to 2020 was a rocket ship.
Hell yeah!

I'm curious why you chose one day dips as opposed to weekly or 3 day dips?

I would assume it would assist in the potential over fitting(I don't believe you did) and allow for larger allocation potential/less fees

On the contrary, my thoughts could be too common of an observation and therefore priced in(red weekly candle>buy)

Either way, if it ain't broke don't fix it! Great find!
It‚Äôs been in drawdown for the past 6 - 7 years even without accounting for trading costs
I don't think you incorporated dividends in your comparison.  A 2001 to 2021 hypothetical test in this article resulted in 409% for S&P.   [Put $10,000 in the S&P 500 ETF and Wait 20 Years (investopedia.com)](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/022216/put-10000-sp-500-etf-and-wait-20-years.asp).   Love the enthusiasm and effort, you learn and you grow more sophisticated and you learn what doesn't work.
For your caveat about trading on the close, you can use Market-On-Close (MOC) orders. You do have to submit the orders more than 15 minutes before close.

Edit: clarify when orders have to be placed
Nice work
I wonder how the win rate would change if you modified your entry criteria to include some voting scheme between all of the indices you tested, i.e. 2/5, 3/5 or 5/5.
Have you considered back testing this on futures or options? I know you said the drawdown was pretty low, so maybe it would transfer well.

Are you able to share the maximum number of consecutive losses?
Guess I know what bot to try first. 

My other 4 range from bad to only losing a little.
Apart from the obvious issues with actually getting the EOD price, 

The strategy outperforms the benchmark 2000 to 2010,

The benchmark beats the crap out of the strategy 2010 to 2020.
Not really a question about this post, but where can I find good information on how to do this type of testing, as someone who doesn‚Äôt program every day?
Hey! Great post. One question, what kind of platform can you use to run this with real money? I supoose you need access to a broker account API and I guess a way to run python automatically. I am new in this and looking forward to build my first strategy.

Thanks!
Do one for selling at tops
interesting!
Good infrastructure OP, did you take different thresholds rather than 20% to test maximum potential gains? We could also add a lot strategies into this frame work, i.e. hold the next day/buy more shares if larger DIP observed. Thanks for the post!
Interesting thing to see on the first chart that that no matter what "close distance" is, the win rate will be always above 50%. Also the predictor is very monotonous.
There‚Äôs so much liquidity during the last two minutes of each day, I would probably focus on that rather than acting too much sooner. There tends to be significant movement in the last minute candle, it tends not to be so much that it‚Äôs going to cause a change in window from less than 20% to greater than 20%. I haven‚Äôt tested this, but that‚Äôs my intuition.
This is great! 
I‚Äôm working on something similar with 1DTE overnight 
Trying to figure out spread strategy like firing off a bullish put spread on close 

My algo can trade off hours too so I‚Äôm thinking the option flow at close might give me a tiny boost

Nice work! Thanks for posting
When trading futures, the low of the day can happen after the ‚Äúclose‚Äù or settlement price and you need to distinguish between settlement price and last price. It actually happens often and is a pitfall of such backtests.
This is quite interesting. In testing against a simple buy and hold benchmark, have you considered a rolling forward approach? With a buy and hold approach, you are unfortunately beholden to the day you buy and if I buy and hold on a dip, I might have stronger results. What do you think?
Nice work. Strangely enough, I've found this relationship between closing distance and win rate to completely inverted in highly volatile markets. Any idea why this may be so?
Good post I like your idea, pay attention to in what points in time this performs well, eyeballing this looks like this method worked super well in 2004 to 2008 what is your benchmark outperformance say 2016 to present. 

Might be worth while slicing the results then measure it vs benchmark instead of looking at it like one thing.. this way you filter out periods where the strategy performs exceptionally well influencing the overall result.. 

Have you tried applying this on a more granular level say 1h timeframe 15 minutes timeframe.. 

Looking good keep up the work. And keep posting ! Love to see there posts more
Great backtest
i love this sub
I don't see how you are not introducing lookahead bias in your results here. 

You are filtering out poor performing days, that information can only be accessed after the day's trading is concluded.
What happens in the downward market? If markets are going up I would expect this to work because markets are going up.
So there was an approximate drawdown of 8 years? (2000 - 2008). I prefer less than 4 years.
From the win rate vs. close distance graph, I understand that x-axis is actually the threshold chosen for the strategy. I am curious what will happen if i try to short the market when the close distance is bigger than some threshold, say 80%.
Very interesting post, thank you for sharing. I will try to reproduce myself.

I understand why some of most-downvoted posts here why downvoted; they were somewhat poorly worded. However the criticism stands, I think. It does seem remarkable that the method has actually underperformed in the last few years. Could it be as @kamvia_io suggests that this method actually ‚Äúno longer works‚Äù as big-money algotrading on very short timeframes has taken over? Or another reason?

I‚Äôm just hesitant to apply this strategy ‚Äúfor real‚Äù given its relative poor performance in more recent years..
Great stuff currently working on a similar analysis for selling 0DTE credit spreads based on where SPX is at 13:00


If SPX is inside the top 20% of the range sell a Call Credit Spread around 15 deltas¬†


If it is in the lower 20% of the range sell a put credit spread same Delta.¬†


Wait for the price of the spread to go up to a specific value based on the width. If triggered do not hold to expiration.¬†
Something must be off.  I looked into this hardcore over these last 2 days.  Here are the results I have vs the buy and hold SPY. Over the last 8 months got an annual return of 14.25%

[Chart 1](https://ibb.co/V2pM527)
[Chart 2](https://ibb.co/Qbnv3rr)

I'll check 5 year here in a sec
Could you do this for IWM? Really interested in small caps and rate cuts !
I am a little confused on how out/under performance is calculated for such a strategy. Since this strategy is buying the market, wouldn't a way to estimate if it has under/out performed the market to be if (% time in market) > (% of buy and hold profits)? 

For example, If I am spending 20% of time in market but I gained 50% of the profit from buying and holding, isn't that a "outperformance" in some sense since I can reinvest the money (the 80% of the time my money is not in market) somewhere else?
Hi, thanks for sharing and starting this discussion!

I noticed you used:

* An Index, not a tradable product
* Close and not Adj Close

I tried with SPY and Adj Close and cannot replicate the results

  
EDIT:

For your list of ETFs, again i suggest:

  
**\^GSPC (S&P 500 Index)** - Equivalent ETF: **SPY**

**\^DJI (Dow Jones Industrial Average)** - Equivalent ETF: **DIA**

**\^IXIC (Nasdaq Composite Index)** - Equivalent ETF: **QQQ** 

**\^RUT (Russell 2000 Index)** - Equivalent ETF: **IWM** 

**\^N225 (Nikkei 225 Index)** - Equivalent ETF: **EWJ**
If you‚Äôre using todays close as a signal to enter for todays close, there‚Äôs already look ahead bias. The last few minutes can be volatile. 
Try lagging the signal for a day, and enter at the next open, and see how it goes (likely stale but who knows)
Will be interesting to see this on special days. I.e, if the company publishes q result after market, will you get a buy signal to buy and sell the day after the report?
For a real ticker (and not an index) like SPY, if the ETF has any dividend between start_date and end_date, would you have to account for those and add them back into your bench_balance? 

For example, if SPY had paid a cumulative amount of $2,000 in dividends during your simulation time, you‚Äôd have to add that back into your bench_balance?
Interesting. Are weekends / holidays included?
So I didn't trust the research on this. As an R guy, I knocked out the same study in under 10 minutes (go me+ ChatGPT!)  and I plotted it.  I now independently agree with the OP on their assessment of the predictive nature of the Close Distance.  I also include my code for those who also, intelligently, don't believe me either.

It will generate a nice ggplot graph with blue dots.  The grey underlying bars are a histogram to see the density.

You fitted it to a bull market of course it‚Äôs going to work. Look at the return when the market was trading in a range earlier in the data set you picked the returns were marginally better.
Buy the dip and hold?

I think it‚Äôs important to note that the index has more mean reversion nature than individual equities, so this may not hold up with I.e. AAPL or TSLA. 

I‚Äôm also noticing a lot of - perhaps all of, or even MORE than all of - the outperformance came in 2008. This strategy may well underperform outside of bear markets. Three things I can think of to look at - how does this perform through COVID shock? How does performance correlate with VIX? Would this perform better if we‚Äôre below a declining 50 day SMA? (Somewhat similar to the vix question)
Glad you're doing this with an index, you'd have to include companies that failed to backtest it for companies.
275% roin in the 20 years ? Worth ?
Test again
I think this is inherently flawed as this is only testing on the S&P500, which goes up over time. This only works on assets that are currently at or near all time highs. If you believe the asset you're purchasing will increase over the long run, then you're getting a relative discount versus buying before the dip happened.
Nice analysis! Reproduced similar results on my end in both excel and c#. Quick question: are you using the close price or adjusted close? If you are using adjusted close are you also adjusting the open, high and low? I‚Äôm currently using the actual close price but have been confusing myself on whether that‚Äôs correct or not. Thanks and nice post!
Test it again but when s&p500 gives buy signal buy TQQQ and when it's not strong enough buy signal then buy SQQQ!
You can see on the chart that its performed poorly compared to the index for the last couple years.  Every single one of these ‚Äústatistical edges‚Äù eventually reverses, generally the moment you start trading it.  It‚Äôs almost an argument for simulation theory.
explain the test to me again as if I was a moron. You go long when the close of the day is close to the low of the current day? What if the close is below the LOD
Thank you. Good point, I didn't specifically isolate the overnight gap, but when I was looking through the data to check it against the SP500 chart I noticed a lot of the profit actually came from the gaps, so that's why the backtest buys at the day's close, to take advantage of that gap.

Of course buying exactly at the close isn't realistic, so I realise there's some inaccuracy there as a result, but the idea would be to buy just before the market closes to take full advantage of the gap.
[deleted]
Sounds like the same thing as the OP strategy except it just holds for three days instead of selling at next day‚Äôs close. Thus being in the market 29% of the time versus 19% of the time.
Very interesting, thanks for linking those papers, I will have a look at them later tonight.

My backtests are a bit more rudimentary so it's useful to read up on similiar studies and tests to see what I can improve. It's good to see that other's tests have shown positive results from a simliar approach though. Of course a backtest isn't a comparison to live testing, but it gives a good starting point.
Huh, just googled that strategy and you're right, that's basically the same thing! I kept the exits simple for this first backtest to see if there's any observable edge there, so I'd definitely want to play around with the exit strategies to see if it can be improved. I'll give your suggestion a go and see what the results are. Have you traded this strategy previously?
Excuse me if this is a stupid question, but why not trade futures and buy after the stock market close?
This
Most underrated comment.

Any magic numbers in an algo will almost always take away from it's robustness.
Ah, very well spotted. Once I finished the backtest, I noticed there were some trade signals being generated by days with a small range, meaning that even though the close was near the low, the day's range was so small that it wouldn't be considered much of a dip.

So to filter this out quickly I added the **price.Range > 10** condition. This wasn't intended to be part of the backtest, otherwise I would use a value that is based on previous x days average ranges as my minimum range threshold rather than a fixed value of 10. So this was a quick and hacky check that I then forgot to remove.

For reference, without that condition, the results of the backtest are actually much better:

[https://imgur.com/a/mPVECeW](https://imgur.com/a/mPVECeW)

I'll edit the post, that's an annoying oversight but I don't think it invalidates the underlying logic of the backtest.

Regarding point 2 - I think my approach is valid. The cumprod() is multiplying the returns for each day to give you the total return over time. The benchmark return is calculated with this method as 122.01%. In my data the close price on day 1 is 1455.22 and on the last day it is 3230.78, so if you use those numbers alone then you get ((3230.78-1455.22)/1455.22) \* 100 = 122.01%, the same number.

The system return is set to 1 on days when there is no trade, so the cumprod() works the same way there, it multiplies the daily returns cumulatively, but on days when there is no trade, it multiplies the running total by 1, so nothing changes.

I would prefer to do a backtest where returns are reinvested and the balance grows/declines over time because that's how I would be trading it, so I'd want to visualise it in the same way.
Thanks, yes I think something like this would be good to automate or at least auto generate signals for so that you can get into the trade
Can you explain your comment? I don't understand.
Computers are fairly disciplined. Fail to see the problem.
No, not really. What I've proven is that when the price closes near the low of the day, it is more likely to go up than go down, when compared to the underlying index.

Ultimately the point is to outperform the market isn't it?
Casualty of algo trading?
Any single strategy will most likely underperform buy and hold in total profits, especially on an index...and that information is just as irrelevant as your comment. Nobody algo-trades a single strategy... So as long as it's profitable, it can be added to a portfolio of many. This one is in the market only 19% of the time, so there's a ton of room for others to add up and vastly outperform the market.

These pointless comments make me feel some sort of way I tell you hwat
I did a quick test of that, here's the equity chart - the system is in green:

[https://imgur.com/a/wfMl1cf](https://imgur.com/a/wfMl1cf)

It worked amazingly during the 2008 crash but has been pretty bad since then. Pretty disappointing result as it would have been great to have a strategy that works both long and short.
I linked the code just in case anyone wanted to mess around with it. It took me a while to get the hang of python and back testing but I learned from youtube tutorials and it's been worthwhile because it allows me to quickly test ideas like this. So the code is there if you want to have a look and get some practice :)
Ask Chat GPT to code it for you, no joke
Backtest is from 1/1/2000 so it includes both of those events, it actually performed surprisingly well during 2008. I guess even in a downturn there are going to be corrections and that's what this strategy captured. You get panic selling, then a correction the next day. Not always, but often enough to get profitable results - in the backtest anyway
Thanks! To be honest, no reason other than that‚Äôs the data that‚Äôs easy to get. It could also be tested on weekly but I don‚Äôt go faster than daily because I can‚Äôt easily get free and reliable data for anything faster like 1hr. 
Strategy like this would be quite suitable for daily trading though. I can check for setups once at the end of the day, and place market close orders if there‚Äôs a signal so it is a minimal effort and emotion kind of system. (Assuming it holds up in live trading)
Thanks. I've never actually tried using those, I normally just set market or limit orders as I haven't tried trading these "end of day" strategies. That's good to know that it's an option though, so within the last 15 mins of the day, a quick check to see if there is a signal developing and then place an MOC order.
Cheers!
Hmm possibly. I‚Äôve been given so many ideas and variations to test from the comments that it will keep me busy for a while üòÖ
I haven‚Äôt got that far yet, still trying to develop strategies to test but my plan when it comes to live testing will be pretty much what you said. I will look for a broker that has an API and then develop a way to automate the trades. I‚Äôve heard of it being done with a raspberry pi. There will probably be online services that allow you to do this but depends if their own fees are acceptable
Thanks!
I tested various %-ages during the initial study, which is the first part of my post that shows the chart with various % thresholds and the resulting win rate. In the actual backtest I stuck with 20% since it gave a good number of trades, but easy enough to tweak to other values.
Yep, the S&P during that period has a winrate of over 50% by itself since it has been in a general uptrend for that time, so that was my baseline, but the strategy win rate then increased even further
How about using SPY as the signal to trade SPX futures. That would solve that problem.
I hadn‚Äôt tested various take profit strategies on it yet, kept it simple for the initial backtest but one of the next steps of developing this strategy and backtest further would be to do what you mentioned and look at different ways for exiting the trades and perhaps holding onto it longer having bought at a discounted price (the dip). It‚Äôll take some time to do that though, so I generally to a simple test like this to get some initial data and decide if it‚Äôs worth continuing before I sink too much time into it
Strange, I‚Äôd have to look at the individual trades that the system generates and see if there‚Äôs something observable that could explain it. That‚Äôs part of the problem with backtesting though, unless you test in on absolutely everything, you‚Äôre going to miss out a lot of scenarios.
Thank you! Yes it does seem like it has times of very good performance and times of sluggish performance so it would be interesting to dive more into the trades and see if there‚Äôs anything specifically different about those periods. 
Daily data is easy to work with for a quick backtest so I start off with that first. It can be taken to a more granular level but requires some more work to the code.
He's buying near the close of the day so he already knows that information I guess
I reran my code on SPY over last 8 months and get similar results. Looks like it underperformed the benchmark this year although with a smaller drawdown and only 20% time in market.
The strategy probably could do with some refinement around the stop loss and take profit. 
On a separate note, what did you use to perform this backtest? The data output is brilliant! So many stats and so much information there.
Calculated about 17% for todays close distance percentage. Couple that will it being the last day and Spy historically goes up on the day before Labor Day I hope it‚Äôs gonna be a good day tomorrow.
Yea the backtest hasn‚Äôt included dividends, but I do a first pass backtest like the one I presented to get some initial results before deciding if it‚Äôs worth looking into the strategy further. Then I would model it more accurately with trading fees, dividends etc.
Yea the data is from yahoo finance. Weekends and holidays don‚Äôt have any data
This is true, and was commented on in other comments. But the counter-argument there was that this strategy is in the market for only 19% of the time, leaving a lot of cash free to invest in other strategies alongside. It was suggested this to be one strategy alongside others. Furthermore, it apparently also works in a bear market if the strategy is reversed (albeit you need to ‚Äúknow‚Äù that you‚Äôre in a bear market).
Thanks, good to see you‚Äôre getting similar results for confirmation üëç
I use the close price. A couple comments mentioned using adjusted prices but I‚Äôm not really familiar with that and I‚Äôve not seen anything to say that using unadjusted prices is wrong. But I‚Äôm no expert on this stuff, just trying to figure it out like the rest of us so maybe adjusting the prices is the right way to do it.
Please reread your last sentence. Make sure you've had your coffee.
At worst case the close would be equal to the low for that day, in which case the distance between the close and low is 0, so it still works.
Yes, I would‚Äôve suspected that. A lot of the profit would‚Äôve come from overnight gaps as well.
From what I remember it could be multi day but there were targets to exit that day.

I do remember that entries were only done in the first 30 minutes of trading
I am also curious if anyone has any real life experience with us. It seems like some of these strategies may have worked prior to dramatic increase in algorithmic trading. But have the rules changed now that machine learning is here and the trading volume has gone up dramatically?
Yeah that may be viable and worth trying out in a backtest. The point is that the close price provided by most data providers (using consolidated SIP) is the final closing auction price reported by the primary exchange where the stock trades. This information is not instantaneously available at 4pm EST. It can be reported much later.
Are you familiar with JSON response?
Computers are fine. I want to see you invest your money for 8 years before you see 1 penny of positive return.  That's the fallacy. Not computers. Humans that give up way way before.
Running a computer for a loss 8 years is a human decision.
My point was just that the directional bias of the indices makes a bunch of long-biased strategies, like yours, possible.  There's a huge array of possibilities.

I have two long-only strategies in forward testing right now.  Neither would make a dollar if the market didn't tend to go up.
Not everyone is an algo expert on here. I have 0 algo trading experience as prob 98% of the other people here. I‚Äôm just here out of curiosity. So yes my comment is worthless to you but might still be worth something to the OP. 

Nonetheless, half of your comment I found interesting. Indeed he could try to add other algo‚Äôs for the 81% that you‚Äôre not in the market. For the other half, i hope i triggered you in all the right spots
People also tend to forget about leverage. Show me a strategy that gives me buy & hold returns with less drawdown, so I can apply leverage and get higher returns until my drawdown matches b&h (or something I‚Äôm comfortable with).
Thanks, I'll check it out!
Most underrated comment on here. Really does change the game if you know some basic coding, how to avoid overfitting, and know how to prompt it properly.
Fair enough.

I bet it does hold up, but that staying true to the system is more emotional than it seems.
I edited to clarify as I see I was ambiguous. You have to place the order \*before\* the last 15 minutes. All those MOC and LOC orders get put into the closing auction.
I was more talking about win amount rather than win rate. You may have 80% wins at $1 each and 70% wins at $2. Your model may make more profit at a specific threshold that represents the peak earning of this strategy.
Makes sense, thanks for explaining!
I used lumibot.  Here is my code https://pastebin.com/VDE3Lx6W
[deleted]
üò≠üò≠ but maybe he‚Äôs talking abt aftermarket hours
ya ok. My comment was badly phrased
Cheers, and do you use any stop loss? Are you trading index futures here or ETF's
[deleted]
According to a former FED chairman the current generation of traders don't actually know how to trade a market that isn't perpetually going up. It seems exploiting this is the norm.

That said, the results for the NIkkei are promising.
Again with these people that think you only run one strategy.... That's not how it works? If your strat shows good results in any market, you add it to portfolio and see how it stacks. What if it loses for 8 years but covers losses of other starts for 2 other years?
Ah I see what you mean, that makes sense although with the way the backtest is setup here it doesn't follow the trend so much and is more of a mean reversion strategy. But you've got a good point, it may fall apart completely in a different market regime. Would need some more testing for that.
Hella triggered. Rawr!

Buyandhold comes with massive drawdown potential, so I fail to see it relevant to compare. Portfolio of algos has an advantage of being steady and preeictable, with significantly less drawdown if composed correctly. 
Regardless, everybody always says it and I am an angry tired reddit asshole so you got what you got =)
Actually, the L/MOC cut off time depends on the exchange. For instance, NASDAQ starts accepting L/MOC orders at 15:50 EST and stops accepting MOC orders at 15:55 EST and LOC orders at 15:58 EST. More info here: [https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/content/productsservices/Trading/ClosingCrossfaq.pdf](https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/content/productsservices/Trading/ClosingCrossfaq.pdf)
No stop loss but the strategy only holds for 1 day. If I was to develop it to hold for more days as others have suggested then I would want to add a stop loss to limit the downside. The test is on the underlying index which can‚Äôt be traded directly so for the sp500 I would be trading the SPY etf. I‚Äôve never traded futures though so maybe thats a possibility too.
I have never once heard the term frictional costs before so Im gonna go ahead and say no
Why not test the symmetricly opposite strategy? Should resolve the dispute. If it closes near high then you short. I would be very much interested in seeing numbers for that strategy in a follow up post. Together with simulation for some commissions.
Just reverse your strategy by shorting when the indicator is above 90%, you will see this method will lose. This method works because the index trends up
Done, and the results are indeed pretty poor. This backtest goes short at the close when the close is in the top 20% of the day's range, so it's the opposite of the strategy in my main post.

[https://imgur.com/a/wfMl1cf](https://imgur.com/a/wfMl1cf)

It did incredibly well during the 2008 crash, but has been pretty poor since then. Disappointing result although I don't think it invalidates the long only approach. The long only method is useful in an uptrend to extract a bit more money than a buy and hold by getting in at discounted points (dips).
Nice. 

I always offer this test case to people who do long only, and I never hear from them again.
So it does poorly after 2010 and also does poorly 2006-2008. I would say success strongly correlates with overall trend if not for the 2003-2006 period where market was going up but short was still successful. I'm not making any strong claims from just one plot, but it sure seems success depends on overall trend direction.

I do agree that both long only and short only strats are useful because they perform better than baseline in respective trends. So if you can figure out the global trend beforehand that can be huge.

Actually, if you combine both strats into one, will they cancel each other out? But 2008 should be profitable for both.
Sure, but that doesn't make long-only wrong.  You just need to avoid giving back much when the indices are moving down.  Lots of ways to do that.
Symmetricaly opposite strats don't work. Market moves down differently than it moves up so make opposite strategy of even something that is an awful loser does not at all guarantee success. I've done many and they never play out the way you think they would.
They should, and they do, if you structure the trades correctly. 

Long/short is a thing, and all good academic/scientific research is evaluating a theme from both sides of the market.
What have been your breakthrough/aha moments in algotrading?
I'll go first.

First and foremost, I am certainly not an expert or professional, but I have learned a thing or two in my couple years of learning. The number one thing so far that has transformed my strategy development is creating my own **market and volatility regime filters**. I won't get into specifics, but in essence these filters segment the market into different "regimes", such as extreme bull, neutral, bear, high vol, medium vol, low vol, etc. 

**Example**:

Here I've imported a simple intraday breakout strategy onto the ES that I originally developed on gold futures

[As you can see, not the greatest system but it is profitable.](https://preview.redd.it/3yhtrov7brcd1.png?width=1608&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f766551009350413b0f46d015f0b438618a5f4c)

**Note: I did not change any settings so this is far from being the most "optimized" version.**

Now, using my volatilty filter, I can see what it looks like only trading in certain regimes.

**Example**:

Trading only in **high volatility** conditions

[From this, we can see that this system generally doesn't do well in high volatility conditions](https://preview.redd.it/dau0k109crcd1.png?width=1611&format=png&auto=webp&s=050428057fdf27dda31cb6b497ae526f4b027df5)

Trading only in **medium volatility** conditions

[Much better, but certainly not the greatest on its own](https://preview.redd.it/e59dw14icrcd1.png?width=1604&format=png&auto=webp&s=19efdef346ef66ad2d9c6f59e48eecb4e36b5198)

Trading only in **low volatility** conditions

[Again, much better but not something I would trade on its own](https://preview.redd.it/84ov2bq1drcd1.png?width=1605&format=png&auto=webp&s=b29a0c30e081e0903cf0db1cab62fe1e2010b182)

From this quick analysis, we can see that the system doesn't perform well in high volatility, so lets just not trade in those conditions. Doing so would look something like this.

[By simply removing the ability for the system to trade in high volatility conditions, we've improved the net profit and the drawdown, making a better looking equity curve.](https://preview.redd.it/zypb0z3kdrcd1.png?width=1611&format=png&auto=webp&s=35af40bf729325928410610e5d80a5ee3d6ba47a)

Now, diving into different **market regimes**, we can see that the strategy doesn't perform all that well in extreme bear or bull conditions.

[Trading only in extreme bear conditions + not trading in high volatility](https://preview.redd.it/xord6azefrcd1.png?width=1599&format=png&auto=webp&s=4fd01acf20778470823951276683ca3935581866)

[Trading only in extreme bull conditions + not trading in high volatility](https://preview.redd.it/ragfy5plfrcd1.png?width=1598&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8619ea766624359e332141e04d2ecb5e8c8979c)

**Note: Without adding in the volatility filter, the strategy does worse in these conditions, so it is not doing poorly just because it's not getting to trade in volatile conditions.**

So, by filtering out extreme bear market regimes, extreme bull market regimes, and high volatility regimes, we are left with an equity curve that looks like this.

[A much better looking equity curve that produces much more profit and significantly reduces the drawdown.](https://preview.redd.it/pt6eludagrcd1.png?width=1598&format=png&auto=webp&s=eaff473d98b208e2c469675e48d464a9e26353fc)

**Final Thoughts**

Keep in mind that I have not altered any values on anything here. The variables for the entry and exit are the exact same as what I had for my gold strategy (tweaking the values I can get slightly better results so this is certainly not overoptimized, and there is a large stable range for these values that produce similar profits and drawdowns). The variables for the regime filters have not changed, and I don't ever tweak them when using them on different markets or timeframes. 

This was a more high level approach to filters. What I normally do is create a matrix in excel for each different permutation (ex. bull & low vol, bull & high vol, etc.) to further weed out unfavourable market conditions. Getting into the nitty gritty would hace created a very long post, hence why I went with a more high level approach as I believe it still gets the point across.

For those newer to algotrading, I hope this helps! And for those with more experience, what else have you found to be instrumental in your strategy development? Any breakthrough or "aha" discoveries?
Fantastic post, would upvote thrice if I could.

As someone with a stats background, something of an "aha" moment was realizing my brain is a pretty damn smart pattern-recognizing machine that I should rely on more heavily when designing either rules for rule-based strategies, or features for ML strategies. 

Basically I originally tended to look at various metrics (returns, Sharpe, R-squared, drawdown, trading frequency etc etc) to tell me what was going on. Instead, I started plotting everything visually and realized there was a ton of complexity that was being completely missed by the simple original metrics. 

Make graphs of everything and really study what's going on. I started implementing a practice where I would say "no coding allowed for several days" and during that time, I would \*only\* make visuals of the data (classic data inspection kind of stuff) and make notes/observations.

Plotting not just strategy performance, but relationship of strategy to the underlying market, regime-based stuff like what OP suggested, volatility etc. just to try to understand my market from as many different angles as possible. Became a lot more easy to design strategies and test hypotheses.
I'm in the small caps market and my goal is to catch intraday momentum both long and short. I have done well in the past trading manually with simple data and my current semi-automated system is all about automated risk management in position sizing during entry and setting up automated stop loss orders. I pick the direction and entry level of the trade though. It has eliminated my erratic bad days. The automated risk management is based on intraday volatility of that stock on that day.  
The idea to focus only on risk management came by looking through the data of successful months in the past where I don't really win more than 50% of trades. I saw the kind of analysis that people were doing, and then tried a bunch of my own and decided it is a fool's errand to predict the direction of a stock on a given day. So, decided to stick to that which I can control and let go of those which I cannot control.
Great post! My ‚Äùaha‚Äù moment was probably when I discovered how correlation worked in a portfolio environment, that even a negative yielding strategy could improve the performance of a portfolio. From there I started to focus on building and optimize my portfolio with simple strategies rather than a single optimized strategy. The real trading journey started after that moment.
Questions:

* Do you use Pinescript as your main dev env?
* By filters do you mean controlling if the strategy takes trade based on additional market information example VIX ?
Love that moment when people goes from ¬´I‚Äôm gonna be a billiooooooonere¬ª too ¬´‚Ä¶..oh shit¬ª and they realize it‚Äôs a lot of hard work and failures until one starts turning a profit based on learnings
Interesting!

One of my ‚Äúaha‚Äù moments was managing to add exits in my vectorised backtest framework.
Great post! I agree completely with the separation of 'market conditions' or regimes. Many algos seem profitable over a section of the market, when you look deeper it is often in specific market conditions before it changes to another condition where it loses money. Filtering out those conditions using indicators helped my algo trading immensely.
9 years experience my biggest piece of advice to anyone who wants to be serious. Less is more always.
How do you identify bear/bull high/low vol without looking ahead?
AHA #1 --> fees are killer. absolutely need to account for this + slippage.

AHA #2 --> my best strategy is ridiculously simple and intuitive.
Was the volatility regime filter trained out of sample? I suspect the answer is ‚Äúyes‚Äù based on your comment about keeping the regime filter variables fixed, but just wanted to check. Great post, thank you!
This is really helpful, I really want to create such filters to find the right market climate for my current strategies. 

It is great to know this filtering has been done, good job! any recommendations on how to go about volatility calculations for intraday strategies? 

I‚Äôve tried basic directional indicators like ADX etc. Im fairly new to algo development for context but I am a programmer so have picked up some concepts at a decent pace
1. For some reason, I had been thinking that the entry signal had to be generated by the same logic as the exit signal. What I have changed is that I have two fully independent algorithms for entry and exit. 

2. Additionally, as my live strategy is trying to catch big moves, I skipped take profit at all. Exiting position is fully managed by a custom-made trailing stop logic.

3. I start the position at, say, M30 view, but while managing the position the algorithm can also utilize H12 data frame. So, not sticking to one data frame. My algorithm performs well on starting with M15, but also with starting at H4.
This could eventually work if the performance remain similar in out-of-sample data, I don't want to ruin the party, but this seems a lot curve fitting to me.
What aspects of the market / underlying did you look at in order to create the filters? 

Not asking for the exact formulas/info but wondering if looking at things like (all daily/weekly) relative VIX/Dollar index returns, option-implied volatility, distance from EMA/SMA are in the ballpark or if it took more advanced tinkering.

Edit: Asking because this could be aha momentü§£.  I have my own ML filter I‚Äôve been working on but instead of market regime filtering it filters for the top x% percentile of risky days/trades (last 30-100 days by drawdown or avg loss using formulas based on previous days OHLC). Something over top could be the extra sauce I‚Äôm looking for
One of the ‚Äúaha‚Äù moments for me was the realization that a strategy should be profitable on at least 50% of similar assets without any parameter adjustments. If the strategy is for crypto, I apply it to 100+ coins to confirm that it‚Äôs still profitable and not overfitted
linreg is good actually.
My aha moments have more to do with data and programming.

Make it work, make it right, make it fast.

If it makes sense for your strategy/time horizon, use adjusted prices. What I've captured in dividends has offset all of my TC to date.

Abstraction can be applied to your trading. Abstract your risk management so that it is monitor-able and observable. Abstract your execution so you can constantly improve getting better prices. Abstract your signals so that you can thoroughly research the model, and compare them against other models so that your coverage is diverse.

Also, if you feel comfortable in pinescript, python is not hard to switch to. Started in pinescript last year because TV made it super easy to prototype. Occasionally I'll jump into TV to visualize an idea really quickly to see if it's worth my time to build out in my stack.
nice, I have question:

- How far do you backtest your strategy?

- Is there any case your result not consistent in some period? For example, you see your strategy has consistent profit with low volatility in 2020-2021 but failed in 2015-2016.
Fantastic explainer and real screenshots.  Thanks for taking the time to create and share this. This could be a highly rated Medium post too.
Finally a good post.
Has anyone tried using Hidden Markov models to establish market regimes? Has it been successful? I want to try that way but I don't know if it might be too complex or even useful to use to establish when to trade with some systems.
Thank you very much for this post. I am only a very beginner to this topic (started to read up on this topic just weeks ago), so would you mind to share
1. Which source do you use to get historic data?
2. Which tool did you use to generate these charts? Is it a backtesting tool?
3. Which tool do you run your algorithms on?
4. Which broker do you use to plug in your trading bot?

I will most likely be able to figure it out from there, but it is quite overwhelming to know which sources to start from as there is so much out there.
My biggest ‚Äûaha‚Äú moment was when I realized that no manual/discretionary strategy works sustainable for several years. 

I traded retail, SMC, liquidity inducement, range etc. but nothing worked for more than some months. 

I digged into algotrading, learned mql5 and saw the beauty of data and its possibilities.
This singular post lead me to my own AHA moment. Great post! Cheers

When my features (ML algo) gave me high enough r2 I thought I had "aha" moment. Later on, I realized I still need a strategy to use Ml signals as my signals can only explain a certain percentage of market movement. That's my aha moment
in essence what you found is that: in high vol times you have a low sharpe ratio and in low vol times a higher sharpe. this is basically by definition.

on the "exteeme bull/bear market" performance : you have found that your algo works badly in the tails, so usually it's a bad sign. also this is very overfitting already (less time to react than with spikes in vol) and how much "overfitted" depends on whether this filter is forward or backward looking. if its backward looking it's not that bad but still you are by definition going to be the last one to trade out.

if i am to guess this is some form of trend following because it doesnt work well when direction  changes often (high vol) or when it abruptly changes (big absolute change) but worls "in the middle" which is fine as long as you understand it.

so good work but I dont see anything profound here.

as for my "aha" moment: when I started to  "see through" and analyse results like this one.
I'm a total noob. What is this application you are screenshotting and how do I get it?
Great post @OP. What time frame do you anchor your strategy/trading in?
This is a superb post and much appreciated üôè

I note the use of TV which I use for analysis but have found backtesting really confusing. Consequently have been building out algo strats using cTrader which has superb backtesting and optimisations. 

Some questions:

- Am I missing a trick with TV or is it just not great when it comes to automation?

- any strong opinions on cTrader?
I‚Äôm a work in progress trying to find an algo strat I‚Äôd trust with real funds, but my base journey to date:

- as with trading I‚Äôm finding focussing on the process helps a lot with the algo breakdown

- as another person pointed out - working to optimise each area as an ongoing ‚Äúproject‚Äù: entries, exits. 

The top level market movement as a determinant of which algo to deploy as discussed by OP is a must.
Great post! Im currently in the making of a filter similar to this. There is one question I have for you since it is something I'm wondering myself.

The regimes you identify. Are they treated like areas on the chart with vertical start and end points? Thus if a entry signal occurring inside of this area the entry condition might be denied due to it occurring inside the filter area

Or are the filters instead just formulas applied directly to the entry conditions itself? Hopefully you understand what I mean. In any case, thanks.
‚ÄúAha‚Äù was understanding why I should be paid to trade
Great post !!!
Is this prospective or all retrospective back testing, which is flawed.¬†
For what it‚Äôs worth, do not rely on Trading View back-tester for strategies involving lower time frames. I am talking about 5m and below. With a good strategy, you will see phenomenal returns on TV that are more modest in reality.

That said, your time will almost always be better spent on improving your risk management than anywhere else.
Hey! What software or how do you conduct these analysis? I do have a good idea on how to build a relatively robust algo but have no capabilities in executing the testings
my own¬†**market and volatility regime filters**

  
Can you go into specifics? would love to integrate this into my script to see how it performs.
My mini aha moment was filtering trades for specific conditions before entering (that are unrelated to my main trading strategy). Before this every time the alert came I would enter trades and by reducing the number of trades taken a day my profits improved and variance reduced.
When I first started out, I tried hunting for patterns and optimal parameters, such as optimizing MACD params and even counting the number of increasing/decreasing bars etc. I realized that I should just leave the params as-is and just look at other TA factors to confirm the movement/trend. The ability to change params and code up custom indicators is sometimes more of a curse than a blessing
For me. At one moment, 6 month after starting to code my own backtester, It happend that backtester and coding started to teach me some thing that i would never figure at my own.
So i encourage all people to code their own backtestet
Now iam the number 30-35 in collective2, and gaining a good money in my own account.
good post, had the same insights. also charting algos are infinitely more profitable than algos that dont use geometry, meaning trend lines
My breakthrough moment is defined as KISS, Keep It Simple, Stupid
Holy shit weird timing, just got my regime strategy up and running still working out the kinks. Not familiar with pinescript Is this based off of Gaussian HMM?
Variable parameters changed everything for me. And I don't just mean variable position sizes and TPs/SLs.

Let's for example use an RSI (I don't use this but easy example because everyone knows it)

Let's say you have:
Length
Overbought level 
Oversold level

Have the market decide what these parameters are. Nothing static. Completely changed the game for me. The two trickiest parts are
- so how are you going to let the market decide these?
- make sure backtester correctly uses this, otherwise there's no way to know if its any good.
This may sound basic but sticking to the rules of my systems was my aha moment. I kept over riding my system, making excuses to take a quick profit, or not take this trade because i feared something etc etc.
Congratulations for this work, very informative post!
I also build my strategies on Pinescript/TV and trade with IBKR.

That I‚Äôm really bad at this
great post
Education background, I double that intuitively understanding the what you're looking at is super important.

A lot of people are taught math by memorization, but that's really only the first step of learning anything. It's not until you have an intuitive understanding of the content, that it really starts to click and you really start to use that understanding in novel ways!
I also have a background in stats, and have been interested in going a similar route. Where could I find data to analyze/graph? Noob question, and I have done some research but thought I would ask someone- I am thinking of using TOS is this a good platform?
Simpson's paradox says Hi!

Well, with your background and with this experience you have gone through, I think you'll find a book pretty interesting to read - The Book of Why by Judea Pearl. 

Domain knowledge + human intuition + statistics makes a much better combo than statistics in silo.

Kudos on your journey. And yes, human beings are still the best pattern recognition machines as far as visual representation is concerned.
Yes, this! That is exactly what I had done as well. It helps in gamifying the objective.
I, along with everyone in this discussion, do not consider predicting price direction to be a foolish task.

However, I strongly believe in your approach, especially when applied after finding a reasonably successful predictive model. You trade the model using your risk management approach.

Could you please explain your risk management approach so that we can implement it?
1. Yes. I know it isn't the greatest as it lacks some features (like combining different strategies into a portfolio), but it allows me to execute these strategies live, something other common platforms can't do since I'm in Canada. I also do some additional analysis in excel by downloading the backtesting data.

2. Yes that is the basic jist of a filter. I generally follow a "formula" so to speak of basic entry and exit + filter. VIX levels could be an example of a way to filter volatility but is not what I personally use.
I'm a month into not making a lot of money!

...I mean yesterday I made ¬£4.88 by mistake, didn't even realise a cBot was active and it closed up and couldn't re-open due to a lack of margin, but I have technically made some Algo money, so it can only improve from here. :-)
Dude, THIS! Any luck yourself? Been trying for close to 1.5 yr now. No breakthrough, but steady learning and skills so far.
I was playing with an idea of precomputing an extra column to my back testing data, which would say "that would be the P/L if you take the trade at next Open". Is this what you mean? What benefits does that approach provide (other than perf)? Do you run some heavy optimizations where it helps?
Ideally, you'd need tick data to properly backtest Stops (take profits and stop losses) or is there another way? Been trying to figure that out in python
Would filtering based on VIX or even a SMA10>SMA50>SMA200 work or we need something more solid?
You have profitable strategies that are *really* simple?
Because of GARCH, you can actuall look ahead for vola. High vola tends to be followed by high vola.
Returns for #2?
I developed both regimes outside of any strategy to prevent over fitting for one specific strategy. The way I determined the variable values was a mixture of intuition and an eye test - seeing if the variables led to results that I would agree with by just looking at the chart.
I'd recommend focusing on ATR and building off of that. By itself, it has limitations as each market and each time frame have vastly ranges so you'll need to figure out a way to normalize it.
There are some prominent algo trading authors/instructors who suggest initially testing a signal symmetrically. As I started by trading stocks & indices, I \*never\* had the inclination that this was a good idea, because stocks tend to take the escalator up and the elevator down.

Turns out this is often true in commodities, and in some forex pairs, e.g., JPY pairs for the past few years.

I also never believed in fixed TP. It can work passably in a scalping algo, but given the random/chaotic nature of the market, more often than not, with a fixed TP, you're either leaving money on the table or worse, falling just short of your target when it reverses on you.

There are a lot of different exit techniques I consider. I've generally found certain ones to work better for mean reversion, others to work better for trend. My favorites, though, are when I'm doing a ranked rotation strategy, and can exit when one asset just becomes "less strong" than another.
This wasn't meant to be a comprehensive post about how to backtest nor is this a finished and complete strategy. You are correct that you run the risk of curve fitting, but simply dividing your data into in and out of sample data and doing this sort of analysis you can reduce that risk.
The filters I made are really not all that complicated. My market regime filter involves linear regression to help determine if it's bull/bear/chop. My volatility regime is a little more complicated, but is based on ATR as it works for any market, while something like VIX is only really relevant for trading things like ES or NQ.
[deleted]
Then from those 100 coins would you pick the most profitable ones? How would you evaluate which ones to trade without a hindsight bias?¬†
What inputs do you usually use? A generic answer would be totally fine.
I have tried python in the past but always found pinescript to be so much faster to as you said verify an idea. It also has a bonus of being able to connect to my broker through webhooks so I can trade strategies live. That said, I am fully aware of the limitations of pinescript haha. What backtesting library do you use in python?
I like to backtest at least 10 years. There will likely always be periods where a strategy stagnates or even performs poorly - there is no one holy grail trading strategy. The way you mitigate drawdowns is by running a portfolio of different algorithms that have low or maybe even negative correlations.
what's the point of a highly rated medium post? job resume? (curious)
I've tried it, didn't find too much success. Was simpler to just use rule-based regime "detection" imo
Dm me
I‚Äôm learning smc right now, do you think algotrading would be more worth my time?
Maybe you need a few more AHAs, since NQ made 1100% in these 18 years.
That‚Äôs trading view, and he‚Äôs looking at the back tester to test strategies that are made in pine script
I tend not to go below 4H bars as it decreases how far back I can backtest.
TV doesn't have any optimization features so everything has to be done manually. I use it because I'm familiar with it and can test out an idea very quickly. It also allows for fully automated trading through my broker. I've never heard of cTrader before.
Not sure I understand what ur getting at here. You can imagine that the regimes are like areas on the chart with vertical lines, in fact I do add that to the code to double check that the logic is working. As for the actual logic, it looks something like this:

LongCond = entry trigger + filter (ex. not in high vol regime)
The are several ways to measure market regime whether it be MAs, lin reg, etc. And within each option you can do different things like crossovers or slope to determine if you are in a bull/bear/neutral market. For volatility, I've found that range bound ATR based oscillators make for easy ways of dividing markets into low/med/high vol as it's normalised and thus transferable to other markets and time frames.
I developed my own backtesting tool because I couldn't find the specific features I needed in off-the-shelf platforms. However, I'm struggling to see how it helps with my algorithm development. Could you elaborate on its potential benefits and provide some examples?
Yes a combination of intuition, to lead you to the right questions and algo can return a viable edge in the market.
Sure, it works fine. The screener in ToS allows for export of data in various formats too which you might find useful
As for me, the data to analyze is the results of my own backtests.

The platform depends on what exactly you want to do.
Simpson's paradox is one that always blew my mind :) Thanks for the recommendation!
Have you ever tried ninja trader.. I find pinescript and trading view environment was so finicky to backtest (but so nice for visualisation when actively trading) and it seemed to have no end game since you can't execute your strategy live. 

Ninjatrader despite some flaws is a breath of fresh air for back testing.
Not sure if we are talking about the same thing.

What I mean is the calculation of entry and exit signals. This is quite simple to accomplish through vector if the exit is pre-defined at time of entry. Example: entry when fast MA crosses upwards the slower MA; exit when fast MA crosses downwards the slower MA. 

But what if you enter the trade and stop is triggered before the fast MA crosses downwards the slower MA? You would need to iterate your vector calculation, as you may generate another entry after your stop (which you wouldn‚Äôt have found without the iteration).

This could be easily accomplished using for loops, of course. That‚Äôs where performance plays a big role, exactly as you said.

It‚Äôs a bit complicated to explain but let me know if still unclear.
You are correct. The method above has its pitfalls if compared with tick data backtesting.
I tend to use Moving Average change (slope) for direction and also tight bollinger bands to see if it is inside or outside.
Yes. Relatively simple compared to some strategies in my earlier years or some I see on these forums. People tend to always prefer a complicated system as they think they are inherently better. I‚Äôve often found the opposite to be true.
My best is about 80 lines. 5000%+ CR backtested to 1/1/2015 w a handful of unlevered assets
Probably a total n00b question... but doesn't "looking ahead" mean taking data from the future that doesn't exist yet?
36.18% over the past 4 months since I went live. Mind you, the market has been gangbusters during the past 3 months. I definitely don't expect these types of returns long term.
What additional steps would you consider before you consider this a finished and complete strategy? A complete beginner here, thank you for the brilliant post!
Absolutely, yes. Thank you for the post!
I think people who are interested can build on something fairly simple like computing the average ATR over x period, and if current ATR is higher than the average by some %, it's a high volatility regime (and lower by some % would be low volatility)
Is your market regime a longer long time frame than your strat? The same?
Ahhh ok thank you for that. Definitely good info that I‚Äôm going to look into for my own strategies
#TIL
I just trade most of them :) you never know which one would perform better or worse than in the test
Pinescript is faster because all of the tools are built for you. But there's a trap, in that, development in python is only slower because you don't enough yet. Goes back to that, make it work, make it right, make it fast. Also started with TV webhooks -> server-> broker this time last year, a year later, I'm all in-house.

I wrote my own backtesting tools. Vectorized operations with pandas mostly. The reason I built my own over existing libraries is because the strats I was testing weren't plug and play (and doing it myself wasn't very difficult). Time Series momentum, Stat Arb, Derivatives, Portfolio optimizations... existing libraries didn't fit my use case lol.
one problem I've found with pinescript is that you can only trade one symbol at a time. You can't build a strategy that picks and chooses among multiple symbols or interprets the price action of an underlying and then buys the corresponding option.
thanks for answers, can I know what algorithm you use to determine different "regimes"?
Wider audience. Share the wealth. 
And like you suggest, if you go job hunting it‚Äôs nice to have passion projects like this documented.  It shows both your analytical and communication skills. As someone who hires Data Scientists and AI researchers it‚Äôs huge bonus points if your resume points to a GitHub and/or blog. Helps you stand out.
Oh lordüòÖ stop this bs please asapüôèüèº

I made the whole learn circle as well:
1. Retail Trading
2. SMC
3. Liquidity Inducements
4. Range Trading

Nothing worked for more than 2 years. Why are reatil funds or hedge funds not trading just price action? Because it doesn‚Äòt worküíÄ

If you really really wanna trade price action you MUST trade orderflow with futures on footprint charts. That‚Äòs the only way to go with price action tradingüíØ

Algo trading is on a different level:
1. Algos execute without emotions
2. Building an algo portfolio is key! You can trade several assets in several timeframes and diversify your portfolio.
3. Proper Risk Management: With ML you can improve your risk management and your algos are becoming ‚Äûintelligent‚Äú. They open the proper lot size according to the setup they wanna trade.
4. An algo can process thousands of data every second. Can you too? No, obviously not. And with data I mean using tick charts, volume, volatility, orderbook, etc.

There is no reason why someone shouldn‚Äòt get into algo tradingüòäStart and learn with python. If you can‚Äòt code then check codecademy.com to learn python and using ML/AI. 

DON‚ÄòT start with PineScript or MQL5 because they are very limited. In addition, you write the code only for Tradingview and Metatrader5. With your python code you can just connect to the APIs and use the same code for different softwares.

Cheers buddyü§ùüèº
The point of it wasn't the amount of profits it made. Also, I believe this was USDCAD, not NQ
I‚Äôm still working through cTrader but it seems pretty good (have a friend who has worked with it extensively). You can run optimisations on strats to see the best backfit, speeds things up but can also encourage you to overfit. 

I‚Äôve also been playing with a plugin called algobuilderx (I have no connection or affiliation whatsoever) which lets you programmatically design strats with drag and drop and have to say it seems pretty excellent‚Ä¶ I now feel like I have all the tools I could want, any lack of results is down with me :))
There is a workaround through alerts and webhooks that I use from TV to execute live strategies. I don't trade any high freq strategies and all my signals get executed and filled within 10 seconds so it works for what I'm doing rn, but yes definitely missing some features like portfolio building or optimization. As for Ninjatrader, as far as I'm aware it's not available in Canada.
It's because of overfitting, right?
please share!
Great. Any advice for how one would go about finding simple yet effective strategies?
yeah, as u/swinghodler said. Make an ATR oscillator. In fact, TV has a bunch of these. Set your thresholds to > 80 and < 20, etc. Something like that.
Hey, I am currently also built my own trading robot in python and mainly trading in cryptos. Previously I  am still using the vectorized backtester to optimize the weight for multiple strategies and instruments, but I realized there is an "aha" problem in the backtester.  The daily return we got assuming we only buy and hold for each time. if we want to top up or reduce the position, we can only use event based back tester. Recently, when I back test again the very simple trend following strategies on crypto intra day data, it is so real to see the SR is only 0.002-0.001. I am still thinking going deeper into statistic arb or the ML way to general signal/filter signal. I do appreciate if someone can give some tips on above
That‚Äôs awesome I really appreciate the response! Yea the smc stuff only seems to work some time, and if it doesn‚Äôt there‚Äôs always some random reason as to why it didn‚Äôt. Any good setups I should be playing around with? Just made the move to full time trading after a great consistent few years and ofcourse everything started going sideways so I gotta figure something out lol
which broker are you using in Canada?
Well I live in Canada and use ninja so they must have released it for Canada at some point. Even had a guy from NT call me to ask how I was enjoying it.
There‚Äôs many reasons, In all design not just markets a robust system will always thrive over a complex one. Now of course this is within reason the system still needs to hold an edge. But the more complex the more room for error in testing, the more likely something will fail & generally speaking the less robust the system will be. Read about Ockhams Razor theory the belief is the more steps it takes to get to your goal the more likely things will go wrong. Simplicity & robustness are key elements in successful trading systems & in my experience are almost ALWAYS overlooked.
Read lots and do a bunch of backtesting. Try using leverage and see how it relates to market conditions, like volatility, just as the OP noted. Verify with multiple sources to make sure your strategy holds up.
Create a column to track when you're in a position, calculate equity on those rows. Figure out however you want to balance for cash then cumsum for the result. You can get your drawdown stats using a similar method!
from what i know algo trading to retail trader is not possible with canadian brokers. I want to do it.
IBKR
Are you able to trade live through Ninja trader in Canada tho? I seem to recall that I wasn't able to at the time I was looking into it but maybe that's changed.

btw, to keep it pythonic, complexity is OK. complicated is not.

Oh, r/algotrading, the sacred temple where everyone is an undiscovered Wall Street genius with a budget of $200 and a dream. It‚Äôs like the Silicon Valley of financial fantasies‚Äîeveryone‚Äôs convinced their Python script will outsmart Goldman Sachs. The place where the phrase ‚Äûbacktest‚Äú gets thrown around more than common sense, and everyone‚Äôs a self-proclaimed expert until they‚Äôre not.

It‚Äôs hilarious how every other post is about someone‚Äôs ‚Äûrevolutionary‚Äú trading bot that can predict market moves with stunning accuracy‚Äîuntil it doesn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs the land of Reddit where people think they can turn $1,000 into $1,000,000 by running some code they found on GitHub, all while ignoring the minor detail that if it were that easy, everyone would be doing it.

And let‚Äôs not forget the endless debates about which programming language is superior for trading algorithms. Python vs. R, with Matlab thrown in for the old-school crowd. As if the language is going to make any difference when most of these bots are getting crushed by transaction fees and market slippage.

Then there are the ‚Äûgurus‚Äú who show up with their 14-step programs to financial freedom, conveniently only asking for a small upfront fee‚Äîor better yet, access to your account. Because who wouldn‚Äôt trust a total stranger on Reddit with their life savings?

In summary, r/algotrading is like a digital wild west of wannabe traders, each one thinking they‚Äôre the next big thing while mostly just contributing to the noise. But hey, at least it‚Äôs entertaining!

3. Regime-Switching Models: Use machine learning to detect market regime shifts and adapt strategies accordingly.

4. Deep Learning for Feature Extraction: Apply neural networks to extract subtle patterns in volatility and momentum.

5. Adaptive Portfolio Optimization: Use dynamic risk-parity or Kelly Criterion for smarter portfolio management.

6. Agent-Based Modeling: Simulate market participants‚Äô behavior for emergent trading opportunities.

7. Asymmetric Information Arbitrage: Leverage alternative data sources (e.g., satellite imagery, social sentiment) for unique market insights.

Weird, seeing this hurt a bit.  That was odd.  I wouldn't have expected that.
I used to think technical analysis is bullshit. I mean who doesn't know Buffet is the most successful investor? I didn't realize my foolishness until I leaned about Jim Simon and his Renaissance Technology. RIP genius.
In the context of string theory, a U(N) Chern‚ÄìSimons theory on an oriented Lagrangian 3-submanifold M of a 6-manifold X arises as the string field theory of open strings ending on a D-brane wrapping X in the A-model topological string theory on X. The B-model topological open string field theory on the spacefilling worldvolume of a stack of D5-branes is a 6-dimensional variant of Chern‚ÄìSimons theory known as holomorphic Chern‚ÄìSimons theory.

From gambling to trading, my experience over the years
Hello everyone,

I want to share with you some of the concepts behind the algorithmic trading setup I‚Äôve developed over the years, and take you through my journey up until today.

First, a little about myself: I‚Äôm 35 years old and have been working as a senior engineer in analytics and data for over 13 years, across various industries including banking, music, e-commerce, and more recently, a well-known web3 company.

Before getting into cryptocurrencies, I played semi-professional poker from 2008 to 2015, where I was known as a ‚Äúreg-fish‚Äù in cash games. For the poker enthusiasts, I had a win rate of around 3-4bb/100 from NL50 to NL200 over 500k hands, and I made about ‚Ç¨90,000 in profits during that time ‚Äî sounds like a lot but the hourly rate was something like 0.85‚Ç¨/h over all those years lol. Some of that money helped me pay my rent in Paris during 2 years and enjoy a few wild nights out. The rest went into crypto, which I discovered in October 2017.

I first heard about Bitcoin through a poker forum in 2013, but I didn‚Äôt act on it at the time, as I was deeply focused on poker. As my edge in poker started fading with the increasing availability of free resources and tutorials, I turned my attention to crypto. In October 2017, I finally took the plunge and bought my first Bitcoin and various altcoins, investing around ‚Ç¨50k. Not long after, the crypto market surged, doubling my money in a matter of weeks.

Around this time, friends introduced me to leveraged trading on platforms with high leverage, and as any gambler might, I got hooked. By December 2017, with Bitcoin nearing $18k, I had nearly $900k in my account‚Äî$90k in spot and over $800k in perps. I felt invincible and was seriously questioning the need for my 9-to-6 job, thinking I had mastered the art of trading and desiring to live from it.

However, it wasn‚Äôt meant to last. As the market crashed, I made reckless trades and lost more than $700k in a single night while out with friends. I‚Äôll never forget that night. I was eating raclette, a cheesy French dish, with friends, and while they all had fun, I barely managed to control my emotions, even though I successfuly stayed composed, almost as if I didn‚Äôt fully believe what had just happened. It wasn‚Äôt until I got home that the weight of the loss hit me. I had blown a crazy amount of money that could have bought me a nice apartment in Paris.

The aftermath was tough. I went through the motions of daily life, feeling so stupid, numb and disconnected, but thankfully, I still had some spot investments and was able to recover a portion of my losses.

Fast forward to 2019: with Bitcoin down to $3k, I cautiously re-entered the market with leverage, seeing it as an opportunity. This time, I was tried to be more serious about risk management, and I managed to turn $60k into $400k in a few months. Yet, overconfidence struck again and after a series of loss, I stopped the strict rule of risk management I used to do and tried to revenge trade with a crazy position ... which ended liquidated. I ended up losing everything during the market retrace in mid-2019. Luckily, I hadn‚Äôt touched my initial investment of ‚Ç¨50k and took a long vacation, leaving only $30k in stablecoins and 20k in alts, while watching Bitcoin climb to new highs.

Why was I able to manage my risk properly while playing poker and not while trading ? Perhaps the lack of knowledge and lack of edge ? The crazy amounts you can easily play for while risking to blow your account in a single click ? It was at this point that I decided to quit manual leverage trading and focus on building my own algorithmic trading system. Leveraging my background in data infrastructure, business analysis, and mostly through my poker experience. I dove into algo trading in late 2019, starting from scratch.

You might not know it, but poker is a valuable teacher for trading because both require a strong focus on finding an edge and managing risk effectively. In poker, you aim to make decisions based on probabilities, staying net positive over time, on thousands of hands played, by taking calculated risks and folding when the odds aren‚Äôt in your favor. Similarly, in trading, success comes from identifying opportunities where you have an advantage and managing your exposure to minimize losses. Strict risk management, such as limiting the size of your trades, helps ensure long-term profitability by preventing emotional decisions from wiping out gains.

It was decided, I would now engage my time in creating a bot that will trade without any emotion, with a constant risk management and be fully statistically oriented. I decided to implement a strategy that needed to think in terms of ‚Äúnet positive expected value‚Äù... (a term that I invite you to read about if you are not familiar with).

In order to do so, I had to gather the data, therefore I created this setup:

* I purchased a VPS on OVH, for 100$/month,
* I collected OHLCV data using python with CCXT on Bybit and Binance, on 1m, 15m, 1h, 1d and 1w timeframes. ‚Äî> this is the best free source library, I highly recommend it if you guys want to start your own bot
* I created any indicator I could read on online trading classes using python libraries
* I saved everything into a standard MySQL database with 3+ To data available
* I normalized every indicators into percentiles, 1 would be the lowest 1% of the indicator value, 100 the highest %.
* I created a script that will gather for each candle when it will exactly reach out +1%, +2%, +3%‚Ä¶ -1%, -2%, -3%‚Ä¶ and so on‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶ This last point is very important as I wanted to run data analysis and see how a trade could be profitable, ie. be net value positive. As an example, collecting each time one candle would reach -X%/+X% has made really easy to do some analysis foreach indicator.

Let's dive into two examples... I took two indicators: the RSI daily and the Standard Deviation daily, and over several years, I analyzed foreach 5-min candles if the price would reach first +5% rather than hitting -5%. If the win rate is above 50% is means this is a good setup for a long, if it's below, it's a good setup for a short. I have split the indicators in 10 deciles/groups to ease the analysis and readibility: "1" would contain the lowest values of the indicator, and "10" the highest.

Results:

https://preview.redd.it/3nmlgf2ctkod1.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b89710c62743517fc481e8cd08d6cabac42d16f

For the Standard Deviation, it seems that the lower is the indicator, the more likely we will hit +5% before -5%.

https://preview.redd.it/7g4k2qldtkod1.png?width=399&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f030a1c5c128e4eeedb3b1f14ed0baeecbd4a10

On the other hand, for the RSI, it seems that the higher is the indicator, the more likely we will hit +5% before -5%.

In a nutshell, my algorithm will monitor those statistics foreach cryptocurrency, and on many indicators. In the two examples above, if the bot was analyzing those metrics and only using those two indicators, it will likely try to long if the RSI is high and the STD is low, whereas it would try to short if the RSI was low and STD was high.

This example above is just for a risk:reward=1, one of the core aspects of my approach is understanding breakeven win rates based on many risk-reward ratios. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the theoretical win rates you need to achieve for different risk-reward setups in order to break even (excluding fees):

    ‚Ä¢Risk: 10, Reward: 1 ‚Üí Breakeven win rate: 90%
    ‚Ä¢Risk: 5, Reward: 1 ‚Üí Breakeven win rate: 83%
    ‚Ä¢Risk: 3, Reward: 1 ‚Üí Breakeven win rate: 75%
    ‚Ä¢Risk: 2, Reward: 1 ‚Üí Breakeven win rate: 66%
    ‚Ä¢Risk: 1, Reward: 1 ‚Üí Breakeven win rate: 50%
    ‚Ä¢Risk: 1, Reward: 2 ‚Üí Breakeven win rate: 33%
    ‚Ä¢Risk: 1, Reward: 3 ‚Üí Breakeven win rate: 25%
    ‚Ä¢Risk: 1, Reward: 5 ‚Üí Breakeven win rate: 17%
    ‚Ä¢Risk: 1, Reward: 10 ‚Üí Breakeven win rate: 10%

My algorithm‚Äôs goal is to consistently beat these breakeven win rates for any given risk-reward ratio that I trade while using technical indicators to run data analysis.

Now that you know a bit more about risk rewards and breakeven win rates, it‚Äôs important to talk about how many traders in the crypto space fake large win rates. A lot of the copy-trading bots on various platforms use strategies with skewed risk-reward ratios, often boasting win rates of 99%. However, these are highly misleading because their risk is often 100+ times the reward. A single market downturn (a ‚Äúblack swan‚Äù event) can wipe out both the bot and its followers. Meanwhile, these traders make a lot of money in the short term while creating the illusion of success. I‚Äôve seen numerous bots following this dangerous model, especially on platforms that only show the percentage of winning trades, rather than the full picture. I would just recommend to stop trusting any bot that looks ‚Äútoo good to be true‚Äù ‚Äî or any strategy that seems to consistently beat the market without any drawdown.

Anyways‚Ä¶ coming back to my bot development, interestingly, the losses I experienced over the years had a surprising benefit. They forced me to step back, focus on real-life happiness, and learn to be more patient and developing my very own system without feeling the absolute need to win right away. This shift in mindset helped me view trading as a hobby, not as a quick way to get rich. That change in perspective has been invaluable, and it made my approach to trading far more sustainable in the long run.

In 2022, with more free time at my previous job, I revisited my entire codebase and improved it significantly. My focus shifted mostly to trades with a 1:1 risk-to-reward ratio, and I built an algorithm that evaluated over 300 different indicators to find setups that offered a win rate above 50%. I was working on it days and nights with passion, and after countless iterations, I finally succeeded in creating a bot that trades autonomously with a solid risk management and a healthy return on investment. And only the fact that it was live and kind of performing was already enough for me, but luckily, it‚Äôs even done better since it eventually reached the 1st place during few days versus hundreds of other traders on the platform I deployed it. Not gonna lie this was one of the best period of my ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù life and best achievement I ever have done. As of today, the bot is trading 15 different cryptocurrencies with consistent results, it has been live since February on live data, and I just recently deployed it on another platform.

I want to encourage you to trust yourself, work hard, and invest in your own knowledge. That‚Äôs your greatest edge in trading. I‚Äôve learned the hard way to not let trading consume your life. It's easy to get caught up staring at charts all day, but in the long run, this can take a toll on both your mental and physical health. Taking breaks, focusing on real-life connections, and finding happiness outside of trading not only makes you healthier and happier, but it also improves your decision-making when you do trade. Stepping away from the charts can provide clarity and help you make more patient, rational decisions, leading to better results overall.

If I had to create a summary of this experience, here would be the main takeaways:

* Trading success doesn‚Äôt happen overnight, stick to your process, keep refining it, and trust that time will reward your hard work.
* detach from emotions: whether you are winning or losing, stick to your plan, emotional trading is a sure way to blow up your account.
* take lessons from different fields like poker, math, psychology or anything that helps you understand human behavior and market dynamics better.
* before going live with any strategy, test it across different market conditions,thereis no substitute for data and preparation
* step away when needed, whether in trading or life, knowing when to take a break is crucial. It‚Äôll save your mental health and probably save you a lot of money.
* not entering a position is actually a form of trading: I felt too much the urge of trading 24/7 and took too many losses b y entering positions because I felt I had to, delete that from your trading and you will already be having an edge versus other trades
* keep detailed records of your trades and analyze them regularly, this helps you spot patterns and continuously improve, having a lot of data will help you considerably.

I hope that by sharing my journey, it gives you some insights and helps boost your own trading experience. No matter how many times you face losses or setbacks, always believe in yourself and your ability to learn and grow. The road to success isn‚Äôt easy, but with hard work, patience, and a focus on continuous improvement, you can definitely make it. Keep pushing forward, trust your process, and never give up.
Nice read, but doesn't calculating percentiles for all backtesting data seems like a way to look forward and overfit your models?
Without disclosing your strategy, I have some questions. Would it be amazing if you could reply:


1 - I noticed cryto follows more trending than other assets. Is your strategy performing the same way in trending markets rather than side ways?

2 - If trending is the base of your strategy, have you back tested it in trending assets with less volatility but that you could eventually use more leverage per position as for example, S&P 500?

3 - I didn't fully understand if you use machine learning or systematic programming?

4 - In case you use machine learning, do you believe LSTM is the best for these types of predictions, or will you recommend something else?

5 - As an informative thing, I have, in my mind, an idea that hasn't been fully developed yet, which basically is to normalize prices based on ATR, and don't use price at all, where I will predict movements in factors of ATR, so that it can work intraday on the different trading sessions: Asia, London, New York for Gold, do you think it is the right path or am I overcomplicating it? Basically, my idea is that a model may find more patterns when data is:

+1.5ATR, -0.5ATR, 0.0ATR, etc. Where the number of columns of the model will be, let's say, the last 10 (ATR) prices on a given timeframe.

Thanks for your post. It is really informative. ;)
It doesn‚Äôt sound like you forward tested your strats.  Every ‚Äústatistics‚Äù based strat like these ones I ever tested failed a walk forward.  Good luck.
Wow just wow. Very impressive.
What would you advise for someone who is a complete beginner in trading (and i mean a beginner in everything)? What would you do if you had to start over to eventually know how to build a bot in trading.
Thanks for your story, but you probably make more profit per month with subscribers and copytrade fees than your overall YTD profit.
Cherry picking indicators from a massive amount of indicators with massive modeling efforts sounds like a sure way to overfit to said indicators.


That said I do feel like booting up my old crypto botting venture..
Wow , you‚Äôre one crazy genius. Thanx for this!
Hi, Im a us stock option trader. I make some decent profit over the last 3 years, albeit very small. my underlying are all stocks, so no crypto but trading basics are the same I suppose. I'm looking for ways to learn from r/algotrading better assist to make informed decisions such as position size, stock selection, strike price, expiration date DTE, etc. 

i recently dipped toe to python (w/ help from Chatgpt) to extract live data, I'm looking for ways to improve my trading. Any recommendations/suggestions would be appreciated. Thx
So the record shows your bot, starting from mid last year, has had drawdown to -20%, didn't do much until recently, had a big step up most recently. Other than the lackluster performance, it doesn't jive with your portrait of statistical advantage, does it?
Thank you. Keeping at it
Thank you for these tips and also thank you very much for sharing your story.
>¬†I built an algorithm that evaluated over 300 different indicators

Wow!!! I feel like a bit of an underachiever now but that's impressive.
Thanks for sharing! Great read!

I'm always curious about stats. Would you mind sharing how many trades does your bot make and what is expected value per trade?
Im stoked, thanks for sharing a small part of your lifestory, fellow builder here that has an on off relationship with building his algos and finally wants and needs to come back to finishing my system
Thanks for sharing. Don‚Äôt love seeing all the hate and skepticism you‚Äôre getting from some. You‚Äôre just trying to help and spread some good energy. Everything you said makes sense and I don‚Äôt see any holes or scamminess. The statistical approach you laid out checks out for me. I think about things very similarly. Really glad to hear about your success. Gives myself and others optimism in our own journeys. Keep up the good work!!

PS check out Cursor AI
Hello, congrats, can you give us a little bit more of info?

What was your first platform and why you moved to the one you are using now? What is the one you use now? Drawbacks and benefics?

Which yield you have right now? I guess you mean it is steady daily? intra-week? montly? yearly? Can you give us some real data on profit % on months since Feb?
This is pure gold, never delete this post please
You should write a book with this storyüò©
This is incredible. I‚Äôm a beginner and I‚Äôve only do a few pinescripts and MQL5 EAs. Anymore tips for starting out when developing everything from scratch. I saw you used Python. How did you develop all those indicators? 300 is crazy so how did you even come up with the list for the strategies? Dumb question but if you had to list everything in order what would you do first and how would that help the next step in the process?
Absolute banger of a piece thank you for your insight ! Have you ever used Cumulative Volume Delta as an indicator ? Do you have any recommendations on that front ? Thanks in advance.
can you further explain what do you mean by breaking indicators into percentile? and what does 1-10 means for example rsi 14?

also if you dont use ML, do you test each and every 308 indicator?
I liked it OP great work
Nice job.
Hey OP

Thanks what an interesting read ! Love the lessons you described and shared that you‚Äôve learnt across this journey. If I wanted to copy trade the bot, how can I do this ? Is it available on any platforms ?

Thanks!
But why in Paris ? This is not the same city as before .
If we were back to 2019, with both experience you had ( poker and algo trading) would you try to start a career in poker or algo trading ? And could you explain why ? 
Thanks for your time :)
Thanks for sharing. I find similarities to myself there. 
My main challenge in algotrading is figuring out the right combination of indicators. I find a lot that adding indicator X to my existing algo might improve  it, adding indicator Y improves it, but both together don't. Not quite sure how to and if to combine them
Any thoughts?
thanks for the read! how did you / do you backtest your strategies? did you design your own engine? how many variations / deviations per indicator you backtest at once?
Thanks for the detailed share.
Hey, thanks for sharing. Certainly one of the best posts here in a while with lot of valuable content.

I was wondering if your trades are purely based on 1D statistics (my understanding) or if you add price action to locate entry and exit points (support/resistance based on pivots, volume profile, monthly levels..). Thanks!

Wow - what an amazing read. This took me on a journey with my own trading career. I only now, after 7 years of trading am consistent in profits. So, you have a profitable system! I have no idea how to build a bot or anything like that (i've never studied it) but what i have done is taken an indicator (free) and tweaked that with risk management for it to yield 2% on my account value, a day. This has always been my goal! Making ¬£100 ten times in a day sounds so simple, but how difficult it was!!!! It only happened when i began thinking about what i was thinking about, deeply and asking myself all of the hard pressing questions. Funnily enough, it was when i started studying Prince2 that i saw the value in checking my system for improvements! Hats off to you! I would buy your system just because of the back story!!

I indeed over-fitted my models a lot back then haha! I was not initially very aware of what it was as I did not really studied machine learning and was lazy to but fortunately, when chatGPT came it helped me a lot understanding the concepts and making it easier for me to know what was badly conceived in my infrastructure.

Actually percentiles are indeed too wide to use, and I'm more using them to normalize each indicator's scale. But  this scaling system has to be carefully thought and adapted, as an example I used to create percentiles on volatility in 2020 when bitcoin was hyper-volatile compared to now. Let's consider that  back then that outliers would be a -10% or  +10% price movement intra-day. My percentile scale from 1 to 100 from back then would scale 1 a price movement  under -10% and 100 a move over  +10%, but this is not existing  anymore on  Bitcoin since the market isn't as volatile as before. So  I had  to review my system because scales were skewed. 

I won't go too much into the details on how  I reviewed the scales though, that's part of the "secret sauce" ...
I used a combination of ML models and weighted them by percentage. Since I trade on the 1-minute time frame, I realized that if I heavily weight models that are overfitting, they can predict very accurately. However, there is one model that produces good results but cannot predict the price precisely. I‚Äôm still unsure if overfitting affects the overall outcome. I might be wrong in weighting the overfitting model up to 60%.
1- My strategy is trying to find the best expected value for a given setup, and you said it correctly, trending in crypto is generally the way to go, my bot is trying to detect a trending pattern and follows it. However if the trend is bullish but we hit a resistance, it might take a swing short, and  vice versa if the trend was bearish, it  would try to long on a support. 

  
2- Unfortunately no, I am sticking to crypto as I am not familiar with the world of US market, I did not know where to find granular OHLCV data in lower than 1D periods. So nope, never tried on SP500 or more traditional markets.

  
3-  I tried  to use machine learning but I did not successfully make it, instead I have a homemade composite scoring on my indicators, rating indicators positively (long) or negatively (short) and the "magic formula"  will trigger  a  long  or short signal depending on the expected net  values. It's a homemade kind of  reinforcement learning.

4- I tried  neural networks and  other kind but never  successfully achieved anything, and also the big problem with machine learning models is that I do not understand them and  cannot  really master the  way to finetune parameters accurately. This is why  I do not use them. 

5- I'm not confident on the way Asia, London, NY ... sessions are  behaving  independently,  but yes, I can tell you that  you are on  something. Raw prices are generally bad to  be used as is, and ATR  is a really good indicator, at  least when it comes to crypto :)

hope this helps!
I am not sure why you think I did not. I do have an asynchronous system that analyze year by year optimal parameters and forecast how it performs over the next years, it helped me building a weight system for each of my indicators, a kind of ‚Äútrusting score‚Äù based on my rules.
It sounds like you overfit your backtests
Thank you for the kind words.   
First of all I would advise to keep away from futures/perp trading, there is too much temptation to trade with high leverage and blow your account. Only use perps if you know what you are doing and if you have a strategy. I paid it the high price back then and I regret it very much still today.

Now if I had to start over by learning trading at first, I would read/watch every day nice content about trading, this is your best way to learn, to copy-cat someone's thinking process and to later apply it to your own graphs. I still do watch some good youtubers, not to copy their trades but to see how they trade, inspire myself with new techniques and new indicators. Obviously at the beginning you might fall for influencers or stupid traders promoting their channels with titles like "HOW TO MAKE x10 EACH YEAR BY DAY TRADING" - just ignore those guys and pick modest ones, that have a way of thinking that suits you, and watch them everyday and compare their results to the market. 

Finally, if I had to start over at building a bot from scractch again, I would pass a fair amount of time on my infrastructure, I'm not a developer and it took me a very long time to achieve something fast enough to rely my algorithmic trading system on. So I would definitely learn much more about programming skills. And then basic maths. You can watch the video "The maths of winning in trading" from the youtube channel "the art of trading", I recommend this video to anyone that would like to start to understand basic maths and how to think in terms of "edge" in order to create a winning system. 

If you do not have any technical background, I prefer to be honest, it will be very difficult to build a bot from scratch. There some solutions like Pinescripts using tradingview, but I personally dislike it and I'm probably not the best to comment on it.

Hope this helps!
I actually don‚Äôt sell my bot for a subscription fees, only crooks are doing this. More and more platforms are opting for a performance fees instead, where only profits generated for your subscribers can generate you some profits as you take a cut on it.

That‚Äôs also why there is now a lot of traders with skewed win rates, so they can win a little profit on each closed trades and leverage this performance fee for them.
Depends on the way you cherry pick, back then I was only using indicators with strong performances and I indeed fell into overfitting! I improved the way I select my vindicators based on 1) their performances obvisouly, 2) how did they behave in bull, bear and range market (I have a selector based on the type of period we are in) and 3) based on the number of occurrences I have with this indicator's value.  
As an example, if indicator "A" provided me a winning rate of 60% in 2021,2022,2023 but 40% in 2024, I genuily prefer to select an indicator "B" that performed regularly at 55% in all those years.   
I'm able to create a min/max win rate by indicator, and based on this interval, you can create basic confidence intervals to predict as estimate win rate (with a confidence of 95% for example).

Some ideas on why to use a 95% confidence interval : [https://www.simplypsychology.org/confidence-interval.html#What-is-a-95-confidence-interval](https://www.simplypsychology.org/confidence-interval.html#What-is-a-95-confidence-interval)
‚ÄúCherry picking‚Äù is a great way to find performant indicators as long as you do properly validation and backtesting
He comments that he is ‚Äúnot here to promote his services‚Äù, and the next line is ‚Äúi charge a 20% fee‚Äù. lmao
Get historical data
Everything before 2024 was a live testing acvount, the 20% drawdown was due to a misconfiguration with over leverage (10x versus 3x as of today). I fixed that mid March, and since that date I‚Äôm up 70% with a drawdown of 15% while the market went through a -20% on bitcoin and -30%+ on some alts, so yes, I call that an edge until now ;). 

And I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs your point of your comment, I‚Äôm not here to brag or get any more subscribers, I‚Äôm here to share my experience and what I went through. From what it‚Äôs worth, having a live bot even under performing is something I‚Äôm really proud of. It started as a hobby to heal from the crazy losses I had, and it turned out to be a profitable hobby, at least until today.
Thank you!

I exactly have 77 unique indicators, and all of them are analyzed in 4 different timeframes: 15m, 1-hour, 1-day and 1-week. So that's a total of 308 indicators, I cheated a bit while writting this :)

Thank you, I really appreciate your words mate!You cannot change some people‚Äôs minds, but that‚Äôs okay, I don‚Äôt need to prove them anything, all of want is talk about algotrading, which is the point of this forum..!
Hey sure!

I wanted to trade on the platform where my bot is deployed because I think they are the fairest for subscribers as each of those platforms provide either a z-score analyzing deeply each trader‚Äô trading style or by providing an access to the live positions on the other one. I always preferred transparency especially that it also forces you and challenges you to create a performing bot, as you are competing with other traders to win some visibility. Otherwise you do no exist. 

Platforms like Bybit for copy trading are a black box for the subscribers as it‚Äôs only showing winning rates and realized gains without disclosing unrealized pnl which could be really bad! I think this is misleading and intended, I did not want to be associated to this kind of trading platform.

For the live stats, since march, I have shared the winning % of my algo in this comment : https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/s/RdUUPESPQh

Otherwise you can access the live results of my bot through my profile by filtering on the last 6 months on the platform to have the full picture.

Hope this helps!
Thank you, I appreciate the comment! 

When it comes to developing everything on your own you need to have good technical skills. Python is not over-complex and it's used by a lot of people so you might always find someone that created libraries, free to use. 

For example, just by searching quickly right now, I found this library that provides technical indicators in python: [https://technical-analysis-library-in-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://technical-analysis-library-in-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 

Now, regarding the indicators, I have written this in another comment but  I only have 77 indicators, but they are constantly analyzed in different timeframes, so that's a bit more than 300 if you count them separately, haha!

Also, the most important  library I'm using is CCXT, it provided me a really easy way to use platform's API and collect OHLCV data as it provided a couple of examples. The documentation is clear, and I think that a lot of algo traders on crypto are using this library.

Now for the most important thing to achieve: 

- Create a database, or any other sustainable system that will help you analysing data

- Create your scripts to collect raw data (OHLCV) 

- Create your indicators in the desired timeframes you want to trade on. I do not suggest to trade under 15 minutes as it's very challenging to gather raw data, treat it and execute a trade accordingly to the open/close of the last bar you are  dealing with. The lower the timeframe, the harder

- Think of a system and test it (you will need a backtesting system, create your own or use a library online) 

- Repeat the last step until you found what you needed :) 

  
Good luck!
Hey sire, I actually did not implement the CVD since I was not really understanding its concept back then but I have other volume indicators like the OBV or the force index.
I cannot really help you on this one sorry, but just a quick insight I found while analyzing volume indicators, it only really worked when volatility AND volume is very low, other than that I did not really find them that useful except on high timeframes like the weekly chart
sorry as i dont quite understand the part where u normalize indicators into percentiles
I was young and living in the suburbs, all I wanted was to live in a big city, and definitely fell in love with Paris at the beginning. It‚Äôs different now ‚Ä¶ haha
It‚Äôs actually a very good and funny question. With my actual knowledge of poker I would not be able to win enough in order to professionally live from it, the level is really hard nowadays and especially in Europe since they increased the rake (the commmission taken by the poker website on each hand - or tournament if playing mtt). It‚Äôs very difficult and needs a lot of (boring) work today to be profitable at poker, lurking during hours at various variance simulator in order to play the perfect GTO type of game. Not gonna lie, it‚Äôs not fun. However, if you give me my actual knowledge ok poker and I could teleport back in 2006 or 2007 when poker started to rise online, it would be a snap and could have won millions I genuinely think. But today, and even in 2019, I would choose algotrading because you can dig into data really much more, find an edge using data, or even just have fun developing your strategy. But to be honest it‚Äôs also really hard to find a winning strategy that you can live from, it requires a lot of effort and energy before generating revenues. So that‚Äôs a very difficult question. If I did not have my professional life nearby, I would probably try to live from MTT at poker as I think this is where the level is the easiest to play (even though the variance can be crazy), and I would put a lot of effort developing my algotrading solution nearby.
TLDR; if I could keep my actual job and had to choose between poker and algotrading back in 2019, I‚Äôd choose algotrading as a side hobby. If I had to choose what I would like to live from without any professional revenue, I‚Äôd do a mix: poker in MTT to grind some cash, then focusing on algotrading hopefully to find a good strategy. But focusing only on algotrading and hoping to generate revenues while having no other source of income nearby and having expanses at the same time would be insanely crazy 
(F*ck my tldr is actually super long‚Ä¶)
I do have the same conclusions than you, if you combine the extremes values of a given indicator which are over performing to the same top values of another indicator, most generally it won‚Äôt simply work as they often are not occurring together a lot. For example, RSI >= 9 and STD <= 2 are not happening this much because high RSI generally means the volatility is quite high. However if it does occur I still expect it to be a good setup, but perhaps not the best setup from the two indicators combined together. The main reason is because a single indicator tells you a story and provides you optimal setup for a good trend confirmation for example. Its telling you the beginning of one story that you are trying to guess, and the more you combine indicators, the more confirmations you‚Äôll generally get from various indicators which are lagging, thus you might be too late to the party to have the optimal setup and perhaps are a bit ‚Äúoverfitting‚Äù your actual result. It does not mean that you can‚Äôt find good correlations between indicators, but it most certainly means that the best combinations of several indicators are not that trivial to find and need you to backtest a lot.
Not sure if what I wrote makes sense lol, let me know and I‚Äôll try to be clearer
Hello sire, yes I do, I have designed my backtest engine. It‚Äôs taking a lot of time but globally, I‚Äôm selecting the best indicators for mythe asset I‚Äôm trading given specific statistics, then I‚Äôm backtesting / forward testing them automatically over several periods and logging the ROI and DD over the tested periods. I‚Äôm able to then select my strategies which I find the most adequate. So I have a continuous testing engine that scans hundreds of strategies with small or bigger variations over my indicators. 
Hope this makes sense.
Hey! Thank you for the feedback
Nope, I‚Äôm testing 77 indicators on several timeframes: 15min, 1h, 1d and 1w. Generally the higher timeframes are giving me an overall trend / expected value, and the system uses lower timeframes to optimize the entry.
I do have a script that calculates supports and resistances and they are considered into the trading system, which sometimes will consider them, sometimes won‚Äôt. But the overall rule: it‚Äôs shorting resistances and longing supports as this is statistically proven that you have more fakeouts than breakouts.

The normal way of handling this would be to normalise everything using ‚ÄúZScores‚Äù so that movements are a percentage of (rolling) std-dev.

With a suitable half-life the Zscore range will be the same for both volatile and quiet markets.
Thanks for clarification, now it makes more sense. I think it's pretty obvious that scales should be dynamically updated. I tried something like this before, but it felt wrong for me, like brute forcing the market. Maybe I'll continue my indicator games while my main strategy is being tested.
 give "rolling percentile" a go
How often does your system trade? With the fees on crypto I can‚Äôt imagine it‚Äôs more than a few times per day?
I didn't say I think you didn't, I said it "sounds like" you didnt, because you never mentioned that in your story or your guide.  Let me ask a different question.  Since it's statistics based, what are the chances these "statistics" simply revert to a coin toss eventually?  You say that you do a forecast of performance, does the actual match the forecast over a large sample?
yeah, many of them
Saved the comment. Appreciate it
Can you list your recommendations for YouTube channels?
> First of all I would advise to keep away from futures/perp trading, there is too much temptation to trade with high leverage and blow your account. Only use perps if you know what you are doing and if you have a strategy. 

Are perps any more risky than conventional futures?

Aside from the fact that futures basically require margin to participate I don't see them as ultra risky. You can trade lower lots, minis, micros, etc to reduce margin usage. Futures can move with a lot of momentum, but that's part of their appeal for a trader.

I think way more people have blown their accounts recently from options than futures. If you don't have a defined or tested stratgy and risk management going in and you use leverage, you're going to be cooked. That goes with any trading instrument. I don't see how futures or perps are any different, but let me know if there's something I'm missing.
You have subscription for calls on discord and a 20% performance fee on the bot. 

I wonder if you have such a good return then why not trade for yourself and rely on fees and subs?
I am not promoting my bot in this post, and I do not need people to trust me. But yes, if people are asking, yes there are a 10% and 20% performance fee depending on the platform, better to be transparent. 

Do you expect people that worked for years on something personal to give it away for free ? Would saying ‚ÄúI charge a 0% fee‚Äù be more convenient to you ?
The motive for putting your bot on zignaly is plenty clear. No explanation is needed. A sales pitch with a personal story wrapped around it seems to be more effective. As for your past performance, there are always good reasons after the fact. You thought you fixed it. The next extinction event will come. I will keep an eye on it for the next two years.
Curious to know how you would go about doing that?
That‚Äôs wild! Did you happen to test bollinger bands in your tests? If so, did you find anything interesting?
Data by month: 

2024-3|204|134|0.6569  
2024-4|275|202|0.7345

But would you use it independently or in conjunction with another indicator ?
I do test all of my indicators yes, and make advanced stats about their performances in order to cherry pick them accordingly.

I detailed a bit more in one of the comments how i use the percentiles, but basically it splits all the values recorded of the indicator into 100 buckets in order to have the exact same number of candles within each group.
Thanks for the detailed reponse. I'm passionate about poker since 15 years old and in 2019 when I started studying in class prepa to get into French engineering school I asked myself this questions. Should I try to go for a professional poker career? At the end, reading on forums I realized that the online level was increasing so fast. I also remember a thread a on french poker forum by batmax about the bots in poker especially in high variance and short deep formats like spin and go. So I realised that it was becoming so important to know how to code and that studying math and computer science will help me to have a more diversified background and thus choose later what I'll do. But same as you, I'm 100% that if I would have been 18 or early 20 around 2010 I would have go for a poker career either live or online. It seems like until 2016 there was a lot a lot a lot of easy money to do with poker.  At the end, I'm  graduating from a quantitative master degree, looking for a quant job, and I think I'll start poker again, has a hobby but seriously. Will be easier since I'll have a job next to that and so I won't be under the pressure of generating revenues to live.
Again thanks for your answer!!
Yeah it makes sense. 
So you're saying that other than a lot of backtesting, there's not much to do here?

One thing I did try which seems to work is to fine tune parameters per symbol or market
That is interesting. I use the > daily timeframes in my algos as well to assemble a watchlist, but more based on price action and few indicators, less statistics. I need to look into that more. My intraday entries for the selected stocks are based on indicators + S/R + zones (void that is flanked by heavy S/R). Agree with the shorting R and longing S. 

Anyhow, I am impressed that your strat with mainly statistical focus has an edge because I was always under the impression that, if so, quants would have already solved it. I am trying to incorporate my traders mindset/rules/gut feeling into code but that is tricky for the last 10% of the criteria.
I think we have the same concept of making a trend indicator at a higher time frame while entries at a lower time frame. This approach really improves my risk to reward ratios. I still trade manually since I don't know much  about coding. But your posts inspire me to try to learn how to automate my systems. I have a lot of trading systems but trading them manually is really tiring.

Btw out of 77 indicators, which one is the best?
[removed]
It‚Äôs trading approximately one trade each 2 days per crypto, and I also analyze funding rates in order to get paid more often
My bad, I should probably have mentioned it.   
Obviously I cannot predict if my strategies will 100% adapt in months from now or still be more profitable than a 50/50, but I do know that I have created a system that can re-balance my strategies based on recent events if I need to. As of today my live strategy since March 2024 is using data from 2019 until March 2023 (it ignored the last rolling year as I wanted to see it in live data). In terms of volumes, I have more than 300k candles to play with accurately, however some indicators' groups (when combined together) do not have a strong sample of candles, so I'm just ignoring them to avoid any kind of false positive signals.
French traders I genuily like for their style and process thinking:   
- Les Rois du Bitcoin  
- Crypto Le Trone

Youtube channels I like when it comes to explain concepts of trading:   
- The art of trading  
- Trading Rush  
- IManTrading ==> funny guy showing the obvious scams on copy trading
And for the discord, it‚Äôs because I made everything free (with a 12 hour delay), the paid version is only if users would like to use it on their own trading system and have real time calls (and Im not advising it - and do not have any users paying it right now as it‚Äôs more interesting to go live on my bot). I won‚Äôt provide a real time winning strategy for free.
I don‚Äôt have any subscription calls on the platforms, but I indeed have a 20% performance fee on one platform and 10% on another.

Investing on your own bot is cool, especially if you know it‚Äôs performing, but it‚Äôs not a ‚Äúget rich quick‚Äù kind of thing especially if you start with a small capital. I personally invested 20K‚Ç¨ in my bot, and I‚Äôm not planning to invest more right now. I expect to hopefully reach a +50% in average per year (it‚Äôs a very solid ROI and can‚Äôt tell you yet if it‚Äôs sustainable in the long term). With 20K, 50% apy, and the compounding interests it would take approximately 10 years to reach 1M+.

I deployed this bot initially for my family and some close friends, and since it‚Äôs performing pretty nicely so far (+70% since March), I opened it recently to new users so I could also enjoy a performance fee that could help me compounding faster.

Obviously people do not have to trust me and I would not trust me if I were you, but it is what it is, sometimes you can find winning strategies because the owner wants to get paid for it ‚Äî I‚Äôm not here to promote my services, but I‚Äôm here to share my experience in developing a strategy but also point out that copy trading services are not full of scams, there are some good traders out there that want to leverage their work faster.
‚ÄúI actually don‚Äôt sell my bot for a subscription fees, only crooks are doing this.‚Äú
Says you. I won‚Äôt have any financial freedom thanks to this platform, just a little bit more of compounding interests (if and only if the strategy is performing), as I already answered to another person. And why did I choose this platform and not something like Bybit where all copy traders are ? Because on Zignaly they do show unrealized pnl to subscribers which is the fairest data. I also think the z-score they provide can give information to users about which traders is likely to be better compared to another. I‚Äôm also an active member on their community and I advised to review the z-score, which they will do in a matter of weeks if not days to extend it to 365 days versus 180 days. This will decrease my bot‚Äôs visibility by a lot, but I genuinely don‚Äôt care.

If I really wanted a cash grab copy trading system, I would just create a bot that trades with skewed win rates as explained in my thread.

But be my guest, come frequently on the platform to check out its performance. Or even go to my discord, every announcement I made can prove you that my real version went live in March.

And to everyone else reading this: do not invest in my bot, I don‚Äôt need it. If you really want to, wait for an additional 6 months from now to wait for extra confirmation and invest if you feel like the bot can be profitable. I don‚Äôt need your money, I‚Äôm doing just fine.

Btw, I‚Äôm curious, did you lose crazy amounts on following random traders to feel that embittered by someone sharing his experience ? Crazy to see some random dudes like you bashing people trying to share algotrading‚Äôs data or thinking processes on an algotrading‚Äôs forum.
Thank you!
Bollinger bands are a very cool indicator and yes, the bigger are the bands (distance from lower to upper) the less edge my bot is having a statistical edge. I interpret it as is: the more the market is volatile, the bigger will be the bands, and during extreme high volatility, the market will be extremely choppy, and launching any coin toss will be totally random during that time. 
My algo is using bollinger bands not to detect a trend, but to avoid trading in very high volatility periods. 
On the opposite, extremely low volatility is when my bot is having much more edge, because false positive signals are less likely to occur. I can be wrong but this is what my data tells me!
Hope this helps!
I would not use CVD by itself, generally traders are likely to combine several types of indicators categories combined together.   
There are several categories of indicators:  
- trend indicators: supertrend indicator, moving averages (MA / EMAs), average directional index (ADX), ...  
- momemtum indicators: RSI, oscillators (like MACD for example), rate of change (ROC) ...  
- volatility/volume indicators: bollinger bands, ATR, on-balance volume (OBV), Standard Deviation (STD), CVD ...

I would say picking one within each category sounds like a good approach rather than just focusing on one category, but I'm not a pro trader. When I used to trade, I was using basically just MACD + triple moving averages and support / resistance.
wow do you mean that you actually wrote a backtest strategy to normalize every indicator based on percentile to see which indicator is useful to trade? So that you can then create some kind of weightage for your algo to decide on every min or so in live trading? hence creating some sort of dynamic ta trade style? 



one last question. do you actually set stoploss or your algo actively monitors it?
This is this forum I‚Äôm coming from as well
Zootard for life ;)
Happy to discuss about your poker journey one day or even your quant job
Correct, and I do not have the same strategy across several assets. I have only one live strategy with its own parameters per asset, finetuned based on the best asset‚Äôs indicators ROI
[removed]
It sounds to me that you're betting that a coin that has landed on heads 60% of the time will continue to land on heads 60% of the time.  But like that meme where the guy does an advanced skateboard move on a rake.  Be careful and good luck.
where do you deploy these bots? are there any platforms for stocks and options too?
I don‚Äôt sell a subscription fee. Learn to distinguish performance fee from subscription fee kiddo.
There are a lot of signal sellers, course sellers, mentorship sellers, scammers out there. Suspicion is normal. You should expect suspicion. If you are legit, you would embrace criticism. Zignaly appears to do a good job at keeping things transparent. They make you put your skin in the game by requiring you to trade a live account with them. Thumbs up for them, although they don't make you put a lot of skins in the game. Only you know your true motive. Being defensive and attacking makes you more suspicious. Regarding the performance of your bot, it's way too early to claim victory. I am just a passerby making my comments.
Oh very interesting! I can definitely see how that would be helpful in your scenario. I don‚Äôt algotrade yet but love reading this to get ideas and possible inspiration to make my own algo one day. Have you tried pairing it up with something like the rsi and/or macd? Thats typically what I‚Äôm looking for in my normal trading
Makes a lot of sense ! Have you had any difficulty in getting order books data from brokers ? As mentioned before I am trying to see if I can get CVD data either directly or by calculating it ? Any broker recommendations ? Thanks again. Really appreciate your replies
That is correct this is almost like you described, each of my cryptocurrency i am trading runs for weeks before being to be live traded, it takes a lot of time to simulate all of the indicators‚Äô s outcome.

And yes, each trade has a fixed SL and a fixed TP
[removed]
Sounds like it yes, but you can use confidence intervals to create an expected win rate based on a consistent sample of data. I wrote another comment about this!
Agree. I‚Äôm still trying to understand this post. If he‚Äôs only using recent data (5yr look back), his strat would have to be on such a low time frame. Even then, not accounting for macro changes is the death of even great trading algos
I'm not familiar with all the existing platforms, and for the ones I targeted it's because I think they are genuily promoting traders that are trying to make performant bot. To respect the principles of this subreddit I won't promote the platforms, but you can find them.

For the stocks and options I'm a noob, I really did not do any research on it, sorry!
if you were actually making money off the value you provide, you wouldnt need to be attempting to market your ‚Äúservices‚Äù on reddit for a performance fee
I am embracing constructive criticism. Your sentence "*The motive for putting your bot on zignaly is plenty clear. No explanation is needed. A sales pitch with a personal story wrapped around it seems to be more effective.*" was aggressive and not constructive at all, of course I will be defensive after such words.

Anyways, I agree with you, 6 months is nothing at all, and I won't claim victory until the bot has lived through a various type of market trends. And to be 100% transparent, I do not expect the bot to be as performant in a bull market than a bear market surprisingly so I will closely monitor what happens over the next cycle and will adjust accordingly some parameters if I have to.

There are people out there commenting about the possibility to be overfitted or the setups I use, or even the indicators that are performing based on my experience, I'm happy to answer all those questions and be fully transparent with the data I own if it can help anyone. I just wanted to underline with this thread that creating a performing bot, even in a bear market, is doable. If this can help someone out here in this community to start their own algotrading journey, I'd more than happy.
yeah actually getting order books is pretty difficult I would say since you need to query a lot of various exchanges, and my guess is that you need a very good infrastructure in order to collect the order books as frequently as you can, while calculating the CVS as well at the same time.   
I never tried to work with order book except when it comes to entering a trade in order to estimate the slippage

If I get it correct, by weighting the parameter, you are using recent data to calculate the wining statistics of each indicator, or put more weight in recent data.
I‚Äôm trading mostly 15-min timeframe, I tried 5-min but it‚Äôs too noisy and it‚Äôs challenging to create a robust infrastructure that analyze my data quickly in order to trade that fast. 
I have regular high timeframe checkups (1d, 1w) to help my trading system on a low timeframe, and each indicator is individually backtested and forwarded tested, I then proceed to create advanced stats for all of them such as min or max yearly win rate, APY, confidence intervals of expected win rates, variance between APYs, malus on indicators that are underperforming more recently, and many more. And this scoring system allows me to dynamically incorporate or remove indicators based on their real-time backtest and forward tests results.
Hope this makes sense
Not sure you understand anything, or clearly you did not read what I‚Äôve written, but hey, you do you bud.
ok fair enough. although i feel that if the broker's books are large enough, you don't necessarily need to query multiple exchanges at the same time.
[removed]
[removed]
[removed]
Almost correct, rather than weighting it, if the stats for a given indicator are bad on the recent datasets, with a considerable sample of trades, it gets a malus. This way I‚Äôm ignoring some indicators that might impact the performances and keeping as is the others
we get it.  its just that like, if some combination of RSI or MACD was successful in the past year, why would it continue to be going forward?  for what reason?
[removed]
[removed]
[removed]
I automatically select the indicators that are working and ignoring those that don‚Äôt, at least this is the core objective of my system, at least what he tries to do. It‚Äôs a dynamic tool that backtest and forward test daily all the indicators.
If RSI and MACD are not working anymore it won‚Äôt be used. And the selected combined indicators are generally selected upon a much larger period, they must successfully win several years straight in order to be considered by the system.

there's basically zero chance this actually works.  I've backtested it myself and it was just random.

8 things I've learned (1 Year of being Profitable)
I understand that I myself am a newb, but hopefully some newbier people can take some things away from this.

  
-Diversification is the most important critical factor(1)

-Risk Management is the second(2)

-Small Profits are profits(3)

-ALWAYS forward test on a paper account(4)

-Treat it like a hobby not a career(5)

-Pattern Day Trading Protection is protection for firms, not for a small trader(6)

-There is no way to get rich quick, patience is important(7)

-Good strategies are great strategies (8)

1. Having a losing position really sucks, but if you have 4 losing positions and 6 winning ones, then you have 2 winning positions, which is twice as good as 1 winning position.

  
2. Again a losing position is BAD, but is it worse to lose 50% of your portfolio on a bad trade, or 1%?

3. Would you rather take a 0.5% gain? Or risk that 0.5% you gained for 0.25% more? Personally I'd rather just take the 0.5%. Those small in and out trades are awesome. I spent too long worrying about the buy and hold comparison. Does it profit? Then it's profits baby. Does it not perform a lot of trades? I'd hook it up to more tickers. 

4. In my earlier days, I found the Holy Grail! (aka repainting to hell), hooked it up to my account, went to work, and thought I'd come home to endless riches. Except I came home to a nuked account. Other times it had been bugged code not properly executing closes causing loss, stuff like that. 

5. This ties into #7 a bit, but I thought it was my immediate future, in 3 months me and my wife could retire on an island. When that (obviously) didn't happen, then came the depression. I thought my future was over. Now I have a more laissez-faire approach. "Oh cool, that's neat" type of beat, rather than staking my happiness on it. Mental health is going to be huge to your development. Take breaks, relax. 

6. Self explanatory, but the amount of times I've lost money when I couldn't close a position due to PDTP is absurd. Didn't want to, but wrote a check for this in my script. The law was passed to prevent GME type situations (look how well that worked) and to gatekeep small traders from becoming big ones. (Honestly not a tip for traders just wanted to rant about this.)

7.  Okay maybe there is a way to get rich quick, but I certainly couldn't find it. Either way, investment firms cream at the idea of 0.5% gains a week, except there isn't the supply for them to make trades at that frequency with the capital they're working with. This is good for you, because it means you can. 0.5% a week consistently beats even the best index funds.

8. Similar to 3 (and 5, and 7 I guess),  I spent too long looking for the Holy Grail. In reality all I needed was something that works consistently, and there is a massive catalog of that available already. I found a good strategy, tweaked it for 10 tickers, and enjoyed. Had I done that 2 years ago I'd be 2 years profitable instead of 1. 

Messy rambling, but hopefully some find it helpful.






This is amazing man. Really happy you are finally profitable! I‚Äôm looking to do the same, have a few questions for you:

1. Are your strategies purely TA based or do you have fundamental strategies and/or sentiment analysis in there?
2. Couldn‚Äôt you bypass PDPT with a cash account? Or do you use margins?
3. Do you have any wisdom to share on risk management? I.e. how much percentage of your account do you use for a single trade? Is it fixed, or a function of how confident you are in the trade?
Do you trade your strategies only on certain market regimes?  If so, how do you determine the regimes?
Where do you run your Algo ? What is your stack
Based on my experience I love this advice. Especially the themes of not over-complicating things into oblivion and managing your mental health throughout the journey.
Let‚Äôs see the chart then
Can you talk more about your backtesting and asset selection?

1. How did you select your tickers? Did you have a strategy for selecting tickers based on some backtest results? Or scanned the sectors manually looking at fundamentals? Something else? 
2. How far back did you backtest for the assets you trade live?
3. What indicators did you focus on in backtests?
Thanks for sharing all of this. And well done! üëè üëè üëè
Thank you for sharing.
This is nitpicky, 1 is a subset of 2, you can manage risk by diversifying
My man.
Thanks for sharing your thoughts. But an even bigger thanks for your engagement in the comments! 
The way you‚Äôre sharing specific implementation details is refreshing. I even saw a line of code! A lot of people would guard any and all details like it was their proprietary secret. I think your comments are providing as much help to the community as your OP lol. 
Great job!
this was incredible to read. also goes to show the advances in the industry and how accessible trading is for everyone. keep at it and try ur hand at the futures mkt, theres no pdt rules there. also look into options on futures, even better capital efficiency. there's a million ways to skin a cat, but longevity in this game is based off risk mgmt. that's always gonna be first and foremost. "think risk first, reward second" -- prof. jeff beirman (theotrade instructor)
0.5% per week is insanely high, seems too good to be true without taking lots of risk
Newbie here, what was your starting background when it comes to programming? 

Spending time at the moment with writing the code, taking long as I am not a programmer.
Any good books you'd recommend? Either Algo or traditional investment.
What is the check for the PDTP in your script? Can you override it somehow if you spot it happening? I appreciate your rant, glad you've shared it üôå
Awesome feedback, I have a similar experience. 
Happy it worked out the way you wanted!
You sir are a chad
What do you recommend for a massive catalog of strategies that work? I see a lot of concepts mentoned but nothing that express that as an algorithm (if this then...)
Awesome post! Thanks for sharing your experience. I can relate it to mine: searching for the holy grail, getting too excited, dreaming about lambos, and losing money to bugs. After a year, I've finally settled on some sensible strategies. They won't make me rich overnight, but they're good enough to pay my bills.

Could you share one or two of your recent trades? There‚Äôs no need for screenshots‚Äîjust the ticker, whether you went long or short, and your entry and exit times. That would be really helpful!
good advice, thank you
Risk management ex. Diversification > diversification for trading. Diversification > risk management ex diversification. Thoughts?
Hey, congrats on the 1-year mark of being profitable! That‚Äôs awesome. I‚Äôm curious, when you first started, what kind of initial investment did you make? Were you playing it safe with a smaller amount or did you go in a bit heavier?

Also, since you're using algo trading, how do you manage your trade times? Do you let it run all day or focus on specific times when the market‚Äôs more active?

And out of curiosity, which market are you mainly in? Im from Asia so I am just curious.

Would love to hear more about how you‚Äôve been navigating all of this!
Can u go into more detail on number 6 please
What language is a good baseline for starting out?
Can you elaborate on how do you diversity and risk manage?

Do you invest in completely different instruments to diversify? Or within the same instrument class, but with some negative coefficients?

And risk management - hedging? Something more complex?

Reading more about these two, especially that you've listed them first, would be very interesting if you'd find a minute
What‚Äôs the average trade holding time?
Great post OP. Are you trading as an LLC or some other business/tax entity? Asking bc I‚Äôm nearing the point where I need to figure that out
How many different systems are you trading to be diversified? Or it's the same system on differnt markets?
Literally laughed at loud at this.
If you can afford it, you can keep $25K in your margin account to avoid PDTP. You can continue to trade only  with the amount you are using right now. You can bake that into your script.

I didn‚Äôt see any discussion about slippage. If you‚Äôre trading on 1min candles and place market orders, I assume there is crazy slippage. Do you track it? Do you place stop-limit orders instead of market orders? I‚Äôd love to hear more about how you manage it.
Great insights!
Do you import into TurboTax?
Excellent post! THANK YOU for this and CONGRATULATIONS!
Thanks for sharing and I wish you the best of luck. I've been profitable since June after starting out earlier in the year. I also use Alpaca as a broker and noticed that their short fees were really eating up any chance I had of profits and things turned around once I focused on avoiding shorting stocks directly. Also the coding bugs, was funny reading that part as I can relate to a simple mistake multiplying a loss many times over. I've got probably at least 20 sanity checks on my trades now. My account capital is probably %15 of my yearly income, but I would probably feel comfortable maybe at triple that now if I wanted. trades scale from a typical 2% to a pretty rare %10 based on market prediction for the day.
How many strategies r you using in your diversification? Or r u mainly diversifying across markets (crypto, stocks, futures, etc.)
How long do you paper trade before taking the script live?
I appreciate you sharing, and answering the various questions people have posted.
Given your coding background, do you think there's a way to take advantage of DLearning or RLearning (even MLearning)? Like price prediction or trading decisions (buy, sell, hold).
Good starting guide
Hey buddy, thanks for your post!

I concur with you. Forward test is incredibly important as a proof-of-concept, there's only so much backtesting we can do. Most of the time, if our forward results do not mirror our backtest, then something is wrong. I went through a dry spell of a few months building my algo and finally, it is delivering results on live/demo accounts on forward basis. However, I am cautious and see how each week goes. Not going to rush to monetise it, also seeking advice.

"Messy rambling, but hopefully some find it helpful."

I stopped reading when you sent me from 5 to 7.

Did not find it helpful, obviously.
TA paired with fundamental strategies. I don't use ML either and quite frankly I don't think I'm smart enough for that. I'm an inept coder at best and although I've given my best attempt at it I came out just more confused than before, and couldn't get it to work properly.   
Given the difference with a margin and cash account, I actually prefer a margin account. But technically yes you could, although I use alpaca which doesn't offer one. 

I use 10% of equity a trade with a 3% max stop loss,  it's dynamic and 3% is just the max. So .3% risk a trade.  
I don't set the stop losses, everything is run automatically.  I think trailing is objectively better than fixed.
>Couldn‚Äôt you bypass PDPT with a cash account? Or do you use margins?

What does PDPT stand for in this context?

Edit: I'm stupid. "Pattern Day Trading Protection" was mentioned earlier in that post.
RODC for volatility (I like it better than CE) and a high-length T3 for direction
Tradingview Webhook -> Raspberry Pi hosting a Python Script -> Alpaca  
I've been looking into cloud hosting, but haven't settled on a good option yet.
I screen them for volatility, then do a deep backtest on TradingView, I just look at what has best performed, not necessarily the right way to do it, as past results don't indicate future results, but it gives me an idea on its market structure.  I normally just change the RODC threshold value from around 30-55.
Yeah a lot of them kind of blend together. I could've arranged it better, and reduced it down to around 4 bigger points.
I run 10% equity a trade with a max SL of 3%. It comes out to 30% a year which I don't think is absurdly unrealistic unlike the 400% a year posts I've seen on here.
I had done web development previously (html, javascript, etc.)  for a short time, but not much. I did the absolute wrong thing and immediately tried coding a massive LSTM model with databases and everything and got overwhelmed. I tried tackling this again recently, but even with a couple years experience now I still couldn't wrap my head around it. Now I'm pretty good at PineScript and okay at Python.
I'll be honest I haven't read any books on the matter, countless hours of Youtube videos, articles, interviews and videos on high performers like John Neff, Warren Buffet etc. as well as your bog standard finance youtubers, however. Books cost money and I'm a stingy bitch.
It's something like daytradecount = api.get\_account()\['day\_trade\_count'\]  
If daytradecount >= 3  
return

Do a search for scripts on TradingView, then filter for strategies. Here's a good list of indicators as well.

hey check dm
Pattern Day Trading is when you have less than $25,000 in an account you are not allowed to perform more than 3 day trades a week, otherwise your account will be locked. A day trade is a trade opened and closed in the same day. When the law was implemented, they said it was to protect smaller traders, but really it just hurts them. I think it's actual purpose is to gatekeep smaller traders. Some sites I used in the past would let you open a trade if you hit the limit, but not close it.
Really up to you, I'm sure C elitists will come out of the woodworks to claim it's the only viable language. I chose python because of the amount of libraries, readability, and documentation.
I stick to stocks. Futures are very difficult TA-wise and I hate the fees on crypto. Also Alpaca doesn't allow shorting on crypto and can't trade futures either. I look for stuff with higher volatility, so AAPL is a no go. I try to avoid stuff where news can impact the price massively, like biotech etc. I use a dynamic trailing SL (max 3%) and only trade 10% equity.
Varies wildly between tickers, but anywhere from 120 minutes to 1.2 days depending.
Personal, probably should figure that out myself too.
I use a handful of systems, but different sectors. PYPL shouldn't affect the price of COIN, so I'd consider that diverse even though it's technically not in the traditional sense. When you start getting into higher numbers, liquidity becomes an issue, so rather than trading equity % I plan on doing a fixed # and dumping the excess profits into a managed funds or SPY or something.
Thanks!
I think you are under estimating the abilities of the traders in this sub.

I'm definitely the dumbest person here, I never even went to uni and learnt the math watching youtube videos. However, even I am using bayesian inference in my trading system. Bayesian on trade decisions (informative time frames) and as a model for dynamic position sizing.
Cool, thanks for the feedback!
Good thing there's no called strikes in reading reddit posts üòÅ
Thank you for that man, really interesting! So interestingly enough I‚Äôm currently in grad school for ML & AI, took a class on using ML for trading. Created a RL based trader, and although performed phenomenally on training data, it ultimately ended up overfitting, and didn‚Äôt work as great on real data.

I created a much simpler strategy, purely based on TA, and that one actually has decent returns on all my testing, in and out of sample. I was interested in deploying this one really.

Question:
1. Considering you use margin acct, do you just limit the no. Of trades you execute per week then? Or how do you get around PDPT

2. Really interesting that you use fundamental analysis too. Do you use it just to validate a trade and use TA to confirm? I have no experience with FA and have always been interested. I would love any light you can shed
For my own education, what is CE?
What is RDOC?
Google Cloud has an always free tier and AWS has a 12-month free tier. ¬†
If your python script is simple, you could do Tradingview Webhook -> Zapier or [make.com](http://make.com) -> Alpaca. That way everything runs in the cloud and you don't need to worry about servers etc.

Nice to see Raspberry Pi¬†get a mention on here!

30% per year is definitely more reasonable than those posts, but still incredible performance. I'm not saying you're wrong or lying, just a little skeptical. Have you measured the standard deviation of your returns? Have you backtested your strategy during different market regimes?
Thanks, mind sharing your Annual RoRs?
Interesting! Any "must-watch" bookmarks that you would feel one should watch (or read)?
Libraries though. You should look up Steven Kotlers write up on the ROI of reading books. It‚Äôs pretty insightful and might change your take on books.
Thanks! Do I read this correctly that you do max 3 trades a day? Isn't that limiting when you trade across however many tickers? I mean - for some strategies it's absolutely fine, I'm just asking if that's sufficient for the ones you're running across all your tickers.
Important note: Pattern day trading only applies to accounts capable of trading on margin. If you have a cash account you can make more than 3 trades per day. To be clear, this isn't theory. I have done it for 4 1/2 years.
I'm a bit of a C++ elitist, but IMO for retail trading, Python is the way to go unless you need low latency. It's too easy to shoot yourself in the foot with C++ even with a team of devs, and shooting yourself in the foot potentially means bleeding money.
Thanks for the answer üëç
To kind of elaborate a little further, COIN RIOT and MARA will perform similarly, so it's unadvisable to run the same strategy on all 3, as if all 3 react the same way, you could potentially be in 3 losing positions at once.
> When you start getting into higher numbers, liquidity becomes an issue

So obvious you are LARPing just based on this comment alone. You literally said in this thread that you have pattern day trading restrictions on your account haha
Doubt it, we invented the majority of the models back in the 90s. We trade to fund our new ventures and educate where needed as financial literacy has gone down the tube. I presume you also use limited order book (LOB) models to dissect the volume smashing at the door at opening of markets?
This post should be in r/daytrading or another degenerate sub. But given the downvotes, I suspect there is a lot of leakage from those subs into here.

One of the rare times when I am proud of downvotes.
Yes, Alpaca let's you access your day trade # so the script checks if I'm at 3 and if I am it just trashes the signal. It has been difficult watching my paper account go up much faster than my live account.   
I use fundamental for determining which tickers to use, TA for the trades themselves. A strategy has a shelf like of 6\~ months so you have to keep up on that. For example AAPL is such an involatile stock I don't run strategies on it.
ML4T, baby!

Thank you!!
The most max drawdown I'll allow is 8% (on an individual ticker) otherwise I find another ticker. I use Tradingview's deep backtesting tool so as far back as that allows. It trades on the 1 minute timeframe so I haven't been super concerned about the macro regime and I use a couple indicators to determine the current trend direction to determine trade direction and volatility for avoiding whipsaws. If the market isn't performing how I'd like it won't enter a trade and I constantly change out tickers.
30% this year, but I'm hoping to push it further this next. Replaced a couple indicators with newer ones that seem to be more reliable
I've picked up a lot of little things over time, but no one in particular stands out. There was a post on here a couple weeks ago that compiled the most important posts on this subreddit. That's a very good read
It's not enough :(, but hopefully I can get over the limit soon
PDTP is 3 day trades a *week* not a day :)
This is true, I'd also mention that your cash takes 2 days to settle on stocks, though options cash settles next day.
Yeah the issue with Cash accounts is that you have wait 2 days for the cash to settle. I get it skirts day trading, but a lot of the time the positions don't close in a day so I get to keep that trade. Preference I suppose
But not with the same money; only settled cash.¬†
I personally haven't run into latency issues, but I'm not running arbitrages or playing with a large amount of money, so it works fine for me.
did you keep reading?
Absolutely not I just watch number go up.

>*A strategy has a shelf like of 6\~ months*

This is something I don't understand. Is this some ICT/trader talking point or is there actual merit to this? 

Strategies certainlt don't work forever, but why the 6months? Especially if it's a unique method. I mean you've been profitable for 1yr and assuming you kept the same general approach, this breaks away from the narrative right? 

I understand markets get more efficient with time, we're implying trading is becoming less profitable with time/increase in # of profitable traders (which I can agree with but not the 6month thing tbh)
ML4T FTW baby!
Do you use the default parameters?
Any chance you have that saved to share?
Ah and there it is. I told OP that he could get T+0 with a cash account but i guess that is only with options as that is all i trade... that said, it did change to T+1 for all US securities earlier this year.
Have you ever tracked the settling time on a cash account? It's been a while, but I have and what I found was that all my trades were settling in T+0 (easily verifiable within the account) and that's when I realized T+2 is how much time they have to settle your trade NOT how much time it actually takes AND even that was reduced to T+1 earlier this year... Maybe it's broker dependent or there is some other variable involved that I am missing, BUT everyone should test out how long it actually takes to settle a trade via a cash account with their broker.
Do you have any idea how much is takes for liquidity to be a problem in arbitrage trades? Hint, it‚Äôs probably at least 1000x your entire portfolio‚Ä¶

By all means keep gambling but I would strongly suggest taking your profits and stop thinking you are a genius day trader‚Ä¶
Petty petty petty petty. Bravo. 

Would you have wanted to live the life of Isaac Newton?

Read through all of them. Good stuff. Big takeaway for me is to look into trailing orders instead of volatility-adjusted brackets.
Someone else pointed out that settlement is longer for stocks than options. I only trade options so you may only be able to get t+1... still probably worth checking to see how long it takes them to settle the cash.
I‚Äôm just trying to give you advice to stop before you blow up your portfolio.

I should also note, if you want to move up in industry, I think the online version is better from and opportunity cost perspective (while continuing FT employment). If your goal is a PhD or academia, then on campus is likely, in my view, the better option.
For me, it has been perfect. the cost and flexibility of schedule fits everything i needed. at my phase of life and in my career, in person would bot have been an option. Also, the cost being so low by comparison to in person has made it additionally attractive, because as of right now, i am a hobbyist in comp sci and software dev.

Backtest Results for a Simple Reversal Strategy
Hello, I'm testing another strategy - this time a reversal type of setup with minimal rules, making it easy to automate.

**Concept:**

Strategy concept is quite simple: If today‚Äôs candle has a lower low AND and lower high than yesterday‚Äôs candle, then it indicates market weakness. Doesn‚Äôt matter if the candle itself is red or green (more on this later). If the next day breaks above this candle, then it may indicate a short or long term reversal.

**Setup steps are:**

Step 1: After the market has closed, check if today‚Äôs candle had a lower low AND a lower high than yesterday.

https://preview.redd.it/ac0jhgrn1tmd1.png?width=770&format=png&auto=webp&s=1dff19fc34a77a1189f9888d1350de2f0dacc48b

Step 2: Place BUY order at the high waiting for a reversal

https://preview.redd.it/z1zgwfdo1tmd1.png?width=842&format=png&auto=webp&s=3397520ce8f9a0542c2b9f2fc6152ac123f554e9

Step 3: If the next day triggers the buy order, then hold until the end of the day and exit at (or as close as possible to) the day‚Äôs close.

https://preview.redd.it/f6gkunyo1tmd1.png?width=1041&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a93422ae7316808c4e80fdd9ac5c88da3fbe4be

**Analysis**

To test this theory I ran a backtest in python over 20 years of S&P500 data, from 2000 to 2020. I also tested a buy and hold strategy to give me a benchmark to compare with. This is the resulting equity chart:

https://preview.redd.it/ej5nbklp1tmd1.png?width=2082&format=png&auto=webp&s=6aef5fd2d49d96fe7c9704968999e58ca4967b9f

**Results**

Going by the equity chart, the strategy seemed to perform really well, not only did it outperform buy and hold, it was also quite steady and consistent, but it was when I looked in detail at the metrics that the strategy really stood out - see table below.

* The annualised return from this strategy was more than double that of buy and hold, but importantly, that was achieved with it only being in the market **15%** of the time! So the remaining 85% of the time, the money is free to be used on other strategies.
* If I adjust the return based on the time in market (return / exposure), the strategy comes out miles ahead of buy and hold.
* The drawdown is also much lower, so it protects the capital better and mentally is far easier to stomach.
* Win rate and R:R are also better for the strategy vs buy and hold.
* I wanted to pull together the key metrics (in my opinion), which are annual return, time in the market and drawdown, and I combined them into one metric called ‚ÄúRBE / Drawdown‚Äù. This gives me an overall ‚Äúscore‚Äù for the strategy that I can directly compare with buy and hold.

https://preview.redd.it/d3h157qq1tmd1.png?width=1683&format=png&auto=webp&s=20199c9b1b959ed11943984df3df14c7b2e8fa53

**Improvements**

This gave me a solid start point, so then I tested two variations:

Variation 1: ‚ÄúDown reversal‚Äù: Rules same as above, BUT the candle must be red. Reasoning for this is that it indicates even more significant market weakness.

Variation 2: ‚ÄúMomentum‚Äù: Instead of looking for a lower low and lower high, I check for a higher low and higher high. Then enter at the break of that high. The reasoning here is to check whether this can be traded as a momentum breakout

The chart below shows the result of the updated test.

https://preview.redd.it/uac02nkr1tmd1.png?width=2082&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca84df5268eded664125db9e4ee6ab3570bfe8c3

**Results**

At first glance, it looks like not much has changed. The reversal strategy is still the best and the two new variations are good, not great. But again, the equity chart doesn‚Äôt show the full picture. The table below shows the same set of metrics as before, but now it includes all 4 tested methods.

https://preview.redd.it/e3dqxy2s1tmd1.png?width=1864&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f1fe9dd5f06fac5e4cd0e76579f3766a9b36d74

Going by the equity chart, the ‚ÄúDown reversal‚Äù strategy barely outperformed buy and hold, but the metrics show why. It was only in the market 9% of the time. It also had the lowest drawdown out of all of the tested methods. This strategy generates the fewest trade signals, but the ones that it does generate tend to be higher quality and more profitable. And when looking at the blended metric of ‚Äúreturn by exposure/drawdown‚Äù, this strategy outperforms the rest.

EDIT: Added "out of sample testing" section below on 04/09:

**Out of Sample Testing**

All of the results in the sections above were done on the "in-sample" data from 2000 to 2020. I then ran the test from 2020 to today to show the results of the "out-of-sample" test. Equity chart below

https://preview.redd.it/m9m7hls3aumd1.png?width=1387&format=png&auto=webp&s=c41f594fd35aca945c3180a7ee91fe1ed1d108bb

The equity chart only shows half the picture though, the metrics below show that the system performance has held on well, especially the drawdown, which has been minimal considering the market shocks over the last 4 years:

https://preview.redd.it/rlao1yibaumd1.png?width=857&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc066c8a925a437ee3f551e789aa4c0628bdaa5f

**Overfitting**

When testing on historic data, it is easy to introduce biases and fit the strategy to the data. These are some steps I took to limit this:

* I kept the strategy rules very simple and minimal.
* I also limited my data set up until 2020. This left me with 4.5 years worth of out of sample data. I ran my backtest on this out of sample dataset and got very similar results with ‚Äúreversal‚Äù and ‚Äúdown reversal‚Äù continuing to outperform buy and hold when adjusted for the time in the market.
* I tested the strategy on other indices to get a broader range of markets. The results were similar. Some better, some worse, but the general performance held up.

**Caveats:**

The results look really good to me, but there are some things that I did not account for in the backtest:

1. The test was done on the S&P 500 index, which can‚Äôt be traded directly. There are many ways to trade it (ETF, Futures, CFD, etc.) each with their own pros/cons, therefore I did the test on the underlying index.
2. Trading fees - these will vary depending on how the trader chooses to trade the S&P500 index (as mentioned in point 1). So i didn‚Äôt model these and it‚Äôs up to each trader to account for their own expected fees.
3. Tax implications - These vary from country to country. Not considered in the backtest.
4. Dividend payments from S&P500. Not considered in the backtest.
5. And of course - historic results don‚Äôt guarantee future returns :)

**Code**

The code for this backtest can be found on my github: [https://github.com/russs123/reversal\_strategy](https://github.com/russs123/reversal_strategy)

**More info**

This post is even longer than my previous backtest posts, so for a more detailed explanation I have linked a vide below. In that video I explain the setup steps, show a few examples of trades, and explain my code. So if you want to find out more or learn how to tweak the parameters of the system to test other indices and other markets, then take a look at the video here:

What do you all think about these results? Does anyone have experience trading a similar reversal strategy?

Looking forward to some constructive discussions :)
Nice research and presentation! I wonder what it would look like with some position sizing!
Man i wanted this to work... sadly no dice.
Barely moved over 20 years.


Here is a link to the [interactive backtest](https://www.quantconnect.com/terminal/processCache?request=embedded_backtest_596a79f402447849fe5142b7e88f25ed.html) (with code), and a link to the [detailed report](https://www.quantconnect.com/reports/596a79f402447849fe5142b7e88f25ed).

Implementation details:

* Two minutes after open, i compare yesterday's candle to the previous day's. If conditions are favorable, I trade the break of yesterdays high.
* Rather than use a buy stop, i am manually checking every minute to see if price foes above the previous high
* I hold till the morning, and exit at the first minute after open (i tried exiting at the close of the same day but it was even worse.

  
Sharing code here as well, in case you folks may see something I'm missing. 

```python
    from AlgorithmImports import *
    
    class SPYBreakoutStrategy(QCAlgorithm):

Love your posts keep them coming :)
You are basically testing ‚ÄúThe Strat by Rob Smith‚Äù
Great read and really nice presentation. I have yet to look at the code but I am interested in how this would perform with a shorter (or longer) time frame. It might be interesting to combine multiple time frames to help with risk management. For example: instead of holding till EOD based on an entry, hold until there is a break in momentum or an opposite reversal on a shorter time frame. I could see this helping with the drawdown, although it could result in missing out on potential gains. Keep it pushing
For the 1st variation, you're using current bars high as a trigger on the end-of-day data. If I read your script correctly you are downloading the tickers from yfinance and without specific mention of IEOD, it downloads daily data since you used start and end date in date format and not in datetime format. And with IEOD it only fetches 3 months data.

How are you backtesting it with EOD data? With this, It will take the current day's high as a trigger when it crosses above the previous day's high, but then you want to close the position on the same day. It need IEOD data to backtest.   
For EOD data you have to write

""    
(data.high.shift(1) < data.high.shift(2)) and (data.low.shift(1) < data.low.shift(2))

""

then

""

 high > high.shift(1)

""

- that will satisfy your trigger and you will get entry on the next bar's open and then you can close on the day close not on day high, because trading live you never know when HOD gonna end up.
New algo trader, so my opinion matters much less, but it seems like the down reversal is a good start, and obv returns more consistent profitability, so perhaps it could be used as a boiler plate strategy, whilst refining the actual conditions for the "more significant market weakness". I was actually looking at testing a very similar strategy, so this is insightful, thank you.
Awesome read, like last time, but again I see that it has been underperforming buy-n-hold in the last few years. Which could be a sign that algorithms, against which this is competing, have become better. Or it could be a sign that this strategy is simply broken? Not saying this is so, but just want to understand it.
Love concrete research and presentations like this. Keep it coming!
I ran your code on a bunch of different symbols. I couldn't replicate any results as good as \^GSPC or \^SPX. Note that when you use \^GSPC it uses adjusted data. This may not be ideal as we are doing intra-day trading in this strategy.

As I've pointed out in similar threads, all you've discovered is that equities indices go up more than they go down.

There are any number of long-only strategies that can work with these markets, and many will be much more profitable (with less drawdown) than this one.
This is pretty cool, thanks for sharing. Might test this myself, I was also about to try a similar strategy to overcome basic timing of buy and hold or trying to time the market.

Did you buy this historical daily data from a reliable vendor? I have kinetick data feed and 10 years of data but I know for sure they are accurate, just curious because im looking into data feeds for minute data etc. which I don‚Äôt have past 2 years
Very nice job!  I wonder if you could identify points in time where one of your three strategies would be a better choice for that day/week/time period based on some other broader trends?  e.g. closing price above/below 10, 30, 60, 100, etc. day moving averages.

I also agree with others on choosing something tradeable, like SPY, QQQ, etc.  I assume I can test those on my own by replacing the symbol in your code.  Will give it a try.

So, in practice, would you get signals at the end of each trading day (for action the next day)?  Does yfinance provide data fast enough to run that in the evenings after close?  Have you already created the code to spit out signals for current data based on your parameters of the backtests?

Edit:  Yep, unfortunately, it looks like Buy & Hold is the best strategy when testing SPY and QQQ.
I was unable to repeat your results with a backtest in WealthLab. There may be an error in your code
Very interesting results and a lot of nice work here. Couple quick questions:

1. It would be very interesting to pull the historical E-mini futures and run the statistics there. I think part of the lack of response to these simple approaches is as you mentioned the difficulty of trading the index. Time to equilibration in a more liquid derivative I think *may* diminish these results a good bit (not to be a downer).

2. Is all of the data on returns here presented from the 4.5 years of oot/oos data?
It will work while in a bull run. You may want to run it and just keep an eye on when markets become bearish.

Otherwise, if you want a bulletproof strategy, you should backtest it doing only shorts and see how it performs.

But it is also true that s&p500 in the long run it can only go up.

One thing I didn't understand is at which point do you set the order? How do you know that there is a wick long enough that doesn't open the buy with current volatility?
where can I get 20y of SP500 data?
Well written post. Inspiring stuff
Great job. The strat really is timing the bottom and then selling at the top. What I don‚Äôt fully understand is the take profit point; that is, are you closing same day or swinging there trade just like you showed on the chart? If the take profit is purely same day then I‚Äôm more curious how the strat outperforms simple buy and hold. However, if the trade is allowed more time, that is swinging the trade, then I am curious when you know to take profit while swinging. This is not completely clear to me. Great job tho
Do you mind if I ask: Are you using any platforms or software for these automated trading strats / backtests? Or are you simply using Python on your local machine? Where are yiu getting your historical prices? Thank you in advance for the insight! You've earned a new YT subscriber. Looking forward to more content!
Looking at your out-of-sample data. Looks like the reversal does really well when the market is flat or doing exceptionally poorly. But it seems to struggle when the market is on a strong bull run. Looking at your basic strategy of following only a few simple rules, do you think there are another set of rules that would not alter the performance during crashes but also allow the reversal to perform well during a bull run?
Great and professional testing! Only thing I don't understand: your Buy&Hold shows a quite different %% than the market research shows: "Based on historical data, the annualized return of the S&P 500 from 2000 to 2020 was approximately 5.9% " versus your Buy&Hold of 4.07% Now that might look minor because it's about the B&H, but it makes me wonder what is different in the calculation method of how you calculate your results (because it might effect your strategy results also). If the explanation is in the not calculating for the dividends, that is something you need to make an assumption for in the B&H then, because it's a very substantial amount especially over such long time frame and especially with the re-investment of the dividends in buying more of the stock.

Another point: your tested time interval includes two of the three major economic crisis in the last 100 years ((2007/8 and COVID), plus the dot-com bubble pop. It might be interesting to see how your different strategies performed over these crisis years and outside these years. Only looking at such a long time frame, doesn't tell you all about the differencs in"weather resistance" of your strategies.

But again, good work!
Why do you think it works? And have you tested it on a different index/ETF?
Simple strategy yet nicely presented!
Very cool
Bloody hell! This is what i want to see. I need to follow this sub (and maybe you in particular)
[deleted]
I am a beginner and your research is very helpful. Thank you!
I think trading fees have a really large impact on this sort of strategy and if your strategy will probably become unprofitable after you incorporate them.
Cool! What‚Äôs the SL?
what platform was used to backtest?
Is it really only 10% maximum drawdown? Is open trade considered too ?
Looking through your code. Did you set up your entry price to mimic an overnight limit order?
[deleted]
Awesome post OP, if I may just add one more interesting input is that we can also check the timing of these trades: for example generally speaking September is not the best time to be long, I know it is an over simplification but it's just an example pls bear with me, so I'm curious to see would the results be better if some more rules regarding timing are included (September, Friday, 13th, just to name a few). Keep up the good work!
This looks very similar to one of Ali Casey's recent videos. You might find some additional ideas there. 

https://youtu.be/ZS6yo7cwtGk
Hey, where‚Äôd you get the data from and how do we know it‚Äôs reliable? Love this work
Great research. Is it fair to say that if I had implemented this algorithm in 2020 based on the backtest from 2000-2019, I would have lost (portfolio value) against the B&H strategy by now? Probably even more including trading costs?
Nice work. I haven‚Äôt read the other comments yet but what did you use for a stop loss, if any? Or did you exit at the end of the next day regardless?
Great research, kudos!

In the future could you add the number of trades and expected profit per trade for each strategy to your backtest results? That would help us understand their effectiveness better.
Here's results over Jan2016 - Jan2024 on Daily: [https://imgur.com/a/AWVwuoB](https://imgur.com/a/AWVwuoB)  
\^Disregard that it was 30min.
You gotta look at the sortino and expectancy of the trades.  They are much more straitforward metrics and easy to interpret, and people use them a lot, so it's an easy comparison for the community. They are basically different forms of avg profit per dollar risked on each trade.

My guess is fees & slippage are going to have a huge effect here. Only based on my own experience playing with a similar idea

This is just a personal problem, but I would pull my hair out placing only 1 trade a month for 20 years, but that might be something you're good with. Just pointing it out. 

Clever idea. Seems like there's potential here if you had an ensemble of strategies you wanted to include it with.
So, I saved this post quite a while back and finally got a chance to test it in Indian markets. Specially ^NSEI NIFTY 50 index 

I was really surprised that the results are quite a polar opposite. The buy and hold was the only thing that was profitable, I wonder why this is the reason ü§î

I understand no strategy is good for all markets, but why such a stark difference, I am pretty sure it's not Because of overfitting, as the strategy itself is very fundamental and does not use complex indicators
Great job. Looking forward if you test it in E-Mini to solve the issue of not being able to trade the index.
Very interesting - how did you learn coding? Chat GPT produced a code based on my questions from a profitable strategy but i have no idea how to translate that into my charts!
[deleted]
Ok got it, buying puts on QQQ
Thanks! There's definitely scope to expand the backtest to cover position sizing. I also haven't looked at different hold periods and exit on the same day as the trade opens. So with more time I can make the backtest more detailed.
For those that are wondering, it doesn't work with SPY: [https://i.imgur.com/uKek7bi.png](https://i.imgur.com/uKek7bi.png)
This looks like it's making a lot more trades than OP's testing. You're running the check at the day's open -- is it possible you're comparing today's 2-minute old data to yesterday's data (rather than yesterday's to two days ago)?

And this could be easier to loop through and tally, rather than simulate (I say this not having done anything about it). For each sequence of 3 days (where day\[2\] would represent "today")...  
`if day[0].max>day[1].max and day[0].min>day[1].min and day[2].max>day[1].max:`  
`gainz += day[2].close - day[1].max`

This would obviously be optimal conditions., but it should pretty quickly provide either a proof or rejection of the concept.
So I did a simplified formula for this in a spreadsheet. This does **not** compound or take dividends or slippage into account. Removing compounding de-emphasizes the specific dates used to test the strategy.  
Again, this is simplified to test the signal/strategy. If your money is only in the market for a total of 3000 hours over 25 years, you can find something else to do with it for the other 216000 hours.

This trades SPY and runs from 1/3/2000 - 9/4/2024, which I think are the dates you used.

Column Explanations:  
STRATEGY GAIN: This is based on the "Reversal" strategy described by OP. BUY at yesterday's high and sell at close if the signal is given and it reaches yesterday's high at some point that day. This buys $10,000 worth of shares each time.  
DAILY (HOLD): Every day, this buys $10,000 worth of shares at yesterday's close and sells them at today's close. It is effectively a daily, non-compounding measure of SPY gain/loss. It's in the market 100% of the time.  
SPY NO SIGNAL: If there is no initial signal from the "Reversal" strategy, buys $10,000 worth of shares at yesterday's close and sells them at today's close. This is like a practicable inverse of the strategy.  
SPY NO BUY: If the "Reversal" strategy does *not buy*, buys $10,000 worth of shares at yesterday's close and sells them at today's close. This is a non-practicable inverse of the strategy, because it incorporates foreknowledge of the high. These last two columns are here to reinforce that the trades made by the Reversal strategy tend to be better than those *not* made by the strategy.

|SPY|STRATEGY GAIN|DAILY (HOLD)|SPY NO SIGNAL|SPY NO BUY|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Average Change|0.201%|0.036%|0.004%|-0.107%|
|Number of BUYs|1016|6207|4022|5191|
|Winning trades|619|3373|2175|2565|
|Losing trades|390|2814|1833|2608|
|Win %|60.93%|54.34%|54.08%|49.41%|

As I mentioned in an earlier comment, this is a proof of concept under ideal conditions. I think it's an intriguing result.
Thank you :)
Ah cool, thanks. I'll read up on the details of it. Have you traded this strategy previously?
When was rob smith trading this strat?
Thank you! Good suggestions, there's definitely room for improvement in the backtest. It gets more challenging when dropping below daily candles because free historic data isn't as readily available for that. If I can get a decent source of hourly data, then I'd be curious to test the strategy on that and see how it performs.
60-minute test with no changes looks like this:  
[https://imgur.com/hxqzk6H](https://imgur.com/hxqzk6H)

Setting it to trade only during market open makes it slightly less terrible, but still very negative.
Yep exactly this is the correct strategy code. OP's code is incorrect and has lookahead bias because the trigger uses today's high/low compared to yesterday's high/low (data.high < data.high.shift(1)) instead of yesterday and the day before yesterday's high (data.high.shift(1) < data.high.shift(2)).

This is a glaring mistake as you can never use today's high and low to determine today's entry or exit since you don't know what today's high or close is until today has finished. The candle is fully known once the day has ended so the only price you are allowed to trade at for backtests is today's open and close. For signals, you can only use today's open and any data before.
It can be with EOD data because all that really matters here is the OHLC price points. I have my entry based on yesterday's high. So if today's high is above that value then it means at some point during the day, the entry was hit. It doesn't matter when that happened, that's why intra day isn't needed.
Thanks! Yea I think it can be refined quite a bit. I was weary of doing too much refining at this stage and making it too overfitted but there are probably some simple rules that can be tested to see if they help improve it
Thank you! It's a good point, so for this strategy I did actually do an in-sample and out-of-sample test. The initial test was to 2020, but I have also ran a test from 2020 to today and the results are still decent. The equity curve doesn't look particularly impressive but when you look at all the metrics together, the out of sample test holds up really well. 

I have edited my main post with out of sample data, take a look :)
Thank you! Hopefully more to come as long as I can find more strategies that give decent results
Was just wondering how this strategy works with other indexes... thanks for sharing your research!

Now I thinking how this would work if we monitor all indexes. For example whenever one of the index triggers the signal we open a position. That would radically increase no of trades, improve capital utilization and diversify.
Ah damn, some of those results are really bad, although some are probably not as bad as they first look because the equity chart doesn‚Äôt consider the risk adjusted returns and time in market.

I‚Äôm not sure about the adjusted data, what do you mean by that? Are you referring to the adjusted close?

I know yahoo finance data gives the close as well as the adjusted close. But I always use the unadjusted close because the open,high and low are unadjusted. So if you mix the adjusted close with unadjusted data then it screws up the calculations. 
Did you use a different data source that had adjusted values for all columns?
I'll need to add that as a caveat to my next post :P . My point is that it beats buy and hold and that's my own personal aim. 

Do you have some recommendations for the other strategies you mention? Would be curious to test them out
Great, can you share a few?
Thanks! That's also my goal, if I can find something that beats buy and hold then that would be great.

For my data I am using yahoo finance. It's free and as far as I know it is fairly accurate for bigger indices like S&P 500. The limitation is that for long time periods you can only get daily data. I'm quite happy trading on a daily time period though, it would fit around my job etc as I wouldn't be able to sit and watch charts during the day.

I haven't heard of kinetick, did you have to pay for that data?
It's not the code; just doesn't work with individual stocks or tradeable securities.  Results are not the same for SPY or QQQ either.  Buy & Hold performs the best with those.
I don't have too much experience with E-mini futures (i.e. none) so didn't want to test it in case there's some underlying features of it that you need to be aware of. You may well be right though that when used on something that can actually be traded, the results are not as good.

The data above is all on the 20 years of in sample data. I didn't include the out of sample stuff as the post was just getting too long! But with minimal python knowledge, my code can be tweaked to test any time period that data is available for.
It did seem to hold out quite well during the bearish periods like in 2008, when it continued to show good results. But backtest isn't the same as live trading so still need to see how it holds up.

The entry order would be the high of the previous day after that day has closed, so you wouldn't trigger the trade until the next day. So if the next day hits the previous day, then I would enter. It may be that it just touches it and then goes back down and closes for a loss, but those are also counted in the backtest.
I get historic data from yahoo finance and if you are happy working with daily data then you can go back much more than 20 years. But if you need more granular data like hourly periods then you're more limited unless you pay for it. I've never bought data though, just stuck with daily data from yahoo
Thanks!
Thank you. Yes in this backtest the strat takes profit on the same day at the close. I think the reason it outperforms buy and hold with that is simply the trade selection. Waiting for the previous day's high to be broken seems to result in a higher likelihood of a profitable trade. It also means on days when the market just continues going down all day, the strat sits on the sidelines hence the lower drawdowns.

I think potentially using these setups to enter and then hold for a few days or setting exits based on some kind of R:R could be quite profitable, at least from the trades I looked at on the chart. I just didn't get round to testing the various take profit methods. It would open up more downside risk though and potentially higher drawdown if it ends up holding onto a losing trade for longer. So some kind of stop loss may be needed to cut losses quickly.

The backtest I presented is the v1.0 that can then be built out with different variations to see what works and what doesn't.
Hi, just replied to your comment on the YT video then saw this comment :) so i'll paste the response:

Yes I just use python on my local machine together with jupyter notebook so I can lay it out logically.

The historic prices all come from yahoo finance and are downloaded within the python script with a 3rd party library. The limitation is that if you want long term data, you are limited to daily data at best. But for my backtests this works just fine.

If I was to try testing these on faster time frames like hourly for example then I'd probably need to look into paying for historic data.
That's always the challenge, getting a strategy to work well in all market conditions. It's possible that the exit conditions in this strategy are what is limiting the upside and why it doesn't perform as well in a bull run as buy and hold. Since I exit at the end of the daily candle, I can miss out on a nice upward run.

So an interesting change to the strategy could be to hold onto trades for a defined number of days instead of exiting on the same day. Or perhaps using an exit signal (like a reversal in the opposite direction) to get back out. The danger here is that it also increases the risk because you could hold a losing trade for longer.

There's definitely some improvements that could be made to the strategy, so what I've presented here can be taken and built out further.
Thank you. Two very good points. Yes you're quite right about the dividends. It was a bit of an afterthought so I didn't include it in the test but for comparison purposes I should have accounted for them. Something I'll look to include in future backtests.

Also an interesting point about splitting out the crisis and non crisis periods. I'm developing my "metrics" function with each backtest, so I've calculated a lot more info on the strategies on this backtest compared to my previous backtests. It should be possible to "group" the data into individual years or sets of multi-year periods and compare the performance across the different groups.

Appreciate the suggestions, gives me some things to think about :)
it doesn't work on etfs. not sure why it only works on spx index
Thanks!
Thanks!
Haha thanks! I'm still just testing things to see what sticks. This one looks promising though.
No problem! Each day the setup resets. So if the trade doesn‚Äôt get triggered today then the system moves onto the next day and does its checks again. So in the scenario you described, there would be no trade as the high wasn‚Äôt triggered. There would also not be a new setup the next day because it didn‚Äôt make a lower low. So the previous trade setup is forgotten about entirely.
No probs! I‚Äôm also a beginner, haven‚Äôt actually traded any of these strategies yet, so take my results with a pinch of salt üòÖ. But hopefully soon I‚Äôll test them live, just want to get a few strategies put together first and then deploy them together
True, but trading fees vary massively depending on broker and trading instrument (CFD, ETF, futures, etc).

Also the amount of capital will have an impact since the trading fee is often fixed, so the bigger the capital, the smaller impact a trading fee has.

That's why I don't model trading fees in these backtests, it's up to each trader to do their own modelling based on their own personal circuimstance.
No SL, you just hold the trade until the end of the day. It could be tested with a stop loss though to see what impact it has. But for this back test I didn‚Äôt use an SL
OP used a custom python script that they linked in the post
I prefer coding my own backtests so I have full visibility of what it's doing. I wrote the backtest in python.
Yes that‚Äôs right
Thanks for the link, I just watched it now and it‚Äôs interesting how similar the concept is! It‚Äôs probably quite a common strategy and the results he showed are quite impressive. The win rate was very high but at the risk of a big loss. 
The fundamental concept of the method is what matters though. The stop loss/take profit can be done in many different ways
Hello. I get the data from yahoo finance. I can‚Äôt vouch for its reliability but as far as free data sources go it‚Äôs probably the most used one.
Thanks! 
Yes in terms of portfolio value, buy and hold outperformed since 2020, but at the same time there was a 34% drawdown to endure.
So it depends on how the strategies are compared. Looking at the risk adjusted return as well as the return adjusted for time in the market, the strategy beat buy and hold.
It comes down to personal risk tolerance. For example you could trade the strategy with leverage, increasing the reward so it outperforms buy and hold but also increasing the risk.
Thanks. Yea I exit at the end of the day but that was more for simplicity. Quite a few trades look like they could turn into runners so the stop loss and take profit can be improved I‚Äôm sure.
Thanks! Good point, I have that data but only included it in the screenshot for the out of sample test. You can see the number of trades, avg win/loss etc in that screenshot but it only covers 2020 to today.
Thanks! Will take a look at sortino for future backtests
Asset choice is a highly overlooked form of overfitting.
I accounted for the gap in the backtest, so if the price gaps above the high then the entry is automatically adjusted to the new day's open. That filters out the inflated results from impossible entries to an extent. You are right about not being able to get the exact open and close price, but over time those should even out since sometimes you will get a price above the close and sometimes below.
Neat strategy. How about adding all 3 strategies into one?
Thanks for sharing. Please share additional metrics for a more helpful comparison: drawdown, starting balance, ending balance, Sharpe.
Why did you did 'out of sample' testing? I don't see how this is helpful outside of machine learning.
Always has been, died few months ago
How are you assuming that you will get a fill at yesterday's high? 

I tried mentioning to you in another thread, this is literally the definition of lookahead bias.

You take information from the future and apply a trade in the past. If anything you should be modeling a fill at the open price.

I understood what you were saying in all these comments. I agree with what you are saying 'You will know that signal was triggered at some point "yesterday" and you are ready to buy reversal at crossover "today" ' and it's fine if the process is manual or data is IEOD.

But you backtested it with EOD data which simulates the process automatically, so how algo will know when it has only a day's OHLC data? Algo will only know that it crossed the trigger when the current bar's high or close crosses above. That would have also worked but in your code, you didn't shift the max lookback period 2 days back to satisfy lower low, lower high i.e. df.shift(2), instead, the lookback period is just one i.e. shift(1), so your system when executing the entry it is using lookahead information. This is what everyone is saying.
Yeah you can't just assume you'll get a fill at yesterday's high. This is especially the case if you're allowing for "green" second candles. Any time the market gaps up relative to the previous close (i.e. it opens 0.1% higher or 1% higher), you magically give yourself a fill at the previous close price. This is where all your edge is.
What were you thinking of?
Thanks!
good idea, but it only seems to work on spx
I mispoke before. I SPX or \^GSPC is unadjusted on yfinance. However it's confusing because it gives you an 'adjusted close' column. This however, is unadjusted by the nature of the index.

the backtests are on both unadjusted and adjusted versions. i figured i'd include both because my mind was a little fuzzy at the time. The yfinance ones are all unadjusted and should be correct. The alpaca are adjusted (where stated) and are likely erroneous. so ignore those.

Sorry for the mixup. I'll edit my post above for clarity.
I‚Äôm very new here but one factor I try to consider in my algo‚Äôs is volume. There‚Äôs a reason we have a VWAP indicator: prices are more/less meaningful depending on how many people are transacting. I‚Äôd love to see you include that in one of your theories. For example, price increase on high volume is a great sign more gains are coming.
!RemindMe 1 day
Yeah that makes sense I also don‚Äôt like staring at charts hence the automation, I did indeed pay for my data. Kinetick data feed is well known to be used with NinjaTrader, which is what I use. I get the live data of most futures and stocks from them so I can run my automated C# strategies all in ninja trader which is convenient (I only have 2 main strategies right now on ES/NQ).

I pay around $70 a month right now, and I get 2 years of minute data + 10 years of bar data in addition to the live data feeds. I found my backtests to be drastically different once I started using them (more accurate)
Hmm really would be interesting to include the out of apple data, as this is really what matters (even if instead of the current data).

The only real idiosyncracy of the futures is dealing with the roll which is easy.
Ah ok clear, backtest it with mt5, it's a quite simple code, and then you could also forward test it on demo for like 1 month woth mt5, then put a small amount like 1k USD, and double it on every green month. Until you reach the maximum amount you want to risk. 

If you cap, let's say 5% drawdown a day by sizing lower and max 10% drawdown, you could go with a prop firm, at the end you risk 1.4k usd for a 200k usd.

Actually, DM me I can do it in mt5 and let you know the results.
I am still unclear as to whether you are only testing on the current s&p500 constituents‚Ä¶
Welcome. Always happy to make good research maybe even a tiny bit better. One more point: adjusting the results for the percentage of time used of the capital, is just not realistic in real life: If you (or the investor) wants to use the money in the mean time, then good options need to be available for that; then the alternatives need to get sold immediately, regardless of their results at the moment you need the capital afain; possible negative results diminish the capital available etc. Maybe better forget about that and focus more on your main strategy. I think with expanding the rule (so not more rules) to e.g. the total move should be at least x% of the price before entering, you avoid a lot of whip saws that many strategies suffer from results wise.
Hmm interesting. Even not SPY?
I haven't found a good strategy that when tested over many years and different stocks, actually produces a reliable profit. You are giving me hope üôÇüëç
[deleted]
It is true that fees vary, but I don't think ignoring fees is the best way to deal with this. In my opinion, it would have been better to find a range of reasonable transaction cost values then have a graph showing multiple equity curves at different fixed transaction cost values.
Right. This was just a proof of concept for finding a fairly robust entry/exit without the use of indicators, which helps avoid overfit. Better SL/TP management and perhaps a market regime filter could help.

I might suggest testing a stronger mean reversion exit. Just exiting in profit is a consistent exit, but a weak one. Maybe try exiting when the Close is higher than the previous day's High.

I do a lot of mean reversion strategies, and that is usually one of the strongest options, especially when paired with a good stop loss strategy (counting max hold days in that).
That is very true. Also interesting to note is that in the years 2020-2021, B&H significantly outperformed after its dramatic fall, did poorly in 2022 and then again very well in 2023-2024. Would be nice to know that in advance :-) so it doesn't look like rolling the dice.
You should test it. I probably will. And I would test options on SPX because they can be setup to have a tailored risk/reward.

I‚Äôll have to go back and look at your post, but was there a win rate? If it‚Äôs above about 55% there are ways to trade it as a binary outcome where the P&L doesn‚Äôt depend on the size of the move, just which direction it takes by end of day.
Okay, so I see the win rates were between 57% and 67%. That‚Äôs awesome. The problem then is the entry and whether it can happen a finite amount of time after the open on gap days. Assuming you‚Äôll get the exact open price is a problem. Especially with options.
Well said, but do strategies that work on all asset classes even exist? I am not considering arbitrage and other market inaccuracies
[deleted]
I'll work on getting those formulas in the spreadsheet, but I don't have anything for those metrics as it is. I'm just wondering about the mismatch in our counts. I notice you have fees calculated, although I'm not sure why. And did yours complete more trades? Why is that?
It‚Äôs to help prevent curve fitting the strategy. You keep some data aside as a second test. If your strategy works on the main test data but then falls apart on the out of sample data then it could mean you‚Äôve just tailored the strategy to that specific period 
If it works on out of sample data then it gives some extra verification
yeah i don't see any need for this cause there's no parameters to fit "in sample"
Wait... Rob died, or the strat died?
Let me explain. The high from yesterday is the target entry. So today you know what yesterday's high is. If today's price increases and hits that high, then you buy, otherwise you skip the trade. There's no lookahead bias there.

I've also filtered gaps. So if today gaps up above yesterday's high, then the entry price is taken as today's open.
Typically not even possible to get filled at open price. Slippages are there
I have that covered in my code.

The trade entry price is calculated with an if/else type of formula:

"np.where(price.Open > price.High.shift(1), price.Open, price.High.shift(1))"

This is saying that if today's open is above yesterday's high, i.e. there's a gap, then the entry price is updated to today's open, not yesterday's high.
Nothing specific but possibly something simple like a moving average to get the direction of the trend or look for trade signals that occur close to the ma, sort of like a pullback. Haven‚Äôt tested these ideas though so can‚Äôt say if they make a difference
Interesting, I haven't really considered any strategies based around volume. I've got a long list of ideas that I want to test out, all based around some kind of price pattern or statistical outlier. Will add volume and VWAP to my notes to look into at some stage too.

Thanks for the suggestion.
You're right, that's an important part of the overall picture so I've ran the backtest for 2020 to today's date and updated my main post above to show the results. The equity chart doesn't look particularly impressive but when you look deeper at the various metrics, it holds up well and is similar to the in-sample results from 2000 to 2020
Are you thinking about survivorship bias? i.e. the composition of the s&p has changed over time as companies come and go.

That thankfully isn't an issue when testing the entire index since the price is a reflection of the composition at that time, but it would be an issue if you were backtesting the individual companies that make up the s&p as you would need to account for those companies that were added/dropped over the years.
Good question, I never actually filtered that in my testing so the first candle doesn‚Äôt matter. 
But that would be an interesting filter to add and see what happens to the results
Yea that‚Äôs one of the limitations with this one because the assumption of getting a fill on the open is probably not accurate. But I would need better resolution data to check that properly. 
I‚Äôm not home just now but I could filter out the gap days later and see what different it makes because if the strat holds up without the gap days then it may still be worthwhile.
Besides what you mentioned you're not considering (But not sure why) no (probably!) not. But strategies/ideas based on a broad behavior should work on similar assets, for example as you believed for the NIFTY 50. If they don't and only work in a single case it's likely you've just stumbled upon that 1 in a million pattern that has currently lead the asset but that could change at any moment. Nothing wrong with trading that, but should always be aware of the fact.
That's where futures come in handy. The leverage allows you to run multiple strategies in unison with less capital requirements.
perhaps he didn't include SPY results because it doesn't work:

Thanks. I never understood out of sample data either.
Rob
I think there's still a bit of an issue here with replication in live trading. Because you're essentially buying on a break of yesterday's high you need to use a buy stop order rather than a limit order. A buy stop order won't enter the market until the high is hit. Now in terms of the OPEN price, you do not know what the OPEN is until after the fact, and because it's a buy stop order entry you will not have a live order in the order book until after the OPEN. You really need tick data or 1 minute data to backtest this idea. Attempting to enter at yesterday's HIGH price also has the same issue. I would bet money on your live trading results significantly underperforming backtest results, live trading might even possibly be breakeven or loss making. It's hard to hear after putting in so much work but I've been down this road myself before and now exclusively backtest using tick data only.
[deleted]
Oh awesome I'll check it out once I get home. 

One other confusion I was having though. Your plots show the returns all throughout the timeline. If your back tested strategy is deterministic and only in the market 9-25% of the time, the plots don't quite make sense to me. Your returns should be horizontal for a lot of the plot, shouldn't they? Unless I'm misinterpreting how you're defining time in market.
I see, I thought you were testing on the constituents. Thanks for clarifying.
Or you only get in on pullbacks from the gap. Tons of possibilities that might work.

Edit: I mean pullbacks into the gap.
[deleted]
Ah, maybe a buy stop is what I meant and mixed up my terminology. But you understand the intention. Once I have a high from yesterday's "signal candle", then that's where I want to enter.

If it gaps up above, then it does become trickier and assuming a fill at the open is always possible may be optimistic. The gap days made up a decent % of the overall trades but I wouldn't discount them entirely. It may be that a fill at the open doesn't happen, but you get in a few points above instead. It would eat into profitability but I'd need to tweak the backtest to see the impact.
By the end of today‚Äôs candle you will know what the open,high,low and close were. So if the high went above the entry price then that means the trade triggered at some point during the day.
That is true. The strategy looks simple and promising enough for me to backtest it on ES data when I have the time. I imagine results should be relatively similar.
I'm new to this, just trying to understand. But if your back test determines whether or not you bought during that day based on what the close price is, then is there a scenario where your buy was triggered at the daily high and then the price fell before close (and you lost money) even though the close price might be higher than yesterday?
[deleted]
If I have a candle with a lower low and lower high, then lets call that the "signal candle". The high of that signal candle becomes my target entry point.

The day after the signal candle is where my entry happens, so I am waiting for today's price to go above the **high** of yesterday's signal candle.

From that, there are then two separate things happening in the backtest:

1. I check if today's high at any point went above yesterday's high. If it did, then it means that the entry must have been triggered at some point during the day (unless there was a gap, that's handled separately - see below). It isn't important at what point during the day this happened, all that matters is that at some point, yesterday's high was broken and a trade entered.

2. I then check today's close and compare it with the entry price at yesterday's high. The difference between the two is the profit or loss. So if the day's high triggers the signal but the price then goes back down and closes low then the strategy makes a loss. If today's close is above yesterday's high, then the strategy makes a profit.

**Caveat about gaps**: If today gaps up above the high of the signal candle then that messes up the entry, so you can't enter at yesterday's high anymore and instead the entry is taken as the open of today's candle.
It‚Äôs there. It‚Äôs just a little confusing because he wrote a np.where() inside of another np.where()
[deleted]
Haven‚Äôt yet had the time either. I‚Äôll get around to it and circle back. OP said that he tested against several other benchmarks and said the results were some somewhere so I suspect it would work for spy. Also, my pretty much mimics SPX so I don‚Äôt see why it wouldn‚Äôt work. Certainly the volume is there.
5 Months Update of Live Automated Tarding
5 Months update of Live Automated Trading

Hi everyone, following my initial post 5 months ago, ( https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/s/lYx1fVWLDI )  that a lot of you have commented, here is my 5 months update.



I‚Äôve been running my strategies live, and I‚Äôm pretty happy with the results so far. 
The only errors are due to human interaction (had to decide if I keep positions overnight or no, over weekends, etc‚Ä¶) and created a rule, so it should not happen anymore. 

5 past months:
+27.26%
Max drawdown: 4.71%
Sharpe Ratio: 2.54

I should be able to get even better results with a smarter capital splitting (currently my capital is split 1/3 per algo, 3 algos) 

I‚Äôll also start to work on Future contracts that could offer much bigger returns, but currently my setup only allows me to automatically trade ETFs.

Let me know what you think and if you have ideas to increase performance :) 

Nice! Looks like you are using IBKR, right? Sandbox or real thing? I've got an algo going with the Sandbox account, would be interested to see if you learned anything when moving from Sandbox to real - like with regards to unexpected fees, etc.
What's your beta vs SPY or QQQ? Seems like both QQQ and SPY have similar/higher sharpe in that time period.
üòÇüòÇüòÇ "Tarding"
Automated Tarding made me think I was in WSB for a minute.
Nice. That‚Äôs really good. How do you think that will hold up when we hit a bear market? Also, what platform is that?
I dont know. Your strategy returned almost 0% till the market began to FOMO and caused one of the best 4 months in historical term. If you just buy and hold you will get around the same return. It would be interesting to check the strategy in a whole different market condition.
Ahh, I remember my 1st 5 months live trading. Tbh man, squeeze the juice out of it while it's going well. Things can turn quickly and you can just as easily have 5mo of bad results. But if it continues like this then you might as well start raising capital. Keep it up and keep us posted when the market flips too.
Are you using a hard-coded strategy, or did you use some sort of machine learning algo? Congrats!
We prefer the term "regarding"
How do you automate? What platform and how do you code your strategies? 

Super cool and congrats
Impressive! Any literature you would suggest for the algo trading?
Wow!
Nice work! Thanks for sharing, always encouraging to reminder that other traders are profitable
Nice job, mate! What's your tech stacK?
I'm confused. I thought you were making tens of thousands per month. These live results are not consistent with your previous posts.
how many trades?
Where can I download DateTime data for:

- economic statistical releases
- FED Speeches
- Testimonys
- FOMC Meetings
- Board Meetings
- Beige Book
- Conferences

etc.

This data is extremely important and I can't seem to find a way to download it anywhere. I will pay a high price.
That‚Äôs amazing!
[deleted]
Yo thats awesome. Congrats. Hard work does pay off.
Nice, thanks for sharing
Not bad at all
Congrats! Looks pretty steady and drawdown isnt bad. You should be proud. How did your backtest do in 2018 and 2022? Besides 2008, they would be good years to test against. Personally I think 1/1/2018 until now are great for backtesting.
LFG Jerry! Been following you since first post. I was wondering if live trading has affected your winrate??

Keep it up!
I made a note to myself to check with you in 5 more months.
Nice
nice bro!
Nice drawdown. You can easily get a leverage of 5 and still be very safe. In that case, your return would be 130%.
La
what platform do you use?
Did you write the script?
Really nice. I‚Äôm in a very similar position. Currently walking forward a TV script on live account of very similar balance. 

My performance started well but hit a drawdown so decided to simplify and use a new exit method that greatly removes the chance of overfitting. Currently in the process of forward testing. 

Will DM as would love to share progress and get some feedback
what strategy do you use brother?
Trying to get into automated trading myself im a strong  coder but got no clue about trading strategies any suggestions?
What's your performance after taxes?

How do (or would you) calculate that as you go along aside from end of year statements from IBKR?
Nice
Long/short? Long only? Equities/options/futures? What's the market beta of this strategy? When I start a new strategy I like to take monthly returns and compare their standard deviations to the ones in the backtest
I might be missing something but the math doesn‚Äôt seem to work out. Starting at $25.6, a return of 27% should put you at a NAV of $32.5k
I break even with my tarding, I guess thats not a win, but not a loss either.
looks great!
Would you mind sharing your tech stack?
No compounding of capital right?
Impressive result man! Curious to say how it would perform with futures
Very nice!
This is awesome. I'm a complete noob here, any suggestions or tips on how to get started?
Great job you outperformed my discretionary Shape by .2 üòÑ
What strategy do you use?
Is this subreddit and thread just to post about automated trading in a show but not tell fashion? Or is it actually to provide insightful value on strategies and algo setups to include things like what the strat is, how it works, preferences and parameters? Otherwise who does it benefit other than a brag of sorts, in which case may be better for Twitter imo
Tarding can make you retarded. Dont tard folks. Sounds like a wsb word. Should go viral.
thats called lazy traders :( doing automated . ü§°ü§°, work the tf hard bro.
Bump!
same
At that time yes, but I backtested it on bear markets too, and very similar results
Lol
lol, I love it! I now have a new name for roughly 99% of my strategies!
Autotard regard
I was wondering if that was intentional, lol.
Lol no
I backtested it on bear markets too, similar results. Platform is IBKR
[my performance vs TQQQ](https://imgur.com/a/i26sPQD) Correlation of the past few weeks:
TQQQ: +0.91%
My portfolio: +17.32%

Here is why I don‚Äôt buy and hold
I‚Äôve been trading for more than 15 years :) I raise my capital, currently selling assets and relocating to a more tax-friendly place
I‚Äôm not American, sorry for language issues
Tradingview, Capitalise, and IBKR
Don't wanna be a party pooper or anything, but the markets been on a tear since last October. QQQ is up 27% since October too with a super small max drawdown like 4% too. It's been a smooth number go always up kind of environment lately. Since OP mentions trading ETFs as the strategy I wonder if there is anything substantially different here compared to just buy and hold.
Ten thousands by months? Why? Last posts were all backtests of $100k
Have to check the total, usually 0-3 trades per day
Have you checked tiingo's calendar API?
FRED API
this
Thank you for the support. Not much, I'm still between 75 to 85% win rate depending on algos, pretty happy with it
Past 5 months a leverage of 5 would have been very safe on QQQ too. In fact TQQQ is up +100% since last October with only small drawdowns, but it's not like it's going to be forever like this.
Ibkr
Yes
Mine, I created it 2 years ago and optimized it
Google ¬´¬†Quantified strategies¬†¬ª you‚Äôll find a lot of ideas of strategies ideas it‚Äôs awesome.

However to start I suggest you to code a classic investment strategy like Buy and hold on ETF. The strategy performance will be your benchmark for all your next strategies you will develop. üôÇ
I‚Äôm currently moving to a low tax country‚Ä¶
I did withdraws
That‚Äôs a very good thing, keep it up!
No compounding, I trade with the same amount and withdraw profits once in a while
Thank you, I‚Äôm currently working on this because profits would be much higher, but I have currently no way to automate my trades with futures. 
Backtests and paper trading on NQ are great
I use mine, I created it 2 years ago and worked to optimize it
Edges in automated trading disappear when they become widely known. This sub discusses general strategy ideas but no one is going to go into detail. Strategies in manual trading are much more subjective and not as systematic so people in this area don't mind sharing.
Yeah...
you're so misguided

I hope you wake up from that 'grind' mindset and realize you're being used like a tool
When you run your back test against the period you have been live, do you get the same results as the live portfolio?
Nice.
Sweet. I've been trading for about 10yr. What's your retirement strategy?
How do I get started and learning about it?
It's ok ... I was joking about your misspelled word "tarding"
My apologies
Could you elaborate a bit more? I currently trade with TV and IBRK, and I'm also a software developer, so I've been thinking of trying some algo trading.
Either way, hitting a button to take advantage of whatever tear the market is currently on is something I‚Äôd entertain
You‚Äôre right, but the strategy is not much correlated to the performance of the index
Yea I guess I misinterpreted your results. I thought you had profited 100k over 78 trades. I spent a few days reading all of your comments and trying to replicate your strategy on TQQQ thinking you had found a grail, haha. 

Still, this is impressive. Great job. Let's see how it does when the market turns.
that's some pretty robust performance. good stuff
I used the TradingView strategy optimiser as you recommended for my TQQQ, results have improve a lot! Only risking 2% per trade. Profit is great but sharpe low (0.6) and winrate also low (41%). Would you help me review it??

2 year backtest on 5min charts:

[https://imgur.com/a/fHbN7ZK](https://imgur.com/a/fHbN7ZK)
Yes, but it does not always go up. Many times, it goes down. That's why we design algos.
Is it still trend + stochastic?
What models did you use bro?
Nice one. Whats your win rate % and profit factor at?
Yes 95% similar results. The thing is I never put 100% of capital into one strategy so of course final result is a little bit lower with mixed strategies
I‚Äôm currently selling my assets and moving a a tax friendly country
I also apologise, I at times words wrong too
I send TV webhooks to Capitalise app that send orders to IBKR. 
My next goal is to directly connect to the IBKR API to have a better control and being able to trade futures too
That button is called NVDA calls üòÇ
Index up 27%. Your strategy up 27%. Yeah, sure, absolutely no correlation there...
Backtest with 100k are profitable by 100k in a year, (between 90 and 110%) depending on strategies, that‚Äôs why you were thinking this :) I‚Äôll be able to trade with more than 100k in one or 2 months so we‚Äôll see..
Thank you
Looks good! You can also try on different time frames, or add some filters to avoid false signals
Yes, still the same strategy
Winrate 79-85% depending on algos (I run 3) and profit factor between 4-4.6
If you're a US citizen, that will only work if you renounce your US citizenship
Why waste time say lot word when few word do trick
Oof dangerous depending on those webhooks.

They've costed me a lot in the past
Haha fr !! It‚Äôs like using Oddjob with the golden gun in 007
2 different things, I wouldn‚Äôt be confident to put all my money on a ETF and wait‚Ä¶

[Perf vs TQQQ](https://imgur.com/a/i26sPQD) Correlation of the past few weeks:

how is it going now?
I‚Äôm sold! How can I do this?
Have you shared any more details or won‚Äôt be?
That's super impressive. You mainly sticking to regular Indicators or do you run your own custom indicators/I corporate some ML/AI?

I have some similar results (from back tests) using a few indicators
Absolutely not US citizen
That's not true. You can move to us virgin islands and be virtually tax free, like 4%.
Really? What kind of issue did you get?
Wow!  that's a Good Reference from the Past
How's that two different things. Let's wait until there's more choppy waters and QQQ is down 10%+ in a month. Your strategy will probably be down a similar amount too.
Pretty strong
It‚Äôs a custom indicator I made, combining few regular indicators, no ML yet
Late hooks, sometimes no hooks.

Maybe they've fixed it up but I would get some hooks an hour late
Not at all, you can check my previous posts from 6 months ago with years of backtests
Backtest is a fancy word for overfitting, let's wait and see until it actually trades a choppy market with real money. Please report back once VIX spikes for more than a month. Not trying to be condescending here, I'm genuinely interested in your results. It's just that the past 5 months are probably not a reliable estimate of future performance, it's been almost too easy lately.

Have you back tested on the last few months and compared it to your live results? Getting backtests to not overfit and be an accurate estimate of live trading is challenging.
I've been working in this quant industry for 10 years and billions of dollars. Not a single person that knows what they are doing uses backtests as a core component in their process.
Sure, I‚Äôm not bragging or anything, just sharing my work :)
Your the type of person that will see a person walk on water and say it‚Äôs because he can‚Äôt swim
I 100% believe you, but as long as it works‚Ä¶
> Not a single person that knows what they are doing uses backtests as a core component in their process.

What do they use?
have sound methodology for your signals with structural and theoretical justification with an excellent pre-existing risk framework; evaluate quality live with walk forward.

day to day work is always in improving parts of the stack ie. infra, methodology, new data/information sources. if your system doesn't work you have a methodology issue.

what it doesn't look like is trying a bunch of different shit in backtests. it doesn't look like binary rules-based strategies, forming a portfolio by allocating 33% to three random signals, it doesn't look like ranked lists of stocks or screeners, it doesn't look like fixed sizings, it doesn't look like some perfect combination of TA chart stuff.

you design the full end-to-end stack from first principles with zero backtesting involved and then you test in live walkforward. if its not working you keep working on the stack (still from first principles). you might backtest batches at the very end once your already running live to see what kind of DDs/profile you could expect in certain regimes (for your full system) and determine if your future work should go towards supplementing with a high skew strategy etc.
Road to $6MM #1
I'm starting a weekly series documenting my journey to $6MM. Why that amount? Because then I can put the money into an index fund and live off a 4% withdrawal rate indefinitely. Maybe I'll stop trading. Maybe I'll go back to school. Maybe I'll start a business. I won't know until I get there.

I use algorithms to manually trade on Thinkorswim (TOS), based on software I've written in Python, using the ThetaData API for historical data. My approach is basically to model price behavior based on the event(s) occurring on that day. I exclusively trade options on QQQ. My favorite strategy so far is the short iron condor (SIC), but I also sell covered calls (CC) on 500 shares I have set aside for a down payment on an apartment just to generate some additional income while I wait. My goal is to achieve a 6.8% daily ROI from 0DTE options. For the record, I calculate my defined-risk short ROI based on gross buying power (i.e. not including premium collected). Maybe I should calculate it based on value at risk?

So this week was a week of learning. I've been spending a few hours a day working on my software. This week's major development was the creation of an expected movement report that also calculates the profitability of entering various types of SIC at times throughout the day. I also have a program that optimizes the trade parameters of several strategies, such as long put, long call, and strangle. In this program, I've been selecting strategies based on risk-adjusted return on capital, which I document [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/1bwtrlu/best_metric_for_comparing_strategies/). I'm in the process of testing how the software does with selecting based on Sharpe ratio.

Here's my trading for the week:

Monday: PCE was released the Friday before, but the ISM Manufacturing PMI came out on this day. I bought a ATM put as a test and took a $71 (66%) loss. I wasn't confident in the results of my program for this event, so I wasn't too surprised.

Tuesday: M3 survey full report and Non-FOMC fed speeches (which I don't have enough historical data for). I was going to test a straddle but completely forgot. I sold 5 CC and took a $71 (67%) loss.

Wednesday: ISM Services PMI. I don't have historical data for this event yet, so I sold 5 CC and made $157 (95%) profit.

Thursday: More non-FOMC fed speeches. I sold 5 CC and made $117 (94%) profit. I wish I had done a strangle though. There was a  $9 drop starting at 2 PM. Later this month, I will acquire more historical data, so I'll be prepared.

Friday: Employment Situation Summary. I tested my program today. I opened with a strangle and closed when I hit my profit goal, determined by my program. I made $72 (27%) profit. About 30 minutes before market close, I sold 5 CC for $47 (86%) profit and sold a SIC for $51 (13%) profit.

Starting cash: $4,163.63

Ending cash: $4,480.22

P/L: $316.59

Daily ROI: 1.5%

Conclusion: I didn't hit my profit goals this week, because I was limiting my trading while testing out my software. If I had invested my full portfolio, I would have had a great week. I will continue testing my software for another week before scaling up. I will still do full portfolio SIC on slow days, however, as I'm already comfortable with that strategy. Thanks for listening.
Do you understand that if you made an average of 6.8% per day on your $4k that you would reach your $6MM goal in less than six months? Does that sound reasonable?

As someone who's been at this for awhile, I can tell you that you must learn to manage your expectations. You will make mistakes, your system will face drawdowns, the market will change from its past behavior. You must expect all of this, or your disappointment will lead to poor decisions. 

I'm glad you're documenting this. I think you should spend more time working with historical data and finding a well-defined strategy that gives you an excellent backtest. That would be an interesting process to document and for us to read about. I would actually look forward to it. But in the meantime, nobody cares about your daily P/L. It doesn't mean anything until you actually have a strategy and a larger sample size than one week.

Your confidence is excellent. You will need that. Good luck.
Once I read my goal is to reach x percent daily, I know this person does not understand trading. 

The market some days will give you a lot of opportunities and some days none. Some times you‚Äôll have 0% ROI for weeks and then one day you‚Äôll hit 20%.

6.8% daily on a consistent basis has never been done and will never be done.
You need $240k/yr to live off of, but you can only afford to put $4k into a trading portfolio?
Hahaha. I‚Äôm sitting here with close to $6m (mostly in broad indices) trying to learn how to algotrade so I am not subject to the whim of the market.  If you had a system that worked up to $6m, why would you shut it down?

if I had a system that gave me a steady 1% per month I would be set.
Good luck. A dollar and a dream. We‚Äôre all chasing our pot of gold
This is clearly a troll. Fun to read though
If your algo makes you $6M you‚Äôre not going to put it indo an index fund that makes you 4%
Options on QQQ = path to ruin on so many levels it isn't even funny. Commissions + spreads on options are so wide you can drive a truck thru them + inevitable downturns in the market will wipe out this account. The title of this post should be changed to "Fast Track to Zero". This "strategy" should be taken out back and shot before it does any real harm to its owner's financial well-being.
Good luck. In a bull market even a coin toss can pick good trades. In a bull market implied volatility is low, so whenever it goes up it is bound to come down, and this is why picking pennies in front of steam rollers works in a bull market. The hard trick to master is to pick enough pennies in front of the steam roller to cover all your losses when the bear market starts. I think you will find that you can never pick enough pennies to cover those losses when the bear market starts. 0DTE is also very high gamma which adds to this problem. You cannot rollover like you can with 21 DTE.

Sounds like you are an optimist which works well in this kind of market. Be careful when geopolitics and vol events shows up "unexpectedly" like yesterday (and hence your loss).

Good luck.

You are starting with $4k and want to trade your way to $6m? Okay:

* If you make 10% per year, which on average is market beating, you will have $72k in 30 years.
* At the very, very improbable Medallion Fund rate of 66% you will reach $6m in 28 years.
* I assume by your lofty goals you want to reach your goals within a decade. At 100% consistent yearly return you will reach $6m just a bit over 10 years.
* With your conservative 6.8% daily return, you will reach $6m before 4 months. Wow! Plus you are using safe investments like 0DTE options! Wow! Wen Moon?!
Definitely will keep one eye on your progress. As a suggestion, you can maybe start some YouTube work.exiting.good luck bro!!!
That's a pipe dream, to be honest, but never say never. You're are better bulding an algo that makes a steady return and make money for helping others make 10-20% a year. But with that said, best of luck. Let us know how it goes.
What is your risk tolerance?
Why don‚Äôt you model sports. The betting markets are much less efficient.
We need positive people like you who can dream. If you can dream big you can achieve it as well. Good luck.
Looks like its going great so far. $12k lost and you‚Äôre only looking to make $6 million. I do have a question though. Looks like your strat is based off of ‚Äúevents‚Äù. How are handling the eclipse tomorrow?
Well, bro, that's a big dream. I've been struggling to gain 2% a week in leveraged trading, and I barely made it for a month. It's good to dream big as long as you don't let failure get you.
Backtesting ain't gonna work if you want profit like that. Any strategy was made already ain't work cuz marginal revenue diminishes. You got to make new strategy based on indicators and unique observations. Or you maybe need to even create indicators yourself. Before the market gets used to it, earn the * out of it.
Otherwise you got to play news trading but not like news classifieds trading. More like you get news minutes or hours before the others. And that's illegal in a lot of countries.
If you want 6.8% a day, you got to play unusual. Cuz with that expectation,  genuinely speaking that's not investing anymore. You will need to beat other traders' ass, and rob their money not long after. Then you need to know who you are trying to mess up with.
I sincerely wish you the best luck, run fast and don't let frustration catch you.
One last word if I am not too talkative. Play now when it's still good, storm is coming.
Good luck OP. Looking forward to your #2 #3 and so on!
I like the fact that you‚Äôre looking at things that MOVE the markets such as scheduled economic releases, rather than just price action.
Goodluck dude!
Interesting‚Ä¶ I want to track your progress as you report it.
Pretty cool
Very nice. Following your progress.
Thank you for sharing, good luck on your journey, keep us updated
Nice
You'll have better luck hitting your goal with 0dte options, good luck...
I'm not sure I totally understand everything. How much do you plan risking per trade?
I can share you this , with 4K (even 1k)  you should set up your portfolio in trades, also in property (partially reit for example), gov bond / fund (joint), cash flow that can generate interest/value , extremely good discipline of watching your spending and keep moving aka even lost (use your intelligent to get it back) aka don‚Äôt hold with general people‚Äôs sentimental

Forget historical data ( you need to know pro investor still loose even they have a TEAM to analyst ‚Ä¶) my 2 cents
I hope you lose all your money fucker
Look forward to the follow up post when the account is blown up
when did this sub turn into a hub for blogs?
I really, really needed this laugh!  thanks, you should be a comedian!
I think many comments are unnecessarily harsh (pointing fun without justifying their skepticism), but I would strongly recommend reading the folks who explain their reasoning and experience for why your expectations are likely wayyyy too high. Not saying you can't get amazing returns, but what you're aiming for has the problem of \*sounding\* somewhat reasonable while actually being absolutely insanely high expectations.
I love it! I‚Äôm following to stay updated. Good luck and God speed!
Will u ever share this ALGO/ strategy for others to use. Ik the comments are salty but I had the same idea in my mind just don‚Äôt know how to execute and I can‚Äôt code, unfortunately. I‚Äôm interested in this definitely gonna follow the journey
4K to 6MM is impossible to do by skill, it‚Äôs just pure luck at this point
Uff! There‚Äôs a lot of negativity in these comments!

It seems like you are just getting exposed to exponential growth! I remember when I looked at an excel spreadsheet with like 25% a week‚Ä¶ what can happen in a year is mind blowing!

Don‚Äôt let that high go! But as you continue trading you‚Äôll likely find how sometimes reality doesn‚Äôt match pure math ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

From the little you showed it seems like you have the possibility of having high returns but your losses offsets them. Have you considered putting stop losses on your trades? If you are wrong, just be wrong and take a 15% or 20% loss and call it. And if you are right take that 95%.

With a proper profit/loss ratio you can be correct only 50% of the time and still be profitable. Don‚Äôt hold losers! Don‚Äôt let them get to -67% for goodness sake!

If you have a way to trade and make a profit the second and most important part is to find a way to not return that money to the market!

Good luck!
Are you going to post your trades here before you actually do them so we can do them together?
Interesing!

3 years ago I pass through the learning curve of authenticating via Oath 2 in TDA and coded a bot which was trading also exclusively options. In my case it was a very simple approach buying CALLS or PUTS depending on some criteria I establish expecting certain stocks to go up or down... never really manage to make some money with that but the learning to fully automate was very valuable.

Now I am not in TDA anymore but moved to Charles Schwab who recently granted me access as developer. I just finished the code to pass through the Oauth 2 successfully.

I only like doing options for trading... the philosophy I want to follow is very simple: only invest long-term in ETFs, save in Bitcoin and trade in options.  
  
The problem I have is that I am still quite new to options trading and do not really have a strategy to implement.

Can see you indicate you exclusively trade options on QQQ... but you also said something about other 500 shares, so QQQ is not exclusive then?... could you give me any advice on what strategy to follow?
Hi how does python work as is it code or a easier method? I have tradestation. With so called easy language. Thanks
What is keeping you from transitioning from manual trading to fully autonomous trading? Good luck!

Don‚Äôt listen to people that say it‚Äôs impossible. You can do it as long as you protect your capital and learn from your mistakes.

if I made 6.8% daily ROI, 2 days in a row, I would take the remaining 250 days off (roughly 252 trading days per year) üòÇ
that
I agree with you entirely, but just to beat the other pedantic nerds, your final sentence depends heavily on the definition of consistent.
I should clarify that I'm trying to reach that number as a long term average. I don't expect every day will be a win, as I didn't win every day this week either. I didn't have a good opportunity every day this week either. I know that 6.8% daily average is ambitious but I think I can pull it off. I'll document my progress so if I'm wrong or blow up my account, you can say I told you so.
Furthermore, you won't believe how insufficient $240k/year will seem in the future -- IF you get used to what it can buy you today.
And that‚Äôs before tax imagine that

There are some hedge funds kind of like that*

*Insulated from losses because of great hedges and trading primarily leveraged fixed income.

Are you withdrawing form that to live or continuing to add ?
I wish I could buy options on this strategy going to 0, then I'd be the one ratcheting my account up to 6MM.
I might. Trading involves a lot of risk. A single IC going wrong could mean a loss of 85%.
You sound like Mr Wonderful from Shark Tank!
Through TOS, commissions and fees are about $0.56 per leg. Bid ask spreads are usually $0.01. I'm not sure what you mean.
I appreciate what you're saying. I'm going to be doing research into the pandemic bear market to see what events caused the market to move or whether there was just a significant downward trend regardless of events. I'm aware that the market will shift eventually, so I will reassess the situation as soon as I start to notice significant movements without events or movements that are higher than historical averages. Thanks for the reminder.
I'm currently re-reading Trading for a living by Elder and it's funny because he specifically talks about people with systems that work in particular market cycles but as soon as the market goes sideways or in circles the 'system' flaws are exposed and the losses flow in ...
What black swan if the risk in IC is limited?
There will be historical patterns to market movements based on fed speeches. Even if that means that no usual trade would be profitable, that's more information to inform decision making.
What is NY session? I don't trade futures, just options on QQQ directly.

I've been live trading with this approach since January 17, 2024. I took some big losses early on, because I didn't know what events to look out for when doing SIC. My cumulative P/L is -$12,738.77. If I can hit my daily ROI goal, I should be back to break even within 21 trading days. However, I'm now confident that I will be able to identify all events and react accordingly. There are 24 events I look out for now, and I optimize my strategies separately for each event.
>With your conservative 6.8% daily return, you will reach $6m after 2.5 years.

At 6.8% daily, he should hit it in under 4 months.
You miscounted your zeroes for Medallion Fund (I think you did $6B, not $6M). At 66% per year, it'll take around 14-15 years to hit $6M from $4K. Overall though I totally agree with your point!
Pretty high. I'm prepared that I could lose 80% in one day if a trade goes very wrong.
Damn, that sounds like a s smash and grab more than it does trading. Get in, get your shit, and get out before they find you.

Edit: with homeboy being an ‚Äúevent‚Äù trader, do you think he priced in the eclipse happening in a few hours?
My more recent posts got downvoted a lot, so I'm not sure where to report. However, my account is now at $10.5K.
And you started with $4,163.63?
I think you meant to say "regress" instead of progress.
For short trades, I will use gross option buying power (i.e. not including premium collected) equivalent to my cash balance. For long trades, depending on what level of losses my simulations predict, I'll do 25-100% of my cash.
I'm not familiar with TradeStation, but I am skilled at Python. I have to write all of the code for getting data and back testing, but I also have complete control over how the trades are structured and what I can optimize in my back tests.
I just really don't want to go through all of the effort to learn a broker's API. I don't have a high enough frequency where I would need to automate, and I have time to enter and monitor the trades. If either of those conditions changed, I would consider automating. I'm also still in the phase of live trading with small amounts to test the system, so I wouldn't want to automate anyway until I had more confidence in the system.
My account is up to $10.5K.
No, 6.8% per day is completely impossible.
So what you're saying is that as long as I protect my capital and learn from my mistakes, I too can achieve 17,000% returns?
Positive affirmations have no place in trading.  6.8%/day avg is not technically impossible, but over a long period of time the probability of achieving it without busting the account is infinitesimally small.  This is largely due to the position sizes that you would need to trade with in order to achieve such a result.  Learn about risk of ruin and kelly criterion.  Even if you have a positive EV, if you size your positions too high you can *still* bust your account. 

Interestingly, your advice to "protect your capital" is precisely why 6.8% per day is fantastical.  Protecting capital means, among other things, sizing positions in a way that mitigates risk of ruin.  This necessarily reduces your return.  

You can't have your cake (keep your capital) and eat it too (get crazy high returns).
its just impossible, its the nature of trading.

6.8% daily isn‚Äôt ambitious. .68% daily is ambitious!!
> I know that 6.8% daily average is ambitious but I think I can pull it off

If you think you can pull it off, why stop at $6M? You'd get to $6M in 111 days, $50M a month after that, and $500M a month after that.
6.8% daily on average isn't ambitious, it's ridiculous. That's over 1700% CAGR assuming a constant book size. Even our most capacity constrained, HFT books don't achieve those kinds of numbers. 

I don't want to be a wet blanket, but you should really set more realistic expectations for yourself or you're doomed to failure. Just my two cents. Good luck.
If you can pull 6.8% daily, it will take you 467 days to have $1 billion.
Correct, that's why i am aiming for the same goal as OP although i actually need $50k/year to live now. With calculated avg inflation of 2.5%, it would take 65 years for $240k to have the purchasing power of $50k today.
Yeah that cracks me up. I‚Äôm looking for table scraps. He wants the house. 1% a month get some 12+% a year.  Taxes take a third, inflation takes a third, the fam takes the last third.
What are some examples?
I have a regular job that pays the bills.
Why do you think that particular risk only applies once the account reaches $6M?  Is that risk any different when your account is at $1M? What about $100k? or perhaps $4k?

Or are you going for a lotto play to hit $6M and then you'll lock it away if you're lucky?
Wow, I didn't realize that the spreads were that tight on those options, and that is indeed a very fair commission. That won't be as much of a drag on your potential earnings, which means that you'll simply lose money slower than I originally thought.
Exactly.
really good book, like Steenbarger's and Tensile Trading.
NY session normally means the regular trading hours (not "premarket" or "post market"). Monday through Friday 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time.
> I'm now confident that I will be able to identify all events and react accordingly

yeah. I'm glad you have better algos than everyone else on this site
Curious on what the 24 events are?
>under 4 months.

Thanks, edited
Ever thought it possible for a trade to go very wrong 2 days in a row?
Honestly I think the  information gap of earning 6.8% a day is so huge that it's not anything other than hit and run. Because market will adopt whatever your magic strategy is really fast.
And if it's not some secrets few people know, why other traders can't earn that money? They are stupid? Definitely not.
In all, I think trading is all about information. 
I do hope op understands even he classified 101 kinds of news, the next one may not fit in his model since our world is changing dynamically.
What's important is the principle of fear and greedy index and how to explain it. If anyone has such an unique understanding, one could earn some real money.
But if op doesn't have exit line and stop loss line according to the correction of events, well... Event is happening really fast, so does your profit and loss :)
In case you're not being facetious, I did not do anything different based on the eclipse.
You're risk looks really high. You're not suppose to risk over like 2% per trade. As long as you know the risk and are ok with it.
didn't you see? he's going back to school. Or starting a business (more profitable than trading and making 10M a year). And while he's making 1000% a year, once he gets to 6M, he'll put it all in an index fund and make 4% a year thereafter. Totally reasonable, totally well thought-out plans
Hey, maybe this guy is just leagues better than RenTech, Two Sigma, Citadel, HRT, and every other hegdefund that employs hundreds of the smartest PhDs and ends up making like 1% of what this guys goal is.
1700% CAGR would be 0.68% daily (which is already ridiculous).

6.8% daily, the number that OP stated, would get you from $1 to $26B (= $1.068\^365) in a year. After two years, your wealth would be 100000x higher than the current total global wealth.

It's already be amazing if you can generate 10% CAGR in uncorrelated returns (compared to an index fund) as an individual retail trader. Converted to an average daily return, that'd be 0.026%. OP's expectation is off by two orders of magnitude.

(And it's just not useful to think in terms of daily returns for directional investments into stocks, as your actual daily returns will differ widely from your long term average, just because daily vol is much greater than daily avg return.)
BTW, I'm not trying to be mean, I just don't want to see you lose money using a strategy that has already been proven to be a losing endeavor. Better to paper trade a strategy first if you really have a lot of conviction in it before deploying real dollars.
"Well though out" (i.e school of Tiktok)
It's tough to make a higher percentage than RenTech, but it's certainly not impossible with retail amounts. The Medallion Fund is capped at 10B, at a certain point, trades become so large that they distort the market too much. They could easily earn a higher percentage, just nobody will beat them in absolute amounts.

For example, in crypto, a lot of smart money only bothers with the largest coins because why run infrastructure for a market that only allows you to trade 10k before slippage eats you? At those amounts, you see inefficiencies that have been well documented long before computers became involved.
Oh do shut up, you don't have a clue about trading. If you did, you would understand the difference between institutional and retail trading. You really think a fund having to get a return on billions of dollars of investment is competing for the same alpha somebody trying to grow a 5k account is? Stop peddling this tired about line about Rentech and others, having legions of people with phds as if that is the differentiator. I can tell you have never traded in your life.
It's possible to do a bit better than them at lower volumes, but it is not possible to consistently do 100 times better than them.
Lessons learned one year after going live
Launched my algo live exactly one year ago. In addition to a personal milestone, watching it run live has been a completely different experience than watching test results. Some valuable lessons are learned only from observing live behaviors.

My algo is 100% automated. It trades a group of major forex pairs. Long, short trades are symmetrical. 

The most important lesson is that live trading gave me clues on what to improve. Live trading slows everything down compared to testing. I was forced to observe the process instead of focusing on the results during testing. The wild swing of EURJPY in June caused a large drawdown. When I saw how it happened, it led me to an improvement idea. Another EURJPY swing happened in December again. My algo not only survived, but also profited from it this time.

I run my algo on different broker platforms. The results are tangibly different. I believe it has to do with spreads and fees and interest rates. It was hard to tell from testing.

Although the overall results conformed to the tested and expected behaviors, it is still eye opening to see how the market behaves thanks to live trading slows everything down. Something expected to be rare is actually not so rare. It was amazing to see how the market can go from dead quiet to neck-breaking speed without warning. 

In conclusion, without risking too much, it is worthwhile to run your algo live regardless profitable or not. It gives you improvement ideas, confidence and experience that you can't get otherwise.
Obviously don‚Äôt need to share the strategy but what helped you gain the confidence that your system is robust enough to go live?
I've been trading for many years discretionary, but have been live as an algo trader for a similar time to you.

It's hard reading the sub when pure algo traders keep banding about geometric brownian motion. I'd advise people to trade discretionary for at least a year, it will give you so many ideas for building out your own edges.

Once you have edges, you can start quantifying them with code and building on this using established risk management and trading techniques.
Thanks for sharing your thoughts after going live. 
Did you have to adjust any settings after you went live?
There is always a difference between simulation and live trading. This is why best practice is considered to incubate for at least 6 months and when live, monitor performance for 3 months to ensure your strategy is still within backtested statistics.
Would you share what your algos overall concept is?
is it pure algorithming without ML ?
Thanks for sharing -- never ended up profitable when working on trading algorithms ~2 years ago, but your experience was the same as mine:

1. Get an actual algo up and running trading small amounts of real money as soon as possible. I "paid attention" to measures like sharpe ratio and max drawdown, but never took them seriously until running with live money. The game is entirely different once one or two trades are taking away a month of good trades.
2. Analyze the actual trades the algo made and see if there's room for optimization, e.g. "can you write a rule that would have stopped 2 losing trades at the cost of losing 1 profitable trade. Is it reasonable to expect this rule to work in the future?"

Definitely left with a practical trial/error and "better not perfect" philosophy rather than "find the right complex algorithm" philosophy.
Could you share resources/books you found the most useful on your journey to building your system?
Can you talk about your setup? (Language, ide, etc)
Can you share from where you are getting the data stream ?

Is it real time or end of the day feed ?

Thanks for sharing your live experience. Is it really helpful.
Thanks for sharing 
What is the broker you use?
Appreciate you sharing your takeaways. Curious about your overall system, not just your actually reading algorithm. How do you manage portfolio risk or determine order sizing? How do you determine the exit? Is it modular and multithreaded or pretty simple and you just have a set size you generally trade when your algo spits out the signal.

Thanks!
Congrats! Do you mind sharing the delta between your model‚Äôs expected gain and the actual gain? And what caused the delta?
What was your total turnover in USD for the year?
Thanks for sharing your thoughts ! Can you talk about how did you choose the amount / percentage of wealth to alocate to your trading algo for this first year ?
How long did it take to build and lab before you went live?
What was your final return in one year?
I too man , My algo was doing well i got payouts from prop firm but suddenly the end of October losing streaks started caused by GJ and EurGbp , i discovered there was an error on a particular exit and filter code and also discovered flaws on GJ entry parameters and EurGbp filter sets , i made all the modifications and adds necessary from studying the losing streak , now my algo will never have problems going foward , 2024 and beyond will be super interesting üî•ü•π, cant wait for January
What are the costs for running your algo?
Thanks for sharing ur experience.. which data u backtest with??
How did you get the real time data?
What would a very basic algo look like for a beginner just to play around? Did you use some moving average logic or something more complex?
The benefices you describe seems to be those of forward testing, wich can be achieved thrue demo account, or maybe I missed something ?
Great job and thanks for sharing.  Did you figure all the tech aspects out yourself or did you have help?
Will you share it out / publicise it anywhere?
With everything you've learned, do you wish you did anything differently from the start?
It's great to here that you are making a good return from pure algo. Gives me hope as a complete beginner. I just have a few questions if you don't mind:

1. Can you tell me what are the factors one would see the difference in the back tests and the actual forward tests?

2. You mentioned that there is a slight difference in the results of different brokers. If I want to backtest a strategy, will I have to get the data of each broker to backtest or a single data source will do? 

3. Since I also plan on coding strategies in Python like you did, is it reasonable to do intraday strategies using Python or should we stick to swing? What is the lowest timeframe we can go to for trading using python according to your experience?
thank you, this is very good to know. How do you feel the fully automated algo though ? I still have another full time job, thus now I am more considering interlay trading ( manual ). If it's fully automated, then i can go for intraday signals, but I heard it's very difficult if you have fully automated strategy ( hard to control )
[deleted]
Did you do any sandbox testing against live data? Meaning let your algo see the live data, but only track trades internally to validate strategy?
Well said, no matter how perfect your tests go, the real scenario problems are like the grinders that polish your idea/product.   
Better to experience than sit and think down with your hypothesis.
My Algo is still at the point where I have to interfere with the Prime Directive and manually adjust it every now and then. I thought once the strategy itself was functional that everything would be easy (Boy was I wrong). What tips do you have for getting over that hurdle where you can confidently run a strategy for days on end?
Thanks for sharing. How much principal did you put into the algo for it to return 60%?
What backtest platform did you use?
Nice job, thanks for the insights
Any particular time frames your targeting 10 min, 60 min daily?
Questions from someone who has a curious itch to satisfy, what is your trading platform ? coding language etc ? I want to learn how to program an algo trader and maybe even take it live, who knows.
Thank you for your insight but roughly how long would you recommend training and testing an algo, and should I split my back test data 50/50?
This is goals, really can‚Äôt wait for my strategy one day to be 100% automated.
Back and forward testing. I used ohlc data from 2006 to 2022.
I did. But only after seeing the improvement opportunity and more testing. Since the improvement was big enough, I decided to change the settings.
There are only two types of algo in general: mean reversing or trend following. Mine is mean reversing with some special sauce in position entry, exiting and sizing.
Not ml in the standard constructs. But I do employ the concepts of parameterizing, training, optimization and validation.
After some early failures, I recognized the approach is more important than techniques, and learned not to dismiss any idea too fast. I  read anything I could find, books, papers, blogs, articles, on many subjects, markets, trading, finance, economics, math, statistics , ai, games, psychology, group behaviors, programming and across a wide period from the most recent back to books written in the 50s and 60s. I really can't pinpoint a few sources. Every bit helped.
During the Christmas holiday timeframe Udemy was running significant discounts on a lot of their ML/algo trading classes. That‚Äôs where I‚Äôve invested most of my time for now.
Just vanilla python on windows or Ubuntu server.
I got my historical data from oanda. It is freely available, but you need to clean it a little. My algo uses 1hr bar data.
So far 8cap is the best for me.
It is pretty simple. The trade size depends on the confidence of winning. Trade more when the odds are more in your favor. Existing is the seriously secret sauce.
I forward tested seven years. The returns ranged from 30% to 80%. This year is about 60%. It is within the expected range.
It triggered about 400 around-trip trades during the year. The return is about 60%.
The amount is something I can afford to lose while significant enough to keep me engaged. 

The first year risk is not only not knowing how my algo would perform in real life. The historical data I used is most likely not accurate. The broker may not be reliable. The infrastructure and my code need to be tested. There may be risks that I don't know yet.

I'd ramp up gradually from here. At least the winning can offset possible future losses.
About 2 years.
About 60%
Cloud servers are cheap these days. It costs less than $10 a month.
1 hour OHLC
This is the tricky part. No matter what I say, somebody will disagree. I am in no position to declare what works, what doesn't, what it is, what it isn't. An algo can be anything. (Somewhat like a horcrux in Harry Potter) 

You can certainly play with ma, indicators to begin with. It tends to be an individualistic adventure. There's no set path which is both fun and frustrating at times.
Of course you can do it with a demo account. But I have occasionally seen differences between demo and live accounts. I didn't spend time investigating. Can't quantify it.
Yes, I put everything together myself. There's a lot of back and forth between the algo and the tech. I can't see myself doing it otherwise.
It has been a personal journey. There has been no map or manual. One step led to another. None of the discoveries is wasted.  In hindsight, I could have skipped the many, many failed algos. But I am not sure if I could be where I am without the previous failures and lessons. My journey is far from finished. I will continue to explore and experiment. There really isn't anything to regret.
Forward testing can be and should be done with historical data. The more testing the better. It should be indicative of live results.

Regarding data source, it depends on the assets you trade. For a decentralized market like forex, it's better to use data from the broker. For centralized markets like stocks, it shouldn't matter. But you should verify for yourself.

Unless you intend your edge to be speed, python is plenty fast. You are most likely limited by the API latency or network latency.
It's quite easy as long as you do some basic error handling like retry or ignore. API or webhook are subject to failures from time to time.
The forex market is said to be huge. I am still trading relatively tiny and haven't felt any constraint. There should not be constraint in theory even as I ramp up. It is remain to be seen.

Your second question is actually interesting. It turned out different markets can behave quite differently. For example, the future market is a lot more volatile than forex, like at least a few times more volatile. Among the commodities, some are less volatile such as gold. But it is still more volatile than forex. Therefore, my algo doesn't work well with futures. By extension, it won't work well with cryto. In the case of stock index, my algo couldn't beat buy-n-hold. I don't see one size fits all.
The closest thing to a sandbox is a demo account which I did briefly just to test out the code. Further tweakings were all done on live accounts. Since my input is only hourly price data, I have plenty of time to update my code in between trades.
I coded my own. 100%. It's simple logic to me. If you created your own strategy, why wouldn't you create your own tests?
I trained my model with 10 years of data and forward tested for 7 years. I stopped only because I ran out of data. This much of testing likely invalidates most algos as it happened to me. But I think having a bruised ego is better than losing real money.
>metatrader5

tks, ohlc data of forex? isn't forex 24x5?
Only ohlc data? And then you build the different features such as SMA or VWAP from that data right?... I'm building an algo using time and sales data and neural networks. Any help with sourcing that data? I'm talking every single order that went through on a given day from beginning of pre-market to end of after-hours.
>bserve the pro

which broker do you use? Does it have API? If no, how do you put order (via metatrader?)?
Can you talk about data cleaning?
Your model inputs are just 1hr OHLCV or do you also use items like bid/ask etc?
Have to say I love "Existing is the seriously secret sauce."
Existing? Or exiting?
Awesome thanks for the response!
Thank you for sharing!
Noice
>oanda

insane, nice
How much effort? Were you full time on this?
What was your max drawdown in that same period?
Nice work!
Broker's data or an external data
To echo and add. Demo accounts don‚Äôt have latency. Your broker on demo accounts fills 100% of your orders, demo accounts manage giant swings (like the fed announcements) with no problems. I‚Äôm live testing as well and adding logic to handle all that stuff
Did you scale up the algo to match the volatility of futures, or stocks? In particular, trade more frequently?
Is it feasible to trade off of minute data in your set-up?
Thanks!
Well... the question kind of answers itself. Confirmation bias.
Thanks for your reply, ~~just to confirm you tested your bot live for 7 years?~~
Try checking NASDAQ data link they have a lot of stuff. Can be pricey tho
There is one broker where I use their API. The other ones all use metatrader5. They are very similar in practice.
Things like extra data after the market is closed, missing data if the price didn't change. Check against data from another source.
I don't need bid/ask for signal.
Exiting
Yes, full time.
It was about 15%. But my algo would allow up to 25% before intervening. It's a balance between drawdown and profitability.
Broker s
Ah that's interesting to me !

How much lag do you see at your broker ? And what broker is this ?

I'm working on demo and think I'll go live on january first, to work with announcement, so both your situations means to me :)
>metatrader5

oh, then I guess you running it on window os without docker? I try to config running metatrader on linux and connect to it using mt5linux, it worked but not stable (easy to getting freeze after running long enough). If you run in docker with linux, can I have your docker image or dockerfile build for reference?
i recently got trades data which has a lot of gaps, can you suggest the best way to do the clean up ?
Thank you!
I wish I could run mt5 on Linux. Didn't work for me either. Using windows server now.
Sometimes the gaps are there because the ohlc data didn't change during the gaps.
My first Python Package (GNews) reached 600 stars milestone on Github

GNews is a Happy and lightweight Python Package that searches Google News and returns a usable JSON response. you can fetch/scrape complete articles just by using any keyword. GNews reached 100 stars milestone on GitHub



GitHub Url: [https://github.com/ranahaani/GNews](https://github.com/ranahaani/GNews)
Great work. Another "why didn't I think of that" moment fir me! 

Gave you another star, buddy! Kudos!
Hook this up to an ML model for sentiment analysis regarding a stock?

Edit: Starred!
Bravo!  My only critique is in your description.  It's certainly a nice and lightweight package.  But don't call it "happy".  I barely saw it crack a smile.
This is awesome! Do you do any proxying to avoid being banned?
Congratz! Those types of packages are what we need :D. Long live to the Open Source community
Brilliant work. Just like newsapi, but free!
does it circumvent Google censorship?
Absolutely useful for both qualitative and turning qualitative content to quantitative measurement.
Thank you for your great work!
Congratulations! More advance and tools useful for the retail army
Great work! Will check this out.
I am working on some code to do sentiment analysis on seeking alpha articles. I definitely want to check out your tool. Thank you for sharing this!
Very useful , many thanks
really nice, I will probably use it on my own open source project. thanks for sharing it with us
Can this be used to warn me of FED meeting or events where I should sit out volatility? 

I don't care about bias only the times os the significant events and NOT insignificant news
Cool. How would you use this to help with algo trading?
My FIRST thought as well, lmao. I already have a webscraper for this, I'm just gonna plug in this package now and see if it's easier (probably is)
Those dates are published on the FOMC's website.¬†
News sentiment analysis on a stock.
This already exists. Check out FinBert.
Hasn't finnhub had a similar thing for years now for free? Or is this different somehow?
Leave it to huggingface haha

I do more with the text than sentiment analysis usually, but if finbert can help extract the financially relevant text more consistently I'll definitely give it a whirl
I don't think this can replace FinBert.
Not replace finbert but be used as the data aggregator for finbert
Where Do You Get Your Data For Backtesting From? 
It seem like a proper thread is lacking that summarizes all the good sources for obtaining trading data for backtesting. Expensive, cheap, or maybe even free? I am referring to historical stock market data level I and level II, fundamental data, as well as option chains. Or maybe there are other more exotic sources people use? Would be great to brainstorm together with everyone here and see what everyone uses!

I use Schwab‚Äôs API and just store in a local database for backtesting.
For tick data, [dukascopy](https://www.dukascopy.com/trading-tools/widgets/quotes/historical_data_feed) has a free feed. Their data is based on quotes.

For 1-minute OHLC: [databento](https://databento.com/) (live and historical) and [firstratedata](https://firstratedata.com/) (historical only)

For daily, [csidata](https://www.csidata.com/) (that's the source behind Yahoo)
Norgate data. Has all the historical index constituents and delisted companies to avoid survivorship bias when building stock trading systems.

For the intra day guys, Norgate don't have intra day data. I don't understand why intra day is so popular with retail though, too hard to compete with instos in the short timeframes IMO.
Polygon offers the best developer experience I‚Äôm aware of, along with competitive pricing. However, there is a HUGE caveat that is essentially a deal breaker for any serious research work I do: I‚Äôve encountered multiple data accuracy issues in their stock data. These can range from duplicate entries in their flatfiles to incorrect stock splits data, which makes the entire adjusted OHLCV history for many tickers completely wrong. Data issues reported on their GitHub seem to stay open for months, if not longer. In my opinion, if you're looking for the highest quality data, there are better options at the moment, at least for stocks. Hopefully, they will work harder to rectify these issues in the future, as data quality is the most important factor for most users, because I think the infrastructure they have to serve the data is very user-friendly and I'd love to be able to trust their data more.  
Personally for the least amount of data issues I'd use Databento, or IQFeed, Barchart, or Quodd/Nanex for cheaper options but with a good track record of being very reliable.  
Another notable mention is financialmodelingprep, data seems of good quality and they offer a ton of fundamental endpoints, for the price I highly recommend trying it, there's tons of value.
[deleted]
Very nice sum up. Thank you a lot! I was using Databento and was very happy with it but a bit expensive.
I use databento or for downloading in csv backtestmarket
I use databento's python API. They're relatively new but only place I found with L2 data.
My understanding is norgate is gold standard for point in time if looking at universe of stocks at daily level but could be cost prohibitive to some with yearly subscription. Databento only has a few years of data which may not be of use at daily level. I'm looking at a quantrocket 1 month sub to grab a dataset, think is 30 years all stocks for like $30, removes survivorship bias. Anyone used it?
Data bento. They give you $180 in credits which is plenty for downloading OHLC data. You could get years of 1s candles for ES, NQ, and others, without going over this limit
You're not going to get this data for free. 

You can get OHLC data from most brokerages including Tradier. You can also use Yahoo Finance *provided its not for commercial usage*. 

If you want intraday data, you can use Polygon. 

For fundamental data, you can use SimFin for really cheap.
A little unconventional, but I write my algos in EasyLanguage and backtest them using the Tradstation platform. It‚Äôs free if you have an account with Tradestation
Love the thread. For crypto Binance's API is quite good and free data but you need an account and it's restricted in a lot of countries.
For crypto data, I use Binance, which can be used as market data provider without a verification of account. I am not sure if you even need an account to get data. Last I check it was free use
I'm not an algo trader but use SierraChart.

They have this for your consideration https://www.sierrachart.com/index.php?page=doc/SierraChartHistoricalData.php
For me FMP and norgate data cover everything I need for equities and are very good value for money
Thanks for summarizing the suggestions!
I use Polygon for 1 minute ticks and it has good options chains too
What do you guys think the best provider of international equity intraday data is?
A bit of a cheap hack, but you can export data from NinjaTrader easily.

A little bit of C# (can share my script if you want it) as a "Strategy" can export OHLC data on the chart, probably other stuff too.

I used it to export about 12 months of 1s futures chart data to CSV for free.

Not sure what the easiest way to get a Ninja license is, I got mine by signing up for a Apex Trader Funding prop firm challenge account for like $20-30 bucks on a sale, probably other ways to get a cheap license too.
Commenting so I can come back

Also I use Alpaca that I‚Äôm integrating with
Dukascopy for me has been very helpful for ML training since it's free, relatively easy to use, and the downside of missing data in places can be handled if you have a basic data cleaning pipeline set up. Some data is better than no data at all, and the data they have is high volume and therefore high quality (for the instruments I've used it for like Nasdaq 100).

For crypto only, Binance (again, free and high quality).

For actual backtesting I use cTrader, which provides actual tick data for free so the backtesting is highly accurate. The broker I use right now is ICMarkets which is relatively high volume.

The rest I'll need to check out! Threads like these are genuinely helpful.
I wonder how you guys think about OptionAlpha? They have a platform for you to do backtesting without coding. First 30 days is free and then it's quite expensive. I am kind of interested in exploring but want to know first hand experiences.
Thanks everyone for the positive feedback. Ping me if there's anything I can do to help.
I actually got the bulk of my data from IEX TOPS, parsed and processed it on my machine. This has a three main advantages:

1. It's completely free
2. I store it locally (on QuestDB) for faster execution and more control
3. It allows me to collect more data besides trade OHLC, e.g., bid/ask spread, logarithmic mean, standard deviation, etc... Such data may help me model a more realistic market simulator for backtesting.

Furthermore, I plan to combine it with more data, e.g. from https://stooq.com and SimFin.
Good post about backtesting data.
ccxt
If you create an Alpaca account by putting in $1, it has free historical SIP data (must be older than 15min) with 200/min calls. But you can batch symbols and get a ton in one call.
No yfinance? üòî
I‚Äôm so surprised barchart for excel has not been mentioned yet. All the historical data you could need and options history
Can we also divide the list your pulled together into ‚Äòfree‚Äô, ‚Äòfreemium‚Äô and ‚Äòpaid‚Äô data sources ?
alpaca, yfinance
For Binance data https://github.com/ocignis/tradezap
Which do you suggest for historical intraday charts (M1,M5,M15) for US Stocks?
[www.kibot.com](http://www.kibot.com)

They are reasonably priced.
CQG
A bit expensive probably, but I would add Bloomberg as an excellent source for market data, although intraday price data is clearly lacking.
i use Yahoo Finance
What about Alpaca? it does provide a historical data for free
I really liked Finnhub
Would love to see a the difference between stocks and options data sources.
Economic data: [Observer Desktop](https://vyntix.com/Downloads)

Disclaimer - I wrote it.
For stocks, I use YFinance.

For crypto, depending on the bot, I use the platform's API. For example, if I am deploying a bot for Binance, I will use the Binance API to fetch prices. But the engine I use (ZapCLI) automatically downloads the data for me so I don't have to do it manualy.
I use the free version of MarketStack right now, but it only gives you 1 year of data. You have to pay for more.
Are there any APIs with intraday sentiment analysis?
I actually use Oanda but I'm starting to think it's not so good
Intrinio, Benzinga

intrinio is a bit pricey, but the data quality is worth it. FMP-like data has too much wrong data.
This list is missing the data that's available from the Nasdaq Data marketplace, within which there are a number of quality vendors selling a wide array of data.
[deleted]
FMP
Mt5 export broker data
Surprised no one mentioned QuantConnect.  You can't download/export data, but even on their free tier I've been able to backtest on tick data, using their cloud framework.
Theta Data
TickStory is pretty good too. The data is from Dukascopy.
[removed]
Has anyone found issues with Polygon's trade and quote data?
I'm curious if anyone here uses EDGAR? Free and right from the source but my issue is that its not standardized..
Hi everyone! We're searching for beta testers for a new tool we're building that automates the execution of your trading strategies. If you are interested join us¬†[https://forms.gle/uSPdtNNgQNPpzAxH7](https://forms.gle/uSPdtNNgQNPpzAxH7)
Out of the API's you have listed here -  which one did you go with?
How reliable is alpaca?
I suggest you take MarketStack off your list. They are a fraudulent service wrapped in a nice packaging. I paid for their monthly subscription and used it only once but turned off autopay since their data wasn't good. Then they tried to still charge me automatically for the next month on the premise that they hide a line in the Term and Conditions that says you need to notify them 30 days in advance that you want to cancel.
From the streets
Iqfeed
I don't. 

I use bootstrapping models based on Bayesian Inference and use synthetic correlated assets and input priors I believe could happen.

I check if my posterior is theorem proof like Pythagoras and it can be thrown in a monte carlo simulation. 

I don't pay for data. 

Because if I do, by definition I need two (as one always has a mistake) - and need to build a reconciliation report between the two as well.

The worst is Bloomberg. By a million miles. The times when I was young in GS doing m&a and saw some intern take data out of Bloomberg as given, was, frequently being fired on the spot. 

I try to sample out of Dirichlet distributions, and do bootstraps on synthetic correlated assets to obtain data as much as needed. All free.
Do you need an account with them? Do they offer intraday, tick maybe even level II data?
Cool, thanks! :) Do you know if a solo developer can get access to their Developer API?

  
And also, it looks like FirstRate data and Csi data have somewhat older UI appearances which is totally fine. Do you think they provide higher quality data, e.g. less missing data points etc ? I guess quality of the data could be another factor but this is even harder to gauge, other than talking to people and listening to their opinions on this.
Man those are disgustingly expensive, nah polygon has them all pretty much beat on price or better yet your broker if they offer it free.
Looks extensive, maybe a bit pricey but on a first glance it looks like they put in effort to provide high quality data?

  
Also, I tend to agree with you on the second part. The longer the timeframe the more likely you are to find a profitable strategy just because buy and hold wins long term if diversified properly.
Let's say I'm fine with not performing walk forward optimization once I have come up with a strategy, so I'm just gonna subscribe to Norgate only once. Is there a way to export all the data to ascii format and store it locally while my subscription is active? I don't see that this can be done using RealTest, so is it doable using Norgate's software?
I would say the opposite.  What's the point of an algo for longer timeframes?  Might as well buy and hold.
I'm currently using their data, so I'm curious. The duplicate entries you mention, is that in the tick level data?
Oh wow, this is really cool, i already liked DukaScopy. It is awesome that someone put that together as a JSNode repo! Thanks for sharing
Of course! Great to see this may be helpful to other people :)
Very cool! They even have an Api for historical and live data feeds, thanks for sharing ü§ó
I second databento
Has looking into L2 data been any helpful for you?
Sorry you need to sub to quantrocket also to get this so becomes much more expensive - thought could buy standalone! sharadar/nasdaq is approx $50 for survivor free end of day equity data back to 1998. Think start with yahoo, if strat looks good with slippage/fees and enter on next open to avoid gaps then get point-in-time data to get more realistic historic view. databento looks awesome at such low cost for end of day point-in-time, 2017 onwards - even 1 minute data. Only if you really want/need to go further back in time is worth paying more I'd say. 2017+ suvivor free could plenty after a yahoo initial test with more. Think I'm rambling now, have a good day all.
Interesting, that is really helpful information
Never heard of SimFin. After a quick glance it looks interesting. Thanks for sharing! :)
Yahoo Finance has really poor quality data. I tried it and you'll *consistently* run across wild candles. You simply can't use it for anything non-trivial.
is fundamental data quality Okay?, I've seen many situations where the data is parsed improperly and I wonder what it's like with simfin.
Nice, that is mostly for futures trading, correct?
Thanks sharing! That must be some high quality data there
Of course! :) the list keeps growing and im glad to find new options and data providers. I would love to have an measure for which data is conisdered to be high quality but this seems to be rather difficult
Maybe the Interactive Brokers API can provide a lot on that end? Not sure if its free though.

https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/trading/ib-api.php
Little update on this - it seems more inconsistent than I thought.

At one point (about 12-6 months ago), I had been downloading historical data for ES and NQ every week for the market replay function.

Yesterday, went back to export NQ - let me load 1s data back to about June 18th, 2023 without a problem as normal. No idea why I can't load older data.

Then tried to load ES 1s data; could let me look back more than 12 months.

I'm guessing there's some kind of local cache going on, although I thought mine had been wiped.

Still, its worth taking a look - you can probably get a large chunk of data for free no matter what's actually going on.

Also worth mentioning - Databento offers $125 in free credits. With those, I was able to pick up about 2 years of 1s data for NQ for free.
What is your opinion on the quality of the data that is provided by through this approach? I think I remember there where ways to do the same with Prop Trading accounts on MetaTrader5 for manually exporting into a cvs file for all the data one could load into the screen or so.
Never heard of it but also interested in this. It looks like Option Alpha is for free if connected to TradeStation or Tradier Brokerage.
DataBento joins the chat, awesome üôå
I need to add a credit card to create a free account to view sample data. Nahhhhh.
Thanks :)
This looks like it mainly provides crypto data across all exchanges? That is actually a really impressive feat... Too bad the commercial financial markets are not capable to supply this in such an easy to retrieve manner. Unbelievable. That shows that if you really want to things can get done.
Fixed :)
Good point, that's nice they provide options chains like that
They are so fragmented into different data types, markets, prices, and business models that it's hard to do that but there is certainly a trend where some of them provide more free data compared to others. Other than price it would make sense to sort them according to how 'easy' it is to get the data and how long it takes and whether things work out of the box. If for example it takes me 10mins to set up a pipeline to download data or call a python library then I would gladly pay a little more then having to setup code to fetch data from the api and make sure not packets get lost etc.
Thanks for sharing :)
Are you looking for quality, cheap, or easily accessible data? With gui or via scripting? There are many approaches here
Very cool, Thanks for sharing, although Im not sure I would call them reasonably priced... At least not compared to the above data providers. Are you comparing them to other even more expensive data providers?
I'm having a hard time finding pricing information online. Do you know how much they charge?
Thanks for mentioning Bloomberg, will have to check them out. If intraday data is lacking then that means they only provide end-of-day data? These days end-of day data is most readily available for free, so not sure it is worth to pay for that.
Added :)
Thanks for sharing this with us! :)
Don't pay them!! RUN!! I made the mistake to use the $9.99 because I wanted intraday data. Big mistake because I could only get 15 min data and it lacked integrity. After that I chose not to use it again but there are still try charge me for the second month, claiming I was supposed to notify them 30 days prior that I wanted to cancel the monthly subscription.
Interested in this as well if anyone has any recommendations
So far I've been using Alpha Vantage but their sentiment only goes back to 2022.
Well, good that there is a summary of resources not too far away :D
Do you scrape Benzinga or use their official API?
Lets me check them out!
Wow that is really disturbung... Thats simply really bad... I think someonebelse raised concerns on that end as well
Oh wow, this is really cool, is reasonably priced, and has a ton of interesting endpoints other than just candlestick data. Very cool, thanks for sharing!
That's a good point, I guess the Cloud Research option on QuantConnect allows to do Data Analysis on historical data. That is pretty cool. I was not aware of that. Thanks for sharing!
Reallt cool work TickStory that is!
Damn... I hate when they do that? How long is your subscription running now?
... the streets of New York?
Seems like I need to chat with IQFeed customer service to receive quotes for their product. Is it expensive?
Yeah you have to open up an account with them. I used them for daily OHLCV. I‚Äôm on mobile right now so this is just based on memory but the parameters you pass in to get the historical data I believe have a spot for period and frequency. They acquired TDAmeritrade recently and basically brought their API over to Schwab with some slight modifications. You have to make a developer account with Schwab (separate from your trading account) in order to view the API documentation. But if you wanted to get a feel for what the API is like, the TD Ameritrade docs are still up for now. 

https://apiforums.tdameritrade.com/price-history/apis/get/marketdata/%7Bsymbol%7D/pricehistory

And here is the link to Schwab‚Äôs api

https://developer.schwab.com

To answer your other questions, I‚Äôve never tried to get the level II data. I‚Äôve heard you used to be able to on TD Ameritrade but I haven‚Äôt needed it with my strategies. Option data should be supported.
Databento has fantastic Python support, both for live and historic data. Supports other languages too. It's totally worth the money. They usually offer $150 of credits for new accounts, which if you use for 1-minute or slower OHLC will allow you to kick the tires sufficiently.

Firstratedata provides csv download. It's about a 100 lines of code to automate the process.

CSI data doesn't have a reasonable API, but they provide a windows app to download the data (into csvs). One can automate it to some degree.

From my experience, all these data sources are of high quality.
Think it depends on the data you're after, if you select the basic stock bundle and ohlcv daily or even 1m it looks pretty low cost, and the fact it has delisted stocks is a massive plus, for me anyway. Will post back when I've got it and see what it's like.
Yeah it's pretty much the gold standard now used by a bunch of well known systematic traders.

Eg Cesar Alvarez, Nick Radge, Andreas Clenow, Marsten Parker.

The guy who runs it is a super friendly guy too, always happy to chat on discord or forums to help with any data questions.

I use RealTest with it to trade from it, and test of course. Integration is seamless and all the included systems that come with the software work with it out of the box.
Yes go tools->export task manager and it can create CSVs
>What's the point of an algo for longer timeframes?¬†

You said the inverse of the answer in your last sentence - "buy and hold". The point is because systematic trading using daily or weekly bars outperforms buy and hold. Even using monthly bars outperforms buy and hold. In particular, it can avoid the big drawdowns that buy and hold gives you.

If your interested for real, I'll post some backtests of my momentum and trend systems just let me know.

Also for longer timeframes, it doesn't have to be THAT long - I trade a weekly swing that buys on Monday sells on Friday which uses weekly bars. You can even day trade using daily bars (buy or short on open, sell with MOC order). Or you can do something in between.

Algo doesn't care about timeframe, but retail commission costs and slippage does.
No, I don't have access to tick data, hopefully that one is ok, I would assume realtime data is also ok since it should come directly from the SIP. The most concerning thing to me that I've found so far is in the stock splits, which for a few stocks are not correct, and then the entire adjusted ohlcv aggregate is computed in the wrong way because of it. It's just a lot of data sanity checks and debugging that I have to do to make sure something isn't majorly off with historical candles, and you'd expect they would do it for you in the first place. I briefly looked at the dividend data and it looks like there might be some issues there too, although that's less important to me. I can't speak for their realtime offerings or for other products, they seem ok at first glance. Nobody is perfect, but I'm gonna try other options for historical data (did not find the same errors with the splits with FMP for instance)
Happy journey bro!
Do they have ES historical OHLC? Since when?
Does DataBento end up being pricey for you? 

  
Edit: I do like the price estimate calculator they provide. That's a nice heads up for expected costs, especially across different timeframes etc
I use it for stocks
It is free up to 1minute candies, for exchanges in your own country. Pay extra for other exchanges.
It seems just about accurate to the CME feed I see on TradingView; I haven't noticed any major discrepancies. I definitely find it satisfactory and usable for generating data for live trading, particularly for the price point (free).

The trade entry/stop/take profits of trade generated by the system, based on candle patterns (so extremely sensitive to any invalid OHLC data), have matched up with what I'd expect from the TV CME chart in tested cases (haven't tested 100% of cases).

Sometimes, there's a missing bar; since it's a 1s timeframe 1s, I just fill it in using the previous bar's data. Not 100% accurate but good enough.

Theoretically, that filling-in could introduce an unreliable piece of data once in a while if that was some enormous 1s bar that's missing... but that's quite rare. Usually any missing data is during electronic trading / slow hours.

Convenience factor is nice too; can load up around 60-90 days or so of 1s data in one screen, enable the strategy, a few seconds later its done spitting out the the CSV file (doesn't only export what's visible). (Way better than what I used to do with manually exporting chart data from TradingView - only what fits on a screen - that took forever to get 1s data for a long time range and was very error-prone).

Main limitation is I can't seem to get it to show me 1s data past about a year, which means my backtests are very limited. You might be able to see back a lot further if you were using, say, 1m bars.   
  
(If anyone knows where to find older 1s data, let me know pleeease!)
‚ù§Ô∏è
Sample data is actually available on the dataset detail pages without signup.

The instrument-specific detail pages have the old signup wall and that‚Äôs an artifact of the past when we didn‚Äôt have any signup button on our homepage so we had to put it somewhere. We didn‚Äôt bother removing this wall because it‚Äôs being removed with the next refactor of our site - you can even disable it from the browser actually.

Regardless, signup is free in spite of card info. We did give much thought to how we can avoid asking for card info upfront, but (a) deferring that means we have to design a much more complex UI because the user portal will need many additional states, like a user that doesn‚Äôt have payment info and tries to pay exchange license fees and (b) having no card requirement makes it easy for fraudulent users to create many burner accounts and from what we‚Äôve seen, those users indiscriminately hammer the API and make the experience worse for our legitimate users.

It may not be for you now but I hope you‚Äôll give us a try some day!
In hindsight, you might be right. I used them for futures and I only had specific needs, like VIX every half hour or EOD. To get that at firstrate data, it's $100. Additionally you would only get VIX but you get 1-minute, 5-minute, 30-minute, 1-hour, and 1-day timeframes. At kibot It'd be $100 but you get 30m timeframe continuous contract for all Futures.
Case by case, use internal, maybe it would be okay to scrape
[https://data.nasdaq.com/search](https://data.nasdaq.com/search)
Yeah for sure. I think it‚Äôs the best financial data resource.
Polygon is best value for money. Idk any cheap futures data. My best recommendation is to go for crypto. The traditional market is way too competitive for retail traders in directional stock trading
Thanks! :) It looks like 1min candles are supported but no ticks, at least not on that endpoint. Should do a deeper dive into that Api, its free data after all. Im curious to see how far back ond can go on these tickers etc
Back in the day think or swim was one of the early movers in publishing an api for stock and option investors. That was quite a while ago, but they used to make l2 data available. I just started looking at my Schwab account again and decided to start using it again.
Thanks for sharing, the python support is great, I need to check if this is a library or API interface
Thanks for sharing this so much. Thats a great resource to have!  From what I was reading you are placing the trades manually, is this correct?
I should have said buy and hold an index fund.  It seems commonly held that index funds outperform stock picking or trying to time the market.  And even if you eek out an advantage over the S&P, you lose out on tax advantages of long term holds.  If that's wrong I'd love to see/hear how.
Thank you! I'll keep an eye out for that :) If you happen to remember any stock where you found an error, then please let me know. I could look into it also. Maybe they've corrected it since then, but just in case they haven't...

I'll also be a bit more critical of the data
Thank you! :) at the moment i am pretty much at an explorative stage and im just looking to explore and understand a little bit more of how things work and operate. For some reason i have this feeling that inddicator based data analysis is probably not the way to go but what else should we do with all this available data ü´†
We have ES historical OHLC since 2017 at the moment.

We're also about to extend this back to 2010 as per [this feature ticket](https://roadmap.databento.com/b/n0o5prm6/feature-ideas/backfill-cme-globex-data-to-jan-2009)‚Äîbut the additional history will only be available to enterprise users.
If you use python and the tools Bento offers, you only really need to download specifically the options/times/frequencies you need.  I.e. No need to pay for high detail records of an option that is 200 points OTM for 0 DTE for instance.   
At any rate, I second Bento and their support team is great.
Also the blokes on their support are very switched on and helpful. I‚Äôve had issues with their API in the past and they were able to send me some tailored python code to fix my issues.
Yeah the calculator is helpful, I believe you also get like a $125 credit on opening an account which covers a lot of data
Update on this:

TL;DR: Ninja data on 1s timeframes (at least) seems inconsistent with itself at times, and very inconsistent with Databento.

Recently grabbed some 1s data from Databento.

It disagrees, quite significantly, with NinjaTrader.

I'm not sure which one is the "correct" one, but I'd lean toward Databento being the correct one (if anyone knows otherwise, let me know!)

Almost every 1s candle, when comparing Databento's data with Ninjatrader's, is off by at least a tick on the open, high, low, or close.

In most cases, it's off by a couple of ticks on a couple of the properties.

In some cases, it's off by over a handle.

This may or may not be too significant if you're testing a strategy on, say, a 5m chart.

I'm testing scalping strategies on a 1s chart where every tick is incredibly important (stops and take profits are often within a few handles of each other), so won't be using NinjaTrader anymore.

Also encountered issues recently with NinjaTrader reporting different values for the same segment of time. After hitting "Reload historical data" on the chart, I'll end up with different values. Not always, but sometimes, and not sure why.

Volume also doesn't match.

Not sure if this affects real-time data or not, although I don't trade with Ninja anymore since I noticed some significant lags and differences in the feed it displays vs. TradingView at times.

From what I can tell, Databento is using Globex as its source, and so is Ninja's historical data, so I'm not sure why there's a discrepancy.

It's only about $5 to download a month's worth of 1s OHLC-V data for NQ from Databento, so that seems like a safer and more affordable option.
Thanks for sharing, added!
Here's the docs to one of the wrappers for the Schwab API.  Doesn't look like it has tick data unfortunately.  [https://schwab-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/client.html#price-history](https://schwab-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/client.html#price-history)
No, realtest generates the orders for me (I still need to push the button though, and it's end of day or pre-open). 

Marsten provides an app called OrderClerk that integrates between RealTest and IBKR, so when you run your strategy in RealTest it knows what positions you have already. Then it works well to generate closing orders for long term things like trend following strategies.

For short term mean reversion, I have it place MOC or LOC orders with "good after" times up front for the Friday for eg a weekly strategy.

It can also do IBKR Basket trader, or a CSV based on that.

Seamless if IBKR, otherwise you might need your own API to read the CSVs to your broker.

Honestly I had no idea about the order capability, the naming as "RealTest" really threw me off and I initially tried Sierra chart. Thankfully I came around and tried RealTest it's so easy now.
>I should have said buy and hold an index fund.

Sure, but that's what I assumed you meant in the first post.

Systematic trading outperforms it, even taking into account slippage, and commissions. Taxes are individual, but one can use a tax efficient account if it's a long term strategy.

Here's two examples, run on two universes (Australian stock market, and then the Russell 1000). 

This was one of the worst periods in the test for the Russell by the way, the long term result of the system 1993 to 2024 is around 17.8% for the Russell stocks, and 27% on the ASX. But shorter term tests are easier to visualise.

Notice the bear market periods the system goes flat.

The test doesn't take into account what you do with cash during bear years, if you buy gold or bonds, then you can ad a few more percent on top of that. Or you can earn interestd.

I plan to add rotational aspects for bear markets so that I do add a mix of gold or bonds, just need more time to work on things.

Higher priority is to finish all my systems so that they overlap well and don't correlate too much.

That‚Äôs a question for you to answer based on your trading style. There is no one way to do EDA. You can find pattern, anomalies, you can analyze it as a strictly time series data, check correlations, order book, market profile and the list goes on.
Ah, I see, thanks for bringing this up. This makes sense.
Hey u/TPCharts, given the frequency of mismatch you‚Äôve described, it sounds to me that the issue you‚Äôve described is likely that there‚Äôs some kind of continuous contract roll adjustment being applied on NT‚Äôs data. We don‚Äôt ever apply roll adjustments to our data.

Another type of issue that may arise is that we extract our data from MBO, which is technically more accurate treatment of book depth for signal calculation and leaves the implied depth calculation to the client side, whereas we find that NT (CQG?) uses MBP which includes the implied depth. This, however, only affects apparent book depth at top 2 levels and shouldn‚Äôt affect trade prints that affect OHLCV.

One other type of mismatch you may come across, not present here, is that many vendors don‚Äôt calculate the daily OHLCV from tick data, which differs from the official settlement OHLCV published by CME which has a manual element to it and differs from the pricing and volume on the tick data. We publish both, and the official settlement values are in the statistics schema instead of the OHLCV schema.

One last possibility I can think of is to check if NT prints their OHLCVs with highest bid or lowest ask when no trade occurs. Some feeds do that. We only use the trades strictly for consistency.

Otherwise yes, our feed is just constructed from CME‚Äôs raw multicast feed, which is the ultimate source of truth, and we publish the sequence number so you can see that we didn‚Äôt lose any packets. You can further cross-check that our tick data and MBO data has consistency with our 1s OHLCVs.
Thanks!  I'll investigate this more.  Do you run all of your long term investments this way or still do some traditional buy and hold?  Any general details on the strategy you can share?
Wow, thank you for the detailed explanation! I appreciate it üëç
You‚Äôre very welcome. Thanks for being a customer!
Please put down your knives
Yes, I too am tired of all the fake gurus, all the scammers, all the course/indicator/strategy sellers, and all the wannabes that claim infeasible performance strats.

Yes, every time I read that someone made 10% in 1 month, I too think that they just got lucky and there's no way it's sustainable.

It's right to be skeptical of everything - I get it.

-- --


But please put down your knives.

Every time a real algotrader on this sub discovers a little edge, feel happy and proud, and try to share their little joy in this sub, they get attacked to oblivion.

All they're trying to do is share their happiness, bounce off ideas, get a healthy discussion and perhaps learn something new.

Instead, all they end up doing is defending themselves while trying to explain that they're not claiming to have found the holy grail.

Chill out guys - let's at least try to make this a calm and rational place where people can have healthy discussions. Please put down your knives.

Thanks :)
Yup, this is another side of trading that is seldom talked about: the over-skepticism.

‚ÄúIt works until it doesnt‚Äù

‚ÄúCongrats you will be a billionaire in 5 years‚Äù

‚ÄúYou got lucky‚Äù

‚ÄúThe past 5 years was a bull market, anyone who went long would have been profitable‚Äù

‚ÄúThere are big institutions who spent millions in infrastructure and hiring the best PhDs in the world, retail traders like you dont stand a chance‚Äù

These people are just parroting generalized statements with no constructive criticisms about the strategy posted by OP. Pointless really.
It's all in our hands. Let's downvote unhealthy criticism or hateful comments
How could someone introduce something without being grilled? What are you‚Äôre suggestions?
It doesn't make sense for someone to post on Reddit about their profitable strategy. If they eventually start making money, they'll disappear from Reddit.

People who post about it have something to gain by sharing it.
Spot on homie. 

I'm 3 years in and >2M tx/year.. and 4-5 users on this sub ate me alive last time I tried to post that I ended up deleting it.

Like, I wouldn't call myself JS yet, but at the same time I had tried to bring some stories from the field, and got a similar slap.

Heck even below someone has a pitchfork out against me for no reason. My deleted post: https://imgur.com/a/qC2zRNV had no shills in it.. but damn some people are toxic.
Take this post for example - https://old.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/1ga5wbp/you_should_never_test_in_production/

Dude just shared his personal experience, and even himiself admitted that his strat doesn't really scale

> *It has literally been side pocket money. It is not a proper machine that can even take all of my capital, lol. I could probably make more cash, in absolute terms, running a sausage sizzle each weekend ü§£ü§£.*

But the comment section is trying to rip him a new one with shit like *"this Australian scammer"* and *"76% a month would turn 20k into 15 billion in just 2 years"*.


Chill out guys.
Can i keep my gigantic fork?

I will usually say "give up" to people who try to rehabilitate the internet. But maybe i hope this sub can do better.
I wrote a post sharing my joy and excitement of having found an edge in two separate occassions--before 2020 and during the early cv19 era. In both times, I was treated with positivity, with only a few expressing criticism. I was approached by many via pm asking me to share more.

I've also seen many other posts by others that were mostly responded with positive messages over the years.

The general reactions depend on what you share. If you share the result of obviously flawed backtest or ideas that are obviously not gonna work but you enthusiastically write like you've found a real edge, you tend to be met with generally negative responses, and understandably so.

Over time, I have learned to neither share about my progress nor respond to posts sharing about a potential edge one has discovered whether the edge is likely to actually exist or is likely just a result of flawed testing--as I realized I do not get anything out of it by doing so. (edit: typos)
Unfortunately the people you are targeting with this message, will either not read your text, or not apply it if they read it. 

It is obviously evil to scam, but the issue doesn‚Äôt only stem from scammers, it also come from the scammed.

There is no scammer if there is no room for a scammed to exist. These scams work because many people believe in them and get tricked. It‚Äôs an arbitrage on illiteracy/naiveness/agreeableness and few other features including ‚Äúdesire for quick wealth‚Äù
Because the ones who know, know. Trading in itself is a pipedream sold to the masses to steal your money. You can‚Äôt predict price movements that‚Äôs just the truth. No algo or strategy you have will give you consistent returns enough to make you rich over time, that is just the reality.

You can make money from trading but it has to be based on the fact that it‚Äôs all random and unpredictable, so you just capture the outliers and keep your losses small. That‚Äôs also another thing, in order to win you need to lose, everyone is fixated on just being right and having control, when in reality you have no control over anything. No pattern or behaviour you find yourself being infatuated with is going to make you rich. There is no edge, there no control, there is no secret. This is how I started profiting consistently once I let go and accepted it. No prediction no control.
When I posted an idea and did not get flamed I knew I was onto something! ;)
Ya it‚Äôs a though space. Literally posted my whole setup with my live account that had made 6 figures and the mods removed the post after 100+ comments. So much for trying to share experiences.
It happened to me the other day.

The main "critic" was someone who never contributes to the sub, but is heavy into DnD, and Pokemon.

Yesterday I posted a sensitivity analysis on the same idea, and the main "critic" was one with an ad hominem along the lines  of "It's not what you say, it's how you say it, and you are breaking rule #2" and blocked me immediately so I could not respond, so he got the top comment for some reason.

Since there is no 100% novel idea on Wall Street, when people see something similar to what they are doing, they are feeling seen and are desperate in disparaging the idea and the author, hoping that "their edge will persist" and no one will start trading in this way. Then there are real trolls who will do shit for giggles, a lot of clueless lurkers, and finally there are the scammers,

So if you post, know that you will get brought down by the combined negativity of all these groups of people.

I have since deleted my posts and no longer plan on posting.

Love r/algotrading, keep on keeping on.
Yeah such an issue with the internet. People just trying to prove they're cool and smart by being rude
One of the things I dislike about this hobby is that there doesn‚Äôt seem to be anyplace with a good community that wants to talk shop.

It seems like it‚Äôs always either super negative, scammy get rich quick types, or just completely dead.
Some people are pro athletes and some are not. I know someone who turned 1K into over 2m+. Lot's of luck but the first 100k wasn't really.
Agreed. There's a lot of good that happens here and I'm extremely grateful for all I've learned and all the help I've received, but, without talking about any specific posts, there is also a negative vibe in general that I don't think helps anyone.
I get your perspective OP. But, the thing is, it might attract certain sarcasms fro sure, but he/she would get lots of blind areas addressed and if it were upto me, I'd want people to hurt my ego than my algo hurting my account.
Well. If you look at it, it's better for the trader to get a reality check here before they lose their money. Worst case, they validate themselves and leaves with more confidence then they came with.


¬† Otherwise they see the error of their process by getting peer reviewed and save themselves grief and financial loss.¬† Doing it the hard way is the right way.¬†


If you cannot survive the scrutiny of the question, maybe you are not ready to put your money in it.
i really want to make a post to this sub one day. the information I've gathered from here has helped me tremendously in building my trading bot. even if it's just a 'thank you' post to everyone for offering their advice.
Why would anyone share their successful strategy? It will only lead to more competition if many people know it quickly and you won't get any returns. It's like giving away your business strategy to your competition. 

Only ones who sell are the ones who wants to make money by selling courses saying that they are profitable,  or who think their strategy won't yield consistent returns in future.

Happy to know I'm wrong if you have any rational reason.
I‚Äôve seen that happen a lot. People respond with comments like ‚Äúscammer‚Äù or ‚Äúfake results.‚Äù Many are unhappy and envious, unable to accept that someone has managed to develop a successful algorithm. Creating an algorithm with an edge is no easy task, especially one that outperforms most traders. It takes years of hard work and experience. Unfortunately, that‚Äôs just how people are, not just here but in other communities too. Instead, we should congratulate them and use it as motivation to improve our own trading. Take my experience, for example. This guy, jerry_farmer, shared his algo trading results, and he‚Äôs really killing it. At the time, my algo was making about 4.5% per month with a maximum drawdown of -4%, while his was doing 5-10% with a max drawdown of -3%. I replied, expressing how impressed I was. I wasn‚Äôt angry at him, but at myself for being too comfortable and not pushing harder to improve my algo. I didn‚Äôt sleep for a couple of nights until I figured things out, and now my algo is performing much better. I‚Äôm extremely proud of the results I‚Äôm getting now.
I think you are overfitting
There Are algos out there which Work since decades and are really simple.
For example the buy thursday sell friday evening gold rush strategy. Or that us markets rise at the end of month.
Tuesday turnaround.
Simple strategies that Work, well known and everyone can use it.

Algos dont need to be complicated. U dont need that single edge that no others have to make Money.

And also simple EMA strategies could Work very well in higher time frames.
They dont generate signals every day but thats ok.
I built some trading indicators for myself and then tried to sell and was harassed. I didn‚Äôt promise anything, just offered tools that help to automate market analysis. I use them everyday in my analysis. I offered free trial so that people could try. Put a ton of work in building these indicators but people want everything free and don‚Äôt want to think but have a button to they click to get rich. To be a good carpenter one need to master different skills but tools help optimize work processes. I agree when people sell promises without any proof it is bad. But some people sell some knowledge that reduce your time learning some stuff. So you pay for optimization. A person need to think critically. I purchased few tutorials in trading. I didn‚Äôt become rich but I got exposed to things I was not aware before. Indicators are just tools. Would a carpenter say that about a hammer.
Anyone making 10% a month ‚Ä¶ every month‚Ä¶. Would have more money than Elon.  Blackrock would buy it for all the monies.
It‚Äôs really not the +10% in 1 month success that people are skeptical over, it‚Äôs the aftermath. 
If said system returns -10% the next month and +10% after that, then repeats pattern over the rest of the year. 

You get a -5.9% result independent of funding cost. 

This is why we all should be skeptical of one time results. 
Give us how many trades over a few years in combination. 
That‚Äôs a real portfolio for evaluating. ü§î
‚ÄºÔ∏èThank you, I‚Äôve never felt more attacked than on Reddit for just simply sharing my strategies. Not only do I provide skeptics with a trial so they verify but ai also link to so many different resources and logs and proof. But nobody checks they even physically threaten me üòÇüòÇüòÇ. Cant blame them for their initial reaction considering how many copy-pasted scam strategies there are, but nobody bothers to even look at my website trustpilot discord etc‚Ä¶ I meam come on it takes a minute and something like 10/20% a month isn‚Äôt ijf

Yeah I deleted my past comments here.  I have a successful algo, posted some stats about it in one of those "how is everyone doing" threads, and was bombarded for days by a mix of people in my replies and DMs who were either super angry for no reason or begging for handouts.  There were maybe two people who were there to talk shop.
Facts
Agreed if you don‚Äôt like it downvote it
Maybe just accept that this is internet where grilling will be forever. And simply ignore worthless grillings?
I actually tried this before, just wanted to share what I'd found in case it could help somebody. Wasn't looking for anything in return, but man....it elicited lots of hateful comments. 

So why share if no one wants it? I'm still trying to share it....but not on Reddit anymore, it's just a wasteland of negativity. 

And this is what we're feeding into our AI models. If our future AI overlords are extremely negative and hateful it'll be because we trained them to be so.
True. Those who got no strategy (no Alpha/Edge) post details/info and those who actually got the real thing would be a moron to talk about it.

Make sense people are salty and sceptical as less than 5% will get anywhere with trading in general, including algo trading and systematic trading.
Is this really true? SSRN.com is full of academics posting profitable strategies. You can post about replicating or tweaking these strategies if they are profitable. I enjoy reading about data driven strategies that are based on academic research.
you were shilling your signal service and Discord though
I like your home lab setup
all i can say you did well Sir...huh why sir because you earned my respect you worked hard and achieved that i never could.
I mean: Every time someone posts something like this WHILE ADVERTISING A PAID COURSE IN HIS PROFILE THAT COSTS THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS, it leaves a very weird and sour taste in my mouth.

You know as well as i do that this was intentional product placement.
I think you are right about the point about "low capacity" returns though. That is a frequent misunderstanding about the nature of what returns are possible or not.

But my bigger point still stands. Such courses are almost always content with public knowledge and not wort thousands... it is a borderline scam imo.
I could of not said it better.
I agree with what you're saying, but how do you consistently win ie more than you lose over a long period of time? Learning to identify the outliers and risk management basically?
Would you like to share it again with me? 
If you're not okay with it, I don't want the full setup but general idea of what was the setup (what it aims, breakouts/reversal)
 what kind of tools/indicators you used
What was his medium? Options?
More details pls, it was in options.?
Eagerly waiting for your post :)
If you're selling your indicator, then it is simply useless. If it was useful, you would be using it yourself.

Anyone trying to sell a trading course/indicator/strategy is basically a scammer.
You're clearly selling starts on your website. Maybe you can start by not scamming people in the first place?


Why would you sell your strategies if they make 20% a month?
Do you have a stick up your ass? Everything said has to be condescending and attacking? You should be ashamed, disgusted, seeking therapy that you try to inflate your ego by pissing on people online.
lets face it those people who were angry or bagging were losers in the market, they cant figure it out.They like little regressed kids.They will never make it in fact if they knew what it takes to become profitable consistently...this aint a serious forum for discussion, some nuggets but this game wants ones blood unless we stumble on something hidden.
Wrong user? I don't partake in either
I totally agree! Anyone selling a trading course is pretty much certainly a scammer.

The issue is people shoot you down even though you're just trying to discuss and learn.
Catch the big moves that are happening in real time without any prediction, outliers. 

Example- enter everyday on SPY open 30 mins in enter direction of the market, perhaps open price as reference. Tight sl, hold till close. Results in ~25% wr and an average rr of 6, (which makes sense since when you look at the average daily returns % for spy since 1979, ~2500 days/11,000 have exceeded +-0.8%).
Maybe now you get it. 

Given the inherent randomness and Brownian motion of price movement, trying to predict is fundamentally impossible. All these people here will never achieve long term profitability because they want to try control the outcome of their trade. They think if they just find that price prediction strategy can work through every market condition they‚Äôll become rich. Reality is, if you‚Äôre not willing to lose, you‚Äôll never win, and they want strategies that win. If you want consistency, the only way for that to happen long term, is to not predict anything and to have tight risk management. Price prediction is an illusion. Aligning yourself with randomness isn‚Äôt. Direct exposure to volatility via CFDs/future derivatives is the most efficient way. Options maybe a hand ful per year but that‚Äôs it. (Options way have more complexity and factors that make the odds even worse for you, like the decay and expiration, gamma etc). They give roughly the same RRs anyway. 

End of the day if you don‚Äôt have privileged info the market doesn‚Äôt already have, you have nothing else to use aside from capture the asymmetric returns of equities via Volatility of the open (if day trading). Anything else is just a bad speculation based on no actual objective behaviour or analysis. (Unless you have intrinsic information that that market doesn‚Äôt)

That‚Äôs just my approach anyway, but it‚Äôs centred on reality and observed statistical analysis. As the saying goes, everything works until it doesn‚Äôt. This entire sub is delusion, just like all the other trading subs. They have no idea. Trying to seek certainty in uncertainty and they wonder why it never works out. I would know because I used to be the same.

Mostly asymmetrical trades found using [screeners](https://wealthbranch.com/leaf/strategies/)
But there is one genuine reason why someone would sell their trading indicator or bot: Raise trading capital. I myself lost a lot of money in the currency market trying to figure things out with algo trading. Out of 30 trading bots that I developed over the period of three years, only the last one proved to have an edge in the markets and made consistent profits. It uses simple statistical modeling. But by the time I figured it all out, I ran out of optimal trading capital and I had to sell licenses of my trading bot that very few people bought. I am kinda stuck now without sufficient capital for trading. But I get your point. Fake gurus and scammers have made it tough to trust people.
nope, definitely you.

You got called out so you had to delete, but you were definitely shilling the paid services.
Could you share now?
Thank you for explaining. Much appreciated
Using just shares? That‚Äôs a little hard to believe. Are you associated with WB?
Lmao delusional. You can‚Äôt scrape together $1k? What are the returns on your strategy?
Not on either side, but some proof would be welcome
My deleted post was in June about exchanges, nothing to do with signals.

You got your hate aimed at the wrong dude, that any of the archiving sites shows immediately my deleted posts weren't a shill
Not sure what's hard to believe, if you know how to trade. People would rather stay poor and lose money than learn or read. I can't help them. 

I love WB, I use to code pinescript. Don't really have to do much anymore after I learned how to use it.
I already have such small capital. May sound unbelievable, but around 35% returns per annum is what is possible, however if I manage to withdraw at the end of the year and use compounding (by letting the lot size grow as the account balance grows), I can make around 60% per annum. I have a lot of personal commitments and my source of income is irregular, hence I would need at least 10k dollars to make my life better. I stay away from taking loans (yes, I am risk averse. What if my strategy suddenly loses it's edge) and I avoid funded accounts (as most of them are scams). Hence decided to sell licences to my very own trading bot, but not much sales. Not going to blame anybody though. That's how life is üòÄ
That guy is a dickhead, disregard
You made a post 5 days ago that literally asks: ‚ÄúWhat are the best trading tips that actually work?‚Äù

I don‚Äôt buy that your friend turned 1k into 100k without luck, then proceeded to flip it into 2M with a little luck involved. Especially with just shares. I‚Äôm not even going to bother thinking about the % return, because it‚Äôs ludicrous. I can only assume you‚Äôre associated with WB and are shilling their services.
That's like you saying because you can't play a sport, pro athletes don't exist üò™

As far as I can tell wb is free ü§£
So are you in any way associated with wb? Are you the creator, do you know the creator, do you have any interest in promoting them at all? Or are you just a guy off the street who happened to come across them one day?
Collection of useful posts in this sub
This sub has over 1.7M users. Most users here are lurkers (like me), and a very large majority is people looking to get into algo trading. 

Only a tiny fraction of this sub's members have ever had an algorithm live in the market. Due to this, it is difficult to find good posts here.

The [top posts](https://old.reddit.com/r/algotrading/top/?sort=top&t=all) are unfortunately filled with memes and low quality stuff.

What other useful threads have you found?


PS: it's not about the post - it's the discussion that often contains the gold
I was just going to ask for nominations for a refreshed posting hall of fame list.... I'll review these but if you could give any reason why a given post stood out besides just being in the top post sort view of the sub...  I will consider said post.
I really liked this one:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/18r17fk/lessons\_learned\_one\_year\_after\_going\_live/](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/18r17fk/lessons_learned_one_year_after_going_live/) 

One of the key points in trading if algo or not is that you have to just go for it and go-live. The learning curve is much steeper if actual money (does not even need to be much) is involved from my point of view. Also you learn what spreads really do to your performance. A few years ago I tested minutely strategies on crypto. I found huge alpha (if our friend the market was perfect) but once including the tiniest spreads, the portfolio value went to zero in no time.
You are simply great ! I was lurking long time, of late stopped looking this sub (even reddit). You showed me how much I miss reading this blog. Started reading again.

Kudos to you.

Backtest results for Larry Connors ‚ÄúDouble 7‚Äù Strategy
I tested the ‚ÄúDouble 7‚Äù strategy popularised by Larry Connors in the book ‚ÄúShort Term Trading Strategies That Work‚Äù. It‚Äôs a pretty simple strategy with very few rules.



**Setup steps are:**

Entry conditions:

* Price closes above 200 day moving average
* Price closes at a 7 day low

If the conditions are met, the strategy enters on the close. However for my backtest, I am entering at the open of the next day.

* Exit if the price closes at a 7 day high



**Backtest**

To test this out I ran a backtest in python over 34 years of S&P500 data, from 1990 to 2024. The equity curve is quite smooth and steadily increases over the duration of the backtest.

https://preview.redd.it/xe3yo23uijud1.png?width=2079&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d9a9f928470ab89f0edf477f2ab677116ce4006

**Negatives**

To check for robustness, I tested a range of different look back periods from 2 to 10 and found that the annual return is relatively consistent but the drawdown varies a lot.

I believe this was because it doesn‚Äôt have a stop loss and when I tested it with 8 day periods instead of 7 days for entry and exit, it had a similar return but the drawdown was 2.5x as big. So it can get stuck in a losing trade for too long.

**Variations**

To overcome this, I tested a few different exit strategies to see how they affect the results:

* Add stop loss to exit trade if close is below 200 MA - This performed poorly compared to the original strategy
* Exit at the end of the same day - This also performed poorly
* Close above 5 day MA - This performed well and what‚Äôs more, it was consistent across different lookback periods, unlike the original strategy rules.
* Trailing stop - This was also good and performed similarly to the 5 MA close above.

Based on the above. I selected the ‚Äúclose above 5 day MA‚Äù as my exit strategy and this is the equity chart:

https://preview.redd.it/zftwwf0ijjud1.png?width=2079&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd8a6bd0090fdddf5e42937336bca3b293fe7318

**Results**

I used the modified strategy with the 5 MA close for the exit, while keeping the entry rules standard and this is the result compared to buy and hold. The annualised return wasn‚Äôt as good as buy and hold, but the time in the market was only \~18% so it‚Äôs understandable that it can‚Äôt generate as much. The drawdown was also pretty good.

It also has a decent winrate (74%) and relatively good R:R of 0.66.

https://preview.redd.it/db36u7iwijud1.png?width=758&format=png&auto=webp&s=1680e9dc6205c7fd725da246baa3034f5b3245ac

**Conclusion:**

It‚Äôs an interesting strategy, which should be quite easy to trade/automate and even though the book was published many years ago, it seems to continue producing good results. It doesn‚Äôt take a lot of trades though and as a result the annualised return isn‚Äôt great and doesn‚Äôt even beat buy and hold. But used in a basket of strategies, it may have potential. I didn‚Äôt test on lower time frames, but that could be another way of generating more trading opportunities.

**Caveats:**

There are some things I didn‚Äôt consider with my backtest:

1. The test was done on the S&P 500 index, which can‚Äôt be traded directly. There are many ways to trade it (ETF, Futures, CFD, etc.) each with their own pros/cons, therefore I did the test on the underlying index.
2. Trading fees - these will vary depending on how the trader chooses to trade the S&P500 index (as mentioned in point 1). So i didn‚Äôt model these and it‚Äôs up to each trader to account for their own expected fees.
3. Tax implications - These vary from country to country. Not considered in the backtest.

**Code**

The code for this backtest can be found on my github: [https://github.com/russs123/double7](https://github.com/russs123/double7)

**Video:**

I go into a lot more detail and explain the strategy, code and backtest in the video here: [https://youtu.be/g\_hnIIWOtZo](https://youtu.be/g_hnIIWOtZo)



What are your thoughts on this one?

Has anyone traded or tested this strategy before?
Very nice! Clean and easy to understand analysis. Likee you mentioned, this does seem like one of those strategies that can't be relied on itself to produce great returns, but can augment a whole trading system with a basket of strategies. There are many such strategies it seems, and this is another one, so nice!

But in your notebook, the results seem to be that the regular strat is better than the 5MA exit strategy, right? It has higher return, higher sharpe, lower max drawdown, higher winrate, and higher avg return?
One of the better posts I‚Äôve seen on here. I had that book for years and finally donated it to my local library. Hopefully an aspiring trader will buy it for cheap and make good use of it.
From what I see..... It looks to identify bull markets fairly decent. It exits during the early 2000's bubble burst and the 2008 housing crisis. If it shorted during those times it would of done ok. But the sideways market areas didnt allow it to do that well during those times.
Going to try this on crypto backtests see how it does üòÖ thanks for the write up!
1.Did you account for slippage?  You can't assume that you will always get the exact price of the open (you won't), so for every trade, you should artificially add $x.xx to your entry price (i.e. reduce the profit/increase the loss of every trade by a margin for slippage).


2.Did you choose your exit strategy based on in-sample or out-of-sample data?   If you're just picking the one that performed best across the entire data set, you're just curve fitting.
Nice
Good deal!!!
Very nice work
Where do you backtest these strategies?
[deleted]
This strategy also looks to work pretty nice on the nifty50 too, nice one!
Guys where do I learn simple strategies like these that work. Do they exist? 
I am good at programming but don't really know how to make up a strategy that can give good backtest results.
Would love to see more content like this
Try with trailing stop loss to break even only.

Use optimised parameters, so basically, the emas you use, set them in a loop, and run all possible options. Maybe you will find a better ema duration. Also, you may try different timeframes. Maybe you get more trade opportunities. 

S&p500 goes up most of the time, I think if you do every day, it goes down by x% then DCA. You will make more money in an account without margin. You don't have to worry much about drawdown.
I don't understand why you are comparing metrics over 34 years. Is that your target time horizon for implementing this strategy? 

Is there something interesting here that I'm missing...any decent index fund probably smokes this over any holding period of a couple random years. Seems like a better starting point to shake this one out is a lower time frame.
Following
i wish you could have compared it to buy and hold during that same timeframe for the ^GSPC numbers.
Very interesting, thank you! I'll check this book from Larry Connors and backtest this strategy myself.

Just one note. I think that by buying at the open of the next day you are doing a great disservice to your backtesting results, as most of SPY's (and I guess the index you picked) gains come not from the trading hours, but from outside the regular hours. That is, if you were to buy at 4pm, instead of 930am next morning, you could largely improve your results.

https://www.isabelnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SP-500-Gains-Outside-Regular-Trading-Hours.jpg

In any case, I took a quick look at AAPL graph in the last weeks and it looks interesting. I will write some code to test it further.
How are you sizing your trades?

Wow good stuff!
Good post with link to code
Double 7 strategy seems chill, but adding a stop loss could spice things up. Maybe Pineify could help tweak those exit strategies to boost the winrate even more with some custom scripts. 5 MA close exit looks solid, but curious how it‚Äôd do on lower timeframes. Anyone tried that yet?
Isn't that just a quantified way of saying "buy the dip"
QuantMage adaption where I used close at a 10 day low / close above 8 day MA instead of 7 / 5:

[https://quantmage.app/grimoire/3169ea78111f4c595ccfcc7751d9c639](https://quantmage.app/grimoire/3169ea78111f4c595ccfcc7751d9c639)
Why do you think the returns were not evenly distributed? For example, 2000-2004 seem relatively flat.   The slope of the later lines seems steeper in a ‚Äúbuy anything‚Äù bull market.
I'm back again and I'm trying to reproduce your results. I don't get the exact same results, probably due to me looking at SPY and calculating fills to include slippage, but it does show profitability, especially with your adjustment of closing when the close price is > 5 MA. But what I found is that the metrics look better or neutral when removing the > 200 MA requirement. Can you please test for the same and post your results? The amount of trades seem to double, with the max drawdown decreasing and winrate staying neutral. In the end, it seems total profit is doubled with seemingly not much of a downside.
I've never heard of this one but there really are a lot of this type of strategy, which is obviously going to do well in a regime where companies that have done well in the past 200 days do well in the future, which has been true in the US for a very long time but is not guaranteed.

Instead of stop-losses, why not use call options?

Instead of using the stock's return, you might try the return compared to the market average (and/or beta-adjusted, if you can get hold of betas at the time of the trade)
An issue I have with this strategy, is that the return is low and the drawdown is proportionally high. While it's in the market for only 20% of the time, this may not be suitable for good returns. Imagine you found 5 of these strategies and were able to get 100% in-the-market. The compounding effects of 5x max -10% drawdowns may out-weigh the benefits of 5x 4% returns.
[deleted]
Thank you! Yes the default strategy performed better than my modified 5MA one, but I noticed that in the original strategy when I changed the number of days in the entry and exit rules from 7 to 8, the drawdown increased a lot. So I felt that the default exit method was optimised and wasn‚Äôt robust since a small tweak to the rules resulted in big changes to the results.
When I tested the variants I saw the 5MA seemed to be quite consistent across different look back periods. For example if the strategy was changed to double 8, the 5MA performs better.
What did you think of the strategies in the book? Apart from this one I also tested his RSI 2 method which also produced decent results but trade frequency was low again.
Yea that‚Äôs the 200MA filter, it keeps the strategy out of the market when the price is below the MA which worked well during those big bearish periods. 
I didn‚Äôt actually test short entries but could be a useful check
Good luck! Hope it holds up. I tested on ftse as well and it worked there too but didn‚Äôt do well on Nikkei, which makes sense since that moves sideways. Would be interesting if it works on crypto. Where do you get data for that? I‚Äôve only tested indices from yahoo finance
Did you had nice results? :)
Thanks!
I use python as it allows me to write my own code. So I download the data from yahoo finance and then generate the trades and work out the returns and other metrics from that all within the code.
Yea it‚Äôs tricky with some of these backtests, they can be sideways for long periods. I think if I was to trade this, it would need to be part of a bigger basket of strategies so that the overall p&l is kinda averaged across multiple systems. But I‚Äôve not got that far in my testing so it‚Äôs just a thought at the moment.
Good to know! Gives more confidence if it works on other indices too. I tested on FTSE and it was good.
look up youtube videos there are tons of strategies some will work and some dont you just have to see which ones peak your interest and try them out. Use chatgpt to make things way way easier and not code manually. 

  
I did some pine script strategies this way it was super easy.
Sure you can just data-mine the best parameter combinations to overfit it, but it would be better to view a heatmap of performance to make sure you're not just hitting a local minima/maxima and getting lucky with one.
There‚Äôs no sizing, it‚Äôs 100% of capital on each trade, unleveraged
I dont get any errors. Try to run notebook in google collab
The calmar ratio (annual return / max drawdown) is significantly better for this strategy than buy and hold. Also I dont think OP accounted for holding short term bonds in the downtime, which will only make that more attractive.
I did wonder that as well and whether the drawdown would scale linearly like that or not. As in, if the system generates more trades but the win/loss and r:r stay steady then the drawdown might not get that much bigger. I don‚Äôt know for sure, but thinking that might be the case. One way I thought of testing that out is that once I have built up a basket of strategies then I can combine them into one backtest and see how they perform together. I would end up with more time in the market so would be interesting to see what happens to the other metrics. But I‚Äôm not there yet, still want to get a few more good backtest results.
Maybe I misunderstand but the max DD is -56.78 which as percentage of the starting balance is only 0.57%, this doesn‚Äôt seem excessively large to me over such a timescale and the fact the balance actually increases quite a lot so could be much less than this.
That link calculates returns with reinvested dividends, that's why it gives a higher value. My backtest is based on the index price so it doesn't include dividends, but if you were to choose a fund that re-invests dividends then yes, the buy and hold returns would be higher.
Are you looking at dividend reinvestment or just price increases though? I'm not sure if OP's backtest is on non-dividend-adjusted SPY
As you said the frequency of the strategies are low. I trade at least 10 strategies systematically. All using options and diff DTE and spreads. So as a whole the strategies offer a good amount of trades over the span of a month. 
But I did enjoy the book as it was the genesis of my path towards back testing and systematic trading. Linda Rashke is another author that provided strong influence early on. The price point for the books were quite an investment for me back then. üòÑ
Interested in the results if you tested it short. I‚Äôm going to overlay this logic over my current system out of curiosity to see what happens
I‚Äôm pretty sure the last time I checked yfinance had at least eth and btc. 

Although last time I checked coinbase, coinmarketcap and coingecko APIs also included a full history, but looks like the free tiers are limited to last 12 months now

Edit: also thanks for sharing your results/research!
let us know what you find.

He's just trying to keep things standardized and simple. I think it's fine as long as you know it doesn't include dividends. If you're worried about the dividends, you can try back-testing with QQQ instead as the dividends are considerably lower.
My Solution for Yahoos export of financial history
Hey everyone,

Many of you saw u/ribbit63's [post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/1fb81iu/alternative_data_source_yahoo_finance_now/)about Yahoo putting a paywall on exporting historical stock prices. In response, I offered a free solution to download daily OHLC data directly from my website [Stocknear ](https://stocknear.com/home)‚Äîno charge, just click "export."

Since then, several users asked for shorter time intervals like minute and hourly data. I‚Äôve now added these options, with 30-minute and 1-hour intervals available for the past 6 months. The 1-day interval still covers data from 2015 to today, and as promised, it remains free.

To protect the site from bots, smaller intervals are currently only available to pro members. However, the pro plan is just $1.99/month and provides access to a wide range of data.

I hope this comes across as a way to give back to the community rather than an ad. If there‚Äôs high demand for more historical data, I‚Äôll consider expanding it.



By the way, my project, [Stocknear](https://stocknear.com/home), is 100% open source. Feel free to support us by leaving a star on GitHub!

This is actually really cool. Good work man!!

I appreciate this!  I hope you make a few bucks for yourself with that pro plan. 

Idk..  shit like this makes me happy. 

When there is a problem 99% just complain and do nothing about it. 

You went and did something about it. And quickly. High five to you. I'd give an award if I wasn't a poor


Edit: someone give this man an award please. I'll write you a very nice **IOU**
i am moved by this, in my heart.  i don't personally need it, but it's an incredible gesture to the world.  thank you.  i hope you're not a total ass and i wish i didn't write this in like 5 years;  but today you are a hero.
My server is still running the script to clean and sort the data for all 6000+ tickers on my database. It will take 4-5 hours until it is completely finished for all companies.

You can test it out for [https://stocknear.com/stocks/AAPL](https://stocknear.com/stocks/AAPL) already.
You are the best u/realstocknear!! I nominate you for r/algotrading Redditer of the Year!
Does it only contain stock data only? I am more i nterested in forex
love you bro,you are my sunshine
Is your historical data adjusted for stocks splits & dividends?
Doing God's work, brother! Kudos, and thanks on behalf of everyone who benefits from this üôè
Is this for after hours data as well?
Thank you. You're awesome!!!
Good job lad
Commenting for future reference. üòçü§§
I mostly calculate beta reports in response to macro events, so I honestly only need monthly data going a few years back to fix the majority of my scripting.

Sounds like that should pan out just fine on the free version. If it does, I'm subbing to Pro just to support this. Yahoo was my saving grace after IEX Cloud died.
I am impressed by what you did. It is awesome. How is it going so far? How many subs?
Will yo be adding volume soon?
Thank you üëë
I really like your product and appreciate that it's open-source. Quick question: which options data provider are you using?
How to get low interval data for further back than 6 months? Are these hard to get ?
OP, quick question for you: are you using all this infrastructure for your own algo strategy or strategies? I'm building something similar for mine so just curious.
Is there a way we can get the historical data for a list of stocks instead of individual stock, without scraping? And thanks for the good work!
I only which I could get 20 levels of orderbook data as easy as OHLC
not to throw cold water here, but reselling equity data is certainly not allowed.
Awesome to see people working hard dit the benefits of the community, thanks man!
[removed]
Any chance for mutual fund data?
This is great. Thank you!
I found this post looking for the simplest way to download historical S&P500 Total Return data. Is that available on your website?
Would be great if you share a small client lib so that we can just do sth like `stocknear.fetch(AAPL, "1h")`
thank you very much. I feel like I owe the community since I benefitted so much from all of you.
‚ù§ apes together strong
Makes me happy if my work is useful to you guys
Currently it support stock and etf data only. I can add forex afterwards
Sending love back to you guys
yes it is adjusted.
Thank you very much.
Yes I can add after hours as well. But currently the dataset does not support it
Hope it helps you out.

Any support is much appreciated!
so far not many. currently a little bit more over 170. 

This number was already present before the post here so don't think I got them all since the last post :D
if you support us sure why not :D
Thank you.

I use benzinga for options data
you can use different providers such as FMP, finnhub, twelvedata etc. to get these kind of data
No but I have some plans to do that in the near future :)
I will keep it in my to-do list but for now I keep it simple with single individual stocks
I have a commercial license which allows me to redistribute the data for my users. I am however not allowed to offer the data via an api endpoint
it's open source man.  write it for him.
You went above and beyond man. 

Be proud. Frfr
Yeah, want to pile on to the thank-yous. I saw your post a few weeks back introducing the front and back ends. You've done great work and I've learned a lot going through your code.
Love this comment :)
If you would be open to contributors. I'd be willing to help create scripts for trading, converting signals etc.
Well I did subscribe to the yearly plan so I‚Äôm locked in
Sure hope so.
That‚Äôs a good catch. Let it not expose via an official api endpoint but let it srapableüò¨
Sounds like custom stock list exports should probably be top priority when you're looking at adding features.

On the one hand, it's another list to manage. On the other hand, if you end up with a mobile app, you might be able to eat quite a bit of Yahoo's lunch.

Edit: I'm also not sure how many people other than me only care about longer (weekly/monthly) intervals, and whether adding those options might save you any bandwidth costs.
don‚Äôt have much experience contributing to open source projects, but bouta go do this
Thank you very much for the support. I will add the volume data tomorrow if this is ok for you
Yeah! Would be great way to gain some experience and contribute to the community
Just please comment and document. Use descriptive variable and function names. Go slow, think through potential exceptions and handle them when you realize their potential occurrence.

Thank you for your service.
May god bless your heart
and yours too brother!
OP, what‚Äôs the best way to download / save ticker data ? Spent hours trying to print data frame but no luck
A Mean Reversion Strategy with 2.11 Sharpe
Hey guys,

Just backtested an interesting mean reversion strategy, which achieved **2.11 Sharpe**, **13.0% annualized returns** over 25 years of backtest (vs. 9.2% Buy&Hold), and a maximum drawdown of **20.3%** (vs. 83% B&H). In 414 trades, the strategy yielded 0.79% return/trade on average, with a **win rate of 69%** and a profit factor of **1.98**.

The results are here:

[Equity and drawdown curves for the strategy with original rules applied to QQQ with a dynamic stop](https://preview.redd.it/ptsjrshdpn1d1.png?width=1350&format=png&auto=webp&s=675b9a055c17ecb18d7a5b683e6e206732d4df8d)

[Summary of the backtest statistics](https://preview.redd.it/ky1f3cagpn1d1.png?width=1344&format=png&auto=webp&s=709b17b15f012f157bfc7e5d2afcff3abe8f0b9a)

[Summary of the backtest trades](https://preview.redd.it/igfihwuipn1d1.png?width=1342&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c8fcf360a4c29fec75465321041f0c3899650f6)

The original rules were clear:

* Compute the¬†**rolling mean of High minus Low**¬†over the¬†**last 25 days**;
* Compute the¬†**IBS indicator**: (Close - Low) / (High - Low);
* Compute a¬†**lower band**¬†as the¬†**rolling High**¬†over the¬†**last 10 days**¬†minus 2.5 x the rolling mean of High mins Low (first bullet);
* **Go long**¬†whenever¬†**SPY closes under the lower band**¬†(3rd bullet), and¬†**IBS is lower than 0.3**;
* **Close the trade**¬†whenever the¬†**SPY close is higher than yesterday's high**.

The logic behind this trading strategy is that the market tends to bounce back once it drops too low from its recent highs.

The results shown above are from an improved strategy: better exit rule with dynamic stop losses. I created a full write-up with all its details [here](https://quantitativo.substack.com/p/a-mean-reversion-strategy-with-211).

I'd love to hear what you guys think. Cheers!
So few trades of such short duration and high win loss suggests very strongly to me it‚Äôs seriously overfitted. Check my math: to go live you could not have 99.5% confident that is was still performing  at 6:1 until 5 years. Why don‚Äôt you trade micro lots for a year and see how you feel then.
Have you tried it on each of the major components of QQQ?
"Compute the rolling mean of High minus Low over the last 25 days;

Compute the IBS indicator: (Close - Low) / (High - Low);

Compute a lower band as the rolling High over the last 10 days minus 2.5 x the rolling mean of High mins Low (first bullet);

Go long whenever SPY closes under the lower band (3rd bullet), and IBS is lower than 0.3;

Close the trade whenever the SPY close is higher than yesterday's high."

How sensitive is the strategy w.r.t. these parameters? E.g. if you take 21 days instead of 25, IBS 0.25 or 0.5 instead of 0.3.

Also be careful when assuming that you both know that the close is higher than yesterday's high and that you can still execute at close. In practice you'd need the price 10 mins before close etc
Seems promising, but still cherrypicked? It seems you benchmarked it against QQQ, but started the benchmark when it was pretty much at its highest (QQQ had an 80%+ drawdown from the dotcom bust). If you had started your backtesting in 2003 instead of 1999, your strategy would have underperformed QQQ. How does the graph look against SPY?


Also worries me that there are only 414 trades, which is a small enough number to possibly be luck based too.
I coded and tested that strategy in Tradingview Pinescript here is the result.

[Tradingview Link Strategy Example](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/QfevgYfZ/)

SPX -> 1995 to now.

* Profit: 478%
* Drawdown: 29.28%

The graph looks nice, but it experienced some struggles after 2017.

I am sharing the indicator code so people can test it in TradingView using the FreedX Backtest indicator (Custom Signal section with importing sources):

    //@version=5
    indicator("Custom Strategy", overlay=true)
    
    // Input variables
    length = input.int(25, title="Rolling Mean Length")
    length_high = input.int(10, title="Rolling High Length")
    multiplier = input.float(2.5, title="Multiplier for Rolling Mean")
    IBS_threshold = input.float(0.3, title="IBS Threshold")
    
    // Compute the rolling mean of High minus Low over the last 25 days
    rollingMean = ta.sma(high - low, length)
    
    // Compute the IBS indicator: (Close - Low) / (High - Low)
    IBS = (close - low) / (high - low)
    
    // Compute a lower band as the rolling High over the last 10 days minus 2.5 x the rolling mean of High minus Low
    rollingHigh = ta.highest(high, length_high)
    lowerBand = rollingHigh - multiplier * rollingMean
    
    // Define buy and sell signals
    buy_signal = close < lowerBand and IBS < IBS_threshold
    sell_signal = false
    close_signal = close > high[1]
    
    // Plotting
    plot(lowerBand, , linewidth=2, title="Lower Band")
    
    // Output signal logic
    output_signal ¬†= 2
    output_signal := buy_signal ¬† ? ¬†1 : output_signal
    output_signal := sell_signal ¬†? -1 : output_signal
    output_signal := close_signal ? ¬†0 : output_signal
    plot(output_signal==2?na:output_signal, title='Output Signal(LONG==1,SHORT==-1,CLOSE==0)', display=display.data_window)color=color.red
I just tested your strategy for an hourly period instead of a daily period for some stocks like SPXL and BITX and for the leveraged stocks it does pretty well. Here are some of my results: 

Exposure Time \[%\]       18.434670

Return \[%\]              91.540093

Buy & Hold Return \[%\]  150.349208

Volatility (Ann.) \[%\]  101.763651

Win Rate \[%\]            66.666667

ETR \[%\]                496.564857  (This just says what the return would be if the return was multiplied for 100% exposure time instead of 18%)
Good stuff. Simple, yet clearly well though out strategy!
Forget about the results. The methodology is more important than the results and you didn't really describe it anywhere. It looks like you made the beginner's mistake of not using a tripartite chronological training/validation/test split of your data. You performed your parameter space exploration using something resembling grid search over the entire dataset which you also performed your backtest with, which is a big no-no. Performing curve fitting with the test dataset will consistently yield amazing **Sharpe ratios greater than 2.0**. Unfortunately they hold **no predictive power** and will fail the paper trading test.

I suggest you throw out all your current parameters and change your methodology such that you at least have bipartite chronological split with the fitting using data from, say, 2000 - 2015 and then the test being performed with data from 2016 - now. Be aware that even such splits still invite curve fitting because people will keep on tweaking the algorithm to improve the results with the second dataset, which will diminish their predictive power. This is why a tripartite split generally yields algorithms with greater predictive power.

Also, I would like to point out that any approach based on just OHLC data is unlikely to beat the market nowadays. For low frequency systems you generally want fundamental analysis and sentiment analysis in addition to price data. For high frequency systems the most important thing might be order flow data.
Looks interesting, could you perhaps check the strategy performance during high/low volatility? From a brief look it seems like the strategy performs better during high volatility periods (which makes sense since you are relying on IBS).

Also, I‚Äôd check how it performs during large SPY movers earnings or other news outside of trading hours.  

This can also apply to specific sectors and other markets that are more volatile and have a higher chance of correcting their price the day after a spike
Did you also compare long term tax rate vs short term? If you take into account short term capital gains you probably aren't beating buy and hold (for at least a year).
I would calculate the returns for each year and compare it to benchmark. Some years appear pretty flat. Not that it's a bad thing but given the low # of trades, you might wonder "is this thing really working?" when you're running it live and the benchmark is outperforming it. Run it through a tearsheet library like quantstats. 

In your article, with the long/short version the max drawdown is reduced but if you use, say, 3x leverage but the total return is still less than the long only version. I think the long only version with 2x leverage would be best. Max drawdown would be the same as S&P 500 but the total return would be much higher. Gotta take taxes and margin interest into account though, I don't know the calculations for this off the top of my head. 

Nice work and thanks for sharing.
What do you use to do the back test?
Looking at the individual trades on a chart, it becomes clear that you get no trades over quite long periods when qqq is trending up and the pullbacks are less volatile. Maybe use an sma-filter to differentiate up-trend vs down-trend? Loosen the thresholds when in uptrend, and tighten the thresholds when in downtrend.

  
I implemented your strategy in tradingview and changed the following differences:

Rolling-high lookback = 25 (same as rolling mean) -> one less parameter

If close > sma50: IBS-threshold = 0.2, band-multiple = 2

if close < sma50: IBS-threshold = 0.1, band-multiple = 3.5

  
Seems to yield quite a lot better results, at least according to tradingview's backtester.
Market  has  changed   over  the  years.     Some  25  years  ago  ,  there was no  market makers ,   number of  computers trading  was   below 20..
..
  Let  it  run  2 -4 √∑ months  in forward  testing mode  (dry run )   real market ,  demo money ...  and    after  x  month    analize it
Here's an idea: why not try and let the profits run for a bit (it would be trying to mix mean reversion with momentum type strategy, but who cares if it works). Also the stop loss of lower than 300-day mean must be very wide during bull market, would you consider some kind of trailing stop instead?

Modified exit rule would be something along the lines: 

- trailing stop as a  rolling mean of high minus low (1st bullet) - or a fraction of it

- potentially (but not necessarily) take profit of rolling low plus 2.5x rolling mean of high minus low (3rd bullet) - to make it symmetrical with entry rule

- scrap the original exit rules 

  
It would be useful to see what's your skewness (or best and worst trade, or  the number for overall best/worst trade ratio that's missing in your per-trade stats). Mean doesn't tell the whole story, it might be heavily skewed by outliers. We like when those outliers are positive but not otherwise.

My guess is that you have few very bad trades, but the best are much smaller (negative skew). Better stop-loss, not necessarily the one suggested above, might improve this.
Tested on GSPC going back to 1928. From 1928 - 1985 it was on a straight pathway to zero. 95 % drawdown with no recoveries in between. Then started to work from 1985 onward.
What is IBS?
What software/website did you use for strategy backtest?
Any code we can look at to backtest it ourselves?
I backtested this from 1980 and sure the equity curve looks like yours. However, the actual Sharpe is not around 2 as that only takes into account the days with returns. Taking into account all the days where you don't have any positions, the actual Sharpe is around 0.65 (before fees).
Yeah one question, does it only work when interest rate is low?¬† See it drawdowns around 2023 onwards when interest rate creep higher. Maybe it's susceptible to regime change ? Backtest data prior to 2022 are all in a period of extremely low interest rate that tends to make stocks bounce back up faster. If interest is going to stay higher for longer does it still work ? # just 2 cents for your consideration¬†
Can you link to the original blogpost where you got the original rules that you mentioned in your blog?
Cool stuff.  Lever that shit up 1.5x
remindMe! 2 day
To OP: What about short performance? I mean us equities have one of the best two decades of long only
The results from 1993 look good but it has massively underperformed buy & hold over the last 10 years.
The strategy mostly hinges on the period 2000-2003. Most of the other years it greatly underperforms B&H. If you can prove the 2000-2003 period would repeat itself in the near future, you have a winner. Since you can‚Äôt prove that, it‚Äôs a losing strategy going forward.

What are you using for your data source? Using NorgateData I was getting sharpe of 0.85 annualized returns of 13% and drawdown of 23% for same timeframe, 99'-24'. And that was without including commissions or slippage.
When are you executing the trade? 

I also had a very good backtest using IBS but the issue was that when running it live, you cannot know the high/low/close of the day and buy on the close, even if you do it at 3:59:59 a second before market close. The high/low and close execution was vastly different than what was reported in the consolidated feed after the trading day is over. 

I would try moving your execution over by one full day (next day close) or next day open, and the backtest results will likely be much worse.
I don't have much to add other than great post! I hope you open source your engine.
Are you using python for backtesting? I‚Äòm trying to reproduce your strategy but with much worse results.
This is an Odmund Grotte strategy, based on Larry Connors (based on Linda Rashkle). I traded stuff like this since 2009 and did well out of it (although my main speciality was VIX trading (when it worked) and then VC). The general idea is to buy short term pull backs then sell a few days later. It works fine if you have the stomach to make the buys on these short term pull backs, that takes balls and I think most people could not do it (it is scary!). It is not really overfitted as anyone can verify by examining how the results change as the parameters vary within an obvious reasonable range. The issue for me is that you can have many years sub 10%, eg for these params here I get 1.8% return in 2023. Nobody would stick with that strategy in reality... you would always be thinking maybe it's been arbed and I need to turn off the strategy. Or years '16, '17, '18, '19 results of 4.8%, 8%, -17%, 7.8%. It's not enough... need to be aiming at things in the 15-20% CAGR range to make it worth the stress and time of running the strategy. IMO
Very interesting and great thorough post. I have a couple questions on the lower band and the rolling high indicators being used:
- is the rolling high a single number each trading day which is equal to the highest high made over the last 10 trading days?
- if so, than the lower band is just a single number as well on each given trading day correct, computed as: rolling high - (2.5 x rolling mean)? 

Thank you for the info, just wanted to be sure I understand! I appreciate it!
This strategy is worse than the buy and hold on the average, it was only able to avoid that huge drop in the beginning. Otherwise the gap between them is closing...
How is the strategy performing now over these last 5 months? This will be a perfect test if the strategy was overfit or not.
Out of curiosity, what platform do you use for back testing?
Nice
How did you learn all of these? How can I start man üò≠
How you do this mate... Can you please tell?
YOU WILL (there is no doubt about it) GET SCREWED by the slippage, backtest with bid/ask data then comeback to us
Can you just use a Bollinger band?
Can you please share the code to reproduce this analysis?
Sooooo... Buy the dip?  Seems ok but it's not earth shattering.
I built a Mean Reversion EA for MT5 that takes $1,000USD and rolls it to $2,000,000 on Brent Crude Oil Cash (XBRUSD) in 25 months. I‚Äôd post a pic of the results but I can‚Äôt here
Yeah, I will change it to trade all components of Nasdaq 100 simultaneously, in parallel
The real overfitting comes from knowing the history of the SP500 over the last year. The whole motivation for the strat is based on ex-post knowledge that the market did, in fact, bounce back after all of the large downturns which occurred.
Also, it would be better to put it into a official national bank, they give you on average the same ¬±13% profit on your account and it's a secure income.
I'd say they are pretty robust. Just ran your suggested numbers (21 days instead of 25, and IBS 0.25 instead of 0.3), and got 1.96 Sharpe, 11.5% annualized returns, and -18% max drawdown. The trade statistics are almost the same: 68% win rate, 1.95 profit factor, 2.11 win/loss ratio, 1.0 payoff.

The equity curve is almost identical.

Regarding your last comment, it's a good point: I'm executing the orders at the price of the next open, so we are covered there. :)
Is it a bad strategy if the Sharpe is sensitive to these parameters? Aren't all strategies sensitive to something?
Starting on Jan-1st 2003, the strategy would have achieved an even higher Sharpe (2.22) and lower max drawdown (-17.1%), but indeed a lower annualized return vs B&H (10.5% vs 14.5% QQQ... but higher than 8.6% S&P 500). Btw, important to highlight: the exposure time is only 14.8%.

Here's the equity curve [vs. Buy&Hold](https://imgur.com/a/WTcG7NB), and [vs. S&P 500](https://imgur.com/QMOQcro).
Thanks, do you also have a graph of that?
Thanks! I'm sorry, but I didn't do a grid search at all! In fact, I stuck with the same parameters throughout the whole strategy development. There's no need to train/test/validate if you are not changing any parameters... I did no "parameter space exploration" as you mention whatsoever :)

In fact, as I pointed out in the full write-up, **I don't believe in parameter optimization at all**, as I believe they lead to overfitting as you rightly said. So, I did zero optimization. 

You have a good point regarding fundamental analysis and sentiment analysis. During this great discussion, someone pointed out the low # of trades, and a good way to fix that is to trade all components of Nasdaq 100 individually, in parallel, using the strategy rules. I believe that will be a great opportunity to use fundamental analysis as you mention, to prioritize stocks with good fundamentals.

I personally don't think I can beat the game at high-frequency trading, so I don't even try... don't even look at order flow data...
Great points‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll check them for sure! I‚Äôm thinking about changing the strategy to make it trade all Nasdaq 100 components individually, in parallel, and what you are suggesting is a good criteria to select which ones to prioritize
No, I didn't. This is a critical topic... if you start thinking you must pay up to 37% in capital gains if you trade short-term (<1 year) vs. up to 20% long-term (>1 year), you might end up giving up and just buying a low-cost ETF and forgetting about it until retirement. If you are too much concerned about it (and I'm not saying you shouldn't be), maybe algorithmic trading is not for you, because it will certainly mean you have to pay much more taxes than just buy & hold.

Now, having said that, I don't think simulating backtests with tax considerations is a good idea. Let me tell you why I think so:

1. It's personal. Every person has a different tax bracket depending on his/her tax planning strategies. So, 2 different persons might execute the same strategy and get totally different results (i.e. one pays 10% taxes, and the other 37%). This by itself is a no-go for me, as it will make it harder to compare 2 different backtest results (you might end up comparing apples to oranges without knowing it).

2. It's complex to implement. It's not that the US tax rules for short/long-term capital gains are too complex (there are countries with way more complex rules), but writing the code to compute taxes will indeed add complexity to the code base and make the runs slower.

Does that make sense?
Many many many years ago I implemented a back test engine in python for my master‚Äôs degree‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs an event-driven engine (they are slower than the vector-based engines but imho they are easier to write strategies for, understand and debug) with all blows and whistles, similar to the late zipline. In fact, I tried most of the python back test engines that exists, and that‚Äôs why I prefer to use what I built over the years: I have 100% of understanding of what‚Äôs happening, and 100% of control. I‚Äôm thinking about open sourcing it‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not that complicated, not even 1000 lines of code‚Ä¶
Yeah, I tried Market Regime Filters... I tried SMA 150, 200, and 300: 300 worked best... I don't know about TradingView's backtester... I'm not particularly a fan of using backtest engines that either i) are free, or ii) I haven't developed it myself (so I truly understand what is happening and have 100% of control over it)
Great points, thanks! As I reported in the [full write-up](https://quantitativo.substack.com/p/a-mean-reversion-strategy-with-211), I tried fixed stops, but they never quite worked. I'll try trailing stops and your suggestion of exit rules.

Regarding the distribution of trades:

- In the 4th line of the 2nd table I reported the best/worst trades: +18.07%, -10.75%;

- Here's the [histogram with the distribution of all trades](https://imgur.com/FMmSs4y). The red line is the median (0.92%), while the green lines are 5% and 95% percentiles (-3.8%, +5.1%): 90% of trades occur in this range.

Contrary to what you guessed, there's a positive skew... but anyway, I will try your modified exit rules... thanks!
If you follow the rules I shared, you should get the exact same results. Anyway, to help even further, I'm thinking about open-sourcing my backtest engine..
Great to hear!! Regarding sharpe ratio: the correct way to compute it is to consider only the days where we have positions in our portfolio. We should not consider the days where we are 100% in cash.
The rules don‚Äôt take interest rates into consideration
It was a post on [quantifiedstrategies.com](http://quantifiedstrategies.com) that I found I saved some time ago.

I can't find the original, they keep changing the website...
I tried using leverage... a lot... PSQ and TQQQ... it never quite worked. Although I was able to increase returns, the Sharpe ratio suffered a bit... but the big hit was always on drawdowns. And as I am really trading these, larger drawdowns are not an option. (More about everything I tested [here](https://quantitativo.substack.com/p/a-mean-reversion-strategy-with-211)...)
And also try other international equities that are a bit sideways (e.g., China)
Thanks... but just to highlight: the exposure time is only 15%! Had you been invested in Buy&Hold only 15% of the time, you'd see how great the strategy is in comparison to B&H. Or put in another way: looking at the exposure-adjusted return (annualized), you see 86.6% annual return vs 9.2 B&H!

Of course, it's not realistic to assume we could complement this strategy so that we could be invested 100% of the time (which is what the exposure-adjusted return considers). But say we can complement this strategy with 2-3 additional strategies with similar characteristics, so that we could double the exposure to say 30%: this means we would be able to double the annual returns, reaching over 25%.

Looking at the strategy as is, standalone, I'd say it is good but not great yet. To be great, we need to add more strategies to it and increase the exposure time. It's a good start, but not the end product. (Yet.)
For those, I used Yahoo... Norgate is not an option; it doesn't work for Mac. But I'll have to redo it using Sharadar. I used 1 basis point of slippage
I always execute on the open (backtest, forward test, or live trade): it's much easier
Yes... I'll open-source my backtesting engine so everyone can reproduce the results... 

What are you using to backtest?
The draw down is super low though. You can easily combine this with another strategy or a risk free rate sort of investment. Heck, you could even buy and hold and since we're only in the market 15 percent of the time we can afford to make the trades on margin

I'm super curious what you think because I might run a similar strategy to this

5 years of college (aerospace engineering) + 5 years of grad school (masters in computer science) + good courses of finance engineering/derivatives/etc + over 5 years of discretionary trading/investing + an very large number of books..

My suggestion to get started from zero: learn to code, learn the math (especially probability & statistics... and calculus if you want to trade derivatives), read everything you can get your hands on,  study as much as you can... and start small... 

For sure there are other ways, but I think this one minimizes the risks involved in the journey :)
Sure‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know if you saw, by the end of the post I linked a more complete write-up, where I explain with more details this strategy. Take a look, and if you have any inputs/comments/questions just let me know! :)
400 trades in 24 years. Slippage is not a major issue.
All the runs consider 1 basis point in slippage costs, which imho is fine for such a liquid asset.

Increasing it to 5 basis points would lead to 2.01 Sharpe (vs. 2.11) and 12.3% annual returns (vs 13.0%).
If you follow the rules I shared, you should get the exact same results. Anyway, to help even further, I'm thinking about open-sourcing my backtest engine..
Mean reversion at its best :)
Try the top 7. They make up 50% or so. Individually I would expect more trade opportunities. Ideally optimise each individually.
what are you even saying?
What country are you in where a national bank pays 13% per annum interest?
I'd extend the backtest as SP500 data is easily accessible and "paper trade" before putting actual money on it. Good luck!
The more parameters, the easier it is to overfit/find a combination that works from pure luck. 

E.g. "Compute the rolling mean of High minus Low over the last N=25 days;

Compute the IBS indicator: (Close - Low) / (High - Low);

Compute a lower band as the rolling High over the last M=10 days minus r=2.5 x the rolling mean of High mins Low (first bullet);

Go long whenever SPY closes under the lower band (3rd bullet), and IBS is lower than  q=0.3;

Close the trade whenever the SPY close is higher than yesterday's high."

Here we have N,M,r,q as parameters. If you run N and M in [5, 252], r and q in [0.1, 0.2, ..., 5], you'll have 247x247x50x50 potential combinations, or over 152 million combinations. A decent PC can run this as a for loop in minutes and spit out the best Sharpe. This method is guaranteed to fail. This is why it's critical to test robustness of parameters.
I hope someone else can correct me if I'm wrong, but since the exposure time is only 15%, can't the remaining balance be considered as earning the risk-free rate (currently ~5%)? 

Of course this risk-free rate changes throughout the years, with most of the years returning 0%.
Oh, but you did change parameters. You changed the trailing stop rule, the SMA window size and possibly other things. As soon as you adjust these based on knowledge from the "future" (i.e. the holdout dataset), you're curve fitting outside the training data.
Nice, well done mate
Interested. Will follow you in case you do. Thx
ok, I think I misinterpreted what your line best/worst trade meant, these are indeed the numbers that I wanted.

From the histogram, positive skew is clear... event better for the strategy. 

Still trailing stops might improve performance. With profit taking it's easy to overfit, but I would still run 1 or 2 simmulations with some broadly sensible numbers.
This would be very cool. Looking at building my own right now so would love to see yours to get new ideas
I may be looking for the code as well
Well no, when you're 100% in cash you have a 0 Sharpe.
Yeah I know that. What I am saying is this backtest may be subjected to regime change as most data during the backtest period is an environment of very low interest rate.¬† So it may not be as profitable as it is now.¬†
In the [full write-up](https://quantitativo.substack.com/p/a-mean-reversion-strategy-with-211), I wrote about a long&short solution. Shorts improve the backtest results..

However, I tried the strategy in some international markets, and they did not quite work...
I also tried to repro using Norgate from \~99'-23', QQQ, executions on next day opens. I get similar results to FeverPC. There is a nasty drawdown during Covid 2020 that I don't see in the posted equity curve [https://imgur.com/a/DWyptSC](https://imgur.com/a/DWyptSC)
Oh interesting. Looks like I need to re-evaluate IBS and try these rules out! I will post back if I can reproduce similar results
Awesome, I like backtracking.py. Not well maintained but super handy for such tests.
[strategy on GitHub](https://github.com/fxhuhn/backtesting-trading-strategies/blob/main/strategies/mean_reversion_ndx100.ipynb)
Did you have the time to take a look at the code to see where the error in my thinking lies?
Hi. I agree with all that. Although... 20% DD is not "super low", it's actually normal or a little bit high (for a good strategy).

This is a perfectly reasonable strategy to run, especially, like you say, if you pair it with a fixed income asset, or some sort of trending strategy or even just an investment in the S and P 500.
Definitely open source it. I'm sure many people would like to compare your approach with what they're doing. Plus then any results you present can be audited and hence gain credibility.
average trade duration is  4 days, average return is 0.79%, I still think bid/ask backtest is necessary
Kk cool, I'll attempt to reproduce this weekend when I have time.

And that would be greatly appreciated if you do!
Yeah, I'll do something like that. (It's not that simple because I need to get the top N (7 or 100 or any number) stocks at that specific point in time in the past... otherwise we would be introducing survivorship bias...)

I get what he‚Äôs saying - He‚Äôs likely referring to calculating the indicators on the entire historical data vs. warming up the indicators and performing iterative backtesting (i.e when the algo can‚Äôt ‚Äúsee‚Äù what‚Äôs ahead). Many ideas I had failed at this step in the backtesting process.
Colombia
100% this.

OP: I'd be curious to see a walk forward analysis, and parameter sensitivity charts.
How do you test for robustness?
"The more parameters, the easier it is to overfit/find a combination that works from pure luck."

I agree. But in the context, the OP had apparently 24 years of data. Isn't it hard to overfit on such length given relatively small number of parameters? It's not like a machine learned model with thousands of weights.

And I don't think optimizing 152M params can be done in only minutes. If the search space is this large, I'd imagine different people come up with different tactic to choosing the parameters. It's not like everyone would come to the same solution, as you implied, given enough computing power, which is just mainstream.
You are right, but I didn‚Äôt compute the risk free rate on the cash for the sake of simplicity. Also, the plan is to add 2-3 strategies to run together with this one, so we can increase the exposure. Say we can add those strategies and they have the same characteristics of this first one, and we manage to increase the exposure time to 50%. In that case, we would be able to double the return, reaching over 25% pa
The risk free rate hasn‚Äôt averaged anywhere near 5% over the last decade

You gave op some of the best advice. But he seemed to refuse the logic. I chuckled. The market never failed to teach the smartest lessons while extracting a cost, let alone the overconfident.
Imho that's a pretty purist view... in a very strict sense you are right.

I know this is a controversial point... But I know other professional quant traders and practitioners in general who share the same view I practice. In the end, imho, there is the science of things, and there is the engineering of things. And I'm an engineer..

Anyway, let's see how this strategy behaves in the forward test! :)
That's incorrect... You should only consider days when you were exposed to risk (days when cash is different than 100%)
[https://quant.stackexchange.com/questions/7013/sharpe-ratio-in-days-with-no-open-positions](https://quant.stackexchange.com/questions/7013/sharpe-ratio-in-days-with-no-open-positions)
Didn‚Äôt look in details, but just opening it 3 things caught my eye:
- although simple, my ‚Äúiterate‚Äù method (similar to your ‚Äúnext‚Äù) has over 50 lines of code. Yours has way fewer lines
- as I mentioned somewhere in the thread, I always trade at the opening of a day, based on yesterday‚Äôs close/indicators‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt see that in your code
- didn‚Äôt see the exit rule implemented.
In my experience, these kind of details matter a lot in this game.. hope it helps! Cheers
Even for something as liquid as QQQ? I can‚Äôt imagine it making much of a difference
I do medium/long term equities with end of day buy/sell calculations . There I calculate the daily value rather than capitalisation and only select those from the entire market that have a median daily $ great enough that my trades have sufficient liquidity.  For optimisation I use the most recent years that represent my guess at the current nature of the economy. Of that, I take a random third of the equities out of the training data as independent test data. I also test on the entire market in prior years that had a clearly different economy, e.g. pre to pose COVID. To ensure that a change in the market will not fail the system completely. When both test sets stop improving I stop the optimisation.
[deleted]
I don‚Äôt see how using the past 20 years of data is overfit to the history of the sp500 over the last year. By including the past different market regimes, we can see that it reacted and upheld in different cycles. The market has been in a steady upward bias for the last 100 years, indeed if that would not be the case for the next 10 years, then sure this strategy won‚Äôt work in this environment.(mean reversion still would have less DD than buy and hold in this instance) Otherwise, the strategy is exploiting a mean reverting behavior that is inherent to all the markets.
I mean, essentially yes? if you look at the equity indexes over the past 100 years you would, indeed see that chart goes up. I dont really understand why the need to claim it is overfitted just because the indexes have indeed gone only up over the past 100 years. The risk of ruin is covered by the 200 ma, so I really dont understand why use the term "overfit" here.
What do you mean the algo "sees" what is ahead? My Pine script algos can only work with past data.
Lol and what about currency exchange risk? Youll lose all your money due to peso depreciation (due to market or law).
minus the 6.x % inflation.
Thx! I'm starting forward test this week, will share an update once I start getting results
A surface of backtests. Visualise it and pick the simulation that is surrounded by an island of profitable runs.

If you just get a spike in a sea of unprofitable backtests, then the strategy is not robust and most likely just an outlier.
It may be 24 years of data, but it's only 400 trades, so definitely small enough to overfit
Sounds promising, don't see anything wrong with it, good luck!

Edit: Actually the downside I see is that with such few trades of about 1 a month, it'll take you a couple years of trading before you'd know if this system is working or not working. Because after 1 year of trading, lets say your winrate is only 40%, is that due to a couple bad luck trades or is the system not working? So the downside is that you could potentially waste years trading an unprofitable strategy before you realize it
How do you compute sharpe without the risk free rate? Sharpe is literally returns versus risk taken with the risk free rate as a baseline. If the risk free rate isn‚Äôt true/correct, your sharpe ratio will be way off.
This the way! 

What happens when you run the same strat on lower timeframes tho? Moar trades != moar better?
You performed look ahead bias (statistics conxept) when tweaking your strategy. Market will tell you, when the strategy stops working and your strategy starts losing money or stagnating.
If you drive 100kmh for an hour, stop for 30mins and then drive again 100kmh for an hour. What's the average speed throughout the journey? 

This is how people would read into it if their money was being invested. Unfortunately noone would read this as 2 Sharpe.
Backtesting.py trades by default on next days open. As I said, it‚Äôs super handy.
Pick some date in the past, and set it as the ‚Äúpresent‚Äù and test to see how well it does when it‚Äôs introduced to the following days. You ‚Äúsee‚Äù the following days but the algo cannot.
Every currency suffers a depreciation due to inflation, do not they?
Inflation will affect your investments, no matter if it's trading or bank PM.
Ah, walk forward analysis is robustness testing technique.  Where you take a portion of the data (and leave the other portion as "out of sample") optimize parameters for it, then apply those parameters to the out of sample.  Do this repeatedly over different portions of data. 

Here's a link for more.

Great point!
Great points‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm thinking here‚Ä¶ maybe a solution to the low number of trades is to change the strategy so it trades all Nasdaq 100 stocks individually, in parallel. Then, I‚Äôd expect around 100x more trades I the same timeframe..
Good point! Currently my whole setup/code is designed to place orders once a day, once the market opens‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd have to implement a big change to test your suggestion‚Ä¶

LATAM politics currently are shit and mex,col and ch are depreciating, so its a big no no during the short term at least.
Sure, but it is the amount - in relation to the interest paid - is important.
In other words: in this context, walk forward testing has nothing to do with live forward testing.
I'm thinking about looking at this and turning it into something that can be run on NQ so that instead of a few trades a year it's a few trades a month
That sounds great, I do that too. Just be care about overfitting if you start changing the numbers in your algorithm to fit to each stock individually, because there will definitely be stocks that are just super unprofitable with this strategy. But trading on all stocks should definitely provide you with a good sample size much earlier on, even if it's not as profitable or even unprofitable.
So this is daily chart and only trades ~1/month?
Nothing wrong with the premise I guess, just need more algos by it's side. Does the same strat work on other index markets for you?
Run this on NQ? RTY? YM? Other futures?
Just telling you how people would view it in practice, not in theory
But also remember that it's a SECURE investment, where trading is unsure, so I think it's worth it.
Yeah, totally... I'm really NOT into optimization, so I will apply the same global (fixed) parameters to all stocks
Yes, about \~1/mo... and yes, you are right: I will complement it with additional strategies to increase the exposure (and thus the number of trades).. No, it works basically on equities, large caps (QQQ, SPY)
In practice, people don't include days with no positions, as explained by Chris Aycock
Here's another source saying that, in practice, people don't include them:

[https://quantnet.com/threads/sharpe-ratio-question.3217/](https://quantnet.com/threads/sharpe-ratio-question.3217/)

There are tons of resources explaining that people exclude days with zero risk and why... hope it helps!
That I have not internalized yet. In that sense I'm still gambling sometimes when trading, I need to work on that.
If you want a more flattering backtest number sure, if you want to be transparent with investors then it's incorrect/misleading.
I understand your point. But that's not my point. My point is this:

* The industry computes the Sharpe ratio by excluding the days with zero exposure.
* If we, in our calculations, do not follow what the industry practices, it will be impossible to compare 2 different strategies. We must follow the industry standard, otherwise we would be comparing apples to bananas.

I assure you I don't care about flattering backtest numbers. (In fact, I only care about the profit a strategy makes, but that's another discussion :)). I'm only following the industry standard as any other professional, so people can compare apples to apples.

But I understand you. You have a problem with how the industry computes the Sharpe ratio. I personally don't mind. If the industry's standard were to compute including all days with zero exposure as zero (which is not what they do), I'd do it, no problem.
Has anyone successfully made money from algorithmic trading?
Is it consistent earning?
Yeah dude, buildings full of people in NYC, London, Hong Kong.
I've been trading 5 or so strategies for about a month and am ahead of QQQ by about 8%, have been using StrategixTrading to trade them, saw them on another post a while ago and it made it pretty easy to just implement my ideas. One thing that's been working has been using inverse ETFs and that seemed to basically negate my losses during the recent down turn
[deleted]
I currently make money year over year with the strategies that I deploy. Currently I run four different strategies in production and I don't share specific details about them simply because sharing details would lead to them being ineffective. Some sharing their algo will see a dip in liquidity, or worse, banks using your strategy for liquidity. The key is to develop a decent strategy, with 60% or better average W/L and trade adequate risk profiles. Balance that over a period of the with other assets. That's the most that I can give without giving away too many gems. You don't realize how many times I had the backspace and delete things that I really wanted to say.
Yes, been at it for years and now have 70 different systems I can deploy based on what's working or not.

The past year I've tested 450 different systems and about 425 of them led to nothing

 *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*
I do. Not a single losing month in a year, except July 24 due to the correction in tech and too many strategies deployed. Still up 20% YTD tho. 
Have corrected my issues and did a better risk management setup, should be able avoid losing months now. 
It was a lot of work to get a profitable system and mostly consistent, but now it‚Äôs mostly supervision and minor adjustments every few weeks. 
Making money is the boring part actually lol
I have. I succeeded in finding recurring option pricing patterns through extensive backtesting. The algorithmic trading implementation is actually very simple through my broker‚Äôs API and Microsoft Power Automate. The difficult part is understanding how options are priced, finding patterns, thoroughly backtesting ideas to exploit them, then forward testing in paper trading for months  to validate the backtest results.

For me, the key to success stop wasting time with TradingView indicators and other commonly used tools. Instead I focused on finding recurring patterns in derivatives to predict future prices.
I don't actually trade using any bot, but I have a system that 1) optimize indicator parameters for every component of a couple indexes that I track, 2) scan for on-going setups based on my strategy and 3) give me alerts about entries and exits. I do the trade by myself, sending the order, setting up stops and keeping an eye on that. I am currently swing trading at weekly level and my performance is not too consistent. It is withing 2% to 10%/month.
For a couple of months and then my strategy died.
Yeah this girl called Jane, cant remember what street she lived on though, Oh and her cousin Hudson - he lives by a river
Jim Simons. He pretty much invented algorithmic trading and made billions from it.

Read about him. It is amazing.
Yep, it‚Äôs not about algo trading though it‚Äôs about the strategy behind the algo. Code can only do what you tell it to do. Consistency depends on the strategy‚Äôs at play. For example I have a bot that does risk free spreads. The bot is just the tool to get into risk free spreads that are greater then the risk free rate before options prices revert back to that of no arbitrage opportunity‚Äôs. That is to say anyone could do this without an algo but it would be damn hard as compared to computer program that can scan a bunch of options chains all at the same time to find and fill such opportunities that may only appear for a couple seconds.
1) yes
2) consistent 
3) api with various brokers during earnings

Consistently. Questions feel free to ask (I'm institutional)
Yes. Damn near every day.

Yup.  Started in crypto markets as a hobby and as a long time developer.  Tired of the volatility went into Forex and after a year or two of testing went live and been happy with it since.  Still toy with it from time to time.
They are people that do but it's very hard, and do not expect that someone is going to give "one method works for all" because if they really were to find some genius indicator, strategy etc. they would not share it and most likely trying to scam you.
Look into the German YT from Rene Balke.
i did for a year until it gets fucked by the market last year. now its still floating loss and still trying to save it.
I do. Its a combination of algorithmic trading and options for risk management. Win rate is very low but profits are very decent.

Yes, there‚Äôs just not enough liquidity in the market to make me a billionaire. Especially market impact and TCs

10-13% cagr over last 7yrs - absolutely

Market makers
The people selling the Algorithmic trading software.
Trading around 8 months. First algos were very hit and miss, made big gains, lost all gains later, but at least I was always break even. Been using a new algo for the last 3 - 4 months and it's performing 30% better than the market. So promising start let's hope it stays this way.
Well, actually learning and analyzing data in my spare time, therefore I hope so jaja
But I believe people won‚Äôt share how they made money from it
Yea
Yes, but the income is unstable. It very much depends on the strategy and the market phase. I think the best way to achieve stable income is to create a portfolio with different types of strategies.
Thank you python
If you want to make money in the stock market, the key is to make fewer, more strategic trades rather than constantly buying and selling like algos do. 

By trading less, you avoid the risk of the law of large numbers eating into your profits. With limited resources, sticking to fundamentals is more likely to pay off.
there used to be quite a few profitable alg traders on this forum, both private and institutional.  right around the time the crypto goofs showed up, they stopped posting.
In the earlier days of BTC and some of the alt coins I did at home but beyond that - no.
Nope you‚Äôd be the first. /s
anyone who did, won't say it here. It is my belief that as a retail you can find some edges here and there and get a decent return, but you have to think outside the box (using other kinds of datasets etc.), just using historical data about price/volume/volatility etc. is probably not enough.
Good post about algorithmic trading.  Love this.
Yes, I have been using Zapant and managed to beat QQQ by a lot this year.
I wrote my own custom program and had two $4,000 + days in a row last week. This was amazing to watch!
The acquired podcast did [an episode](https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/renaissance-technologies) on Renaissance Technologies, the most successful company at algorithmic trading. They have never lost money since their algorithm was officially deployed.
I sell put and call option trades, earn money from time value, steady and slow. I have my algorithm and my margin is big (selling 2 million dollars put trades), so I earn $200k last year, and $120k the first half year. I have my algorithms explained in my videos (YouTube channel: MathPhdTrading) and open source code: https://github.com/bluedabadi/SchwabAutoTrading. You are all welcome to check it out.
I tried almost everything available out there. It turned out that diversification is the way to go, get some forex bot, some crypto bot and some indicator for stocks. Try to remove correlation between them, f.e. don't use two mean reverting bots for same security. Try to find bots which are in initial phase, because they will probably dry out with time.

It‚Äôs very hard. I‚Äôve been testing algos with ex guys from citadel and millennium.

Went over 270 algos. None meets min requirements. Market is overloaded with algos.

The best way is private data feed and collocation placement of servers.

Then you‚Äôll figure out it‚Äôs better to provide financial services instead of algo trading in that infrastructure. For example helping to close big positions with min slippage or clear arbitrage strategies well optimized that are making 0.04% daily :)

So I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs very tough and competitive space and requires very solid infrastructure- which is 70% of success.
I'm trying, starting to feel sketch about it though. Does anybody use Alpaca Trading currently (like today)?
Yeah, it depends how smart your strategy is. Most arr only momentary and algo traders always try to find new edge
Yes but it is 0.34%
Yes but it is 0.34% profit, I would like much more
I have been close to working 1.5 years on developing a prediction model, but to no avail. Still going strong though. Got a strong sense of fundamentals now. Anyone open to collab?
There will be lot of fluff but no proof if anyone made any money using bots. Dont trust.
I have "all" my trades through various APIs live.

I don't do point and click. 

I can't imagine what life would be like to stare at a screen for 10h. 

It gives me time to find other opportunities and hobbies. Like I found an anomaly in Hungary and with PDD (Temu) between 14-18 October this year. So I automate that and go on with my life. 

The idea of point and click is just wasting time. No?
A very interesting discussion. In my opinion, it would be ‚Äúthe easiest‚Äù for you to develop EOD systems on portfolios in the US stock market, e.g. all stocks or a basket from the S&P 500. Not only one individual stock or so. A portfolio of about 100 stocks or more. In addition, you should be very intensively involved with the system development itself. There are many pitfalls here. Examples include survivorship bias, in sample/out of sample and robustness tests. You can make a lot of mistakes here if you don't know what you're doing and how to do it properly. However, I can reassure you. If you take enough time and deal intensively with the subject matter (the principles of successful system development), you will achieve your goal. There are also numerous good books on this subject (e.g. by Perry Kaufmann, Kevin Davey, Prent Penfold and many others). Martyn Tinsley also has some very good videos on system development on YouTube. In addition, you should not have exaggerated expectations. Consistently getting 100% with 10% max. DD from the market is an illusion. The Jim Simons mentioned above had a return of just nearly 40% (after costs) over many years. And he was one of the best. Or look at the performance of all the legends like Warren Buffet. They are all between 20-30% p.a. (ok, Buffet is not a system trader but he is a benchmark). As a private trader, however, you can definitely achieve a performance of > 30% p.a. with EOD systems on US equities (averaged over many years, i.e. there can be years with -5%, but also years with 100%). That is more than realistic. In addition, you should definitely aim to trade several systems at once (e.g. 5 or 6). This smoothes the equity curve and reduces your risk. Before I forget, you also need a good data provider. If the data doesn't fit, your system won't work in reality. That's it in a nutshell for now. Just write if anything is unclear or needs explaining. Please don't be annoyed if an answer takes a little longer, but I will reply in any case.
I have and still am
Yeah for over 5 years ongoing.

Ask me anything
I went through 11 months of uncertainty and struggle before finally hitting a breakthrough with my algo. It wasn‚Äôt easy‚Äîthere were definitely moments where I questioned if all the effort and server costs were worth it. But now, we‚Äôre seeing results.

I just shared my journey and the live results over at r/daytrading: [Sharing My Algo Building Journey with Results](https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1flwdxf/sharing_my_algo_building_journey_with_results/)

The key now is to keep pressing on, seek feedback, and continuously refine the algo. It‚Äôs a long game, but it feels like we‚Äôre on the right track.
I just joined gemalgo.com they have years of proven results and I was able to sign up for free. I am averaging 9 percent a month going on 3 months
I do. But mostly using options instead of stocks.

My broker has been making bank off me for years.
There are a lot of caveats here. They mostly avoid trading on exchanges, preferring to cross trades internally, take retail flow, hit dark markets or bank internalizers, etc. You have access to none of these, and the shit that actually gets exhausted to the market really is shit. They also have the trader's option -- their real revenue comes from management fees moreso than performance fees. Most investors are happy with an uncorrelated 1.0 sharpe, but you're not going to get rich on that. There are quite few who've gotten significantly *wealthy* on trading alone. It's hard to really do much at a size that can generate real wealth.

- a dude at a $200mm hedge fund running on ~3000 signals and only achieving around 2.0 sharpe
Yup it's the business model of a lot of very fancy financial companies. 

If you ask if a private person without an army of math quants has made money in the last couple decades the short answer is NO. The long answer is NOOOOO. 

To compete with those fuckers you would need a blue ocean case like the dude who made a billion algorithmically gambling on horse races in Hongkong. In stocks you have not a sliver of a chance. The moment you make significant amounts of money one of the algorithmic trading firms will figure it out and screw you over with low latency access to all stock exchanges and powerful server farms running software written by c geeks.

I feel like they make more off commissions and fees for their services than profiting off their algorithms
Aren't those people making the most profits from fees on money people who think they can make money in the market give to them?
Nice, beating QQQ by 8%, that's actually crazy. I'm also them and it's super easy. Been messing with inverse ETFs to handle the dips as well. Having a set strategy really helps when the market gets choppy

ive been wanting to start algo trading for a long time but couldnt find a good broker. can you recommned a broker where i can also daytrade
A poker game?
When you say "not enough liquidity", you're talking about limit orders? I've always used market orders to guarantee instant fills, and the spread from limit orders isn't even that noticeable for me
I disagree. My algo runs close to a 40% win rate. I still make money. It comes down to effective risk reward/ratio * Win percentage.
Do you compare your performance against any benchmark? If yes, would you mind to say roughly (a range would be more than sufficient) how is it performing?
I know this is a difficult question to answer without sharing too much info, and I don‚Äôt want you to feel pressured to give away too much, but how do develop strategies in the first place? Do you look at the thousands of strategies people have published and then tweak the ones you like until it‚Äôs profitable? Or have you kinda just come up with your own from your own understanding/niche?
What do mean by ‚ÄúBalance that over a period with other assets‚Äù? I don‚Äôt understand that bit.
I‚Äôm new so excuse my ignorance.
Don‚Äôt you just need the winners to win more than the losers lose. So is a 60 or more win rate even necessary.
If sharing details here on such a small group would make them ineffective, then it‚Äôs very questionable whether they even have any edge in the first place. Ppl have shared plenty of strategies on YouTube or books widely and still they work well as markets are huge
would you be willing to share at least approach? what I mean by that is, is it ML, systematic, NN? Btw 60% for 1R seems extremely high, I feel like 55% would be enough to overcome fees, slippage and make decent return, at least when playing bigger moves.
70! Thats some diversity. Nicely done
do you use SQX
I thought I was being too optimistic having tested about 100 

I have only 3 from those 100 and was getting kinda discouraged
Do you use in house system to back test?

What data goes into those systems‚Äîfeed data? Like polygonio? Or other data?

Thank you @snailnaked6842
can you recommned me a good broker where I can run my trading algo for daytrading. all the brokers i've found had this pattern day trading policy
How long did it take you to get there? Also, what would you recommend to someone starting?
Isn't this just buying the trend. And as crypto's been on an upward trend generally you're getting profits?
How did you think of this
Possibly a stupid question but 2 mod 4 and 1 mod 4?
You just discovered Bitcoin's 4 year halving schedule around which all major market moves are based. Doesn't take an algorithm to figure that one out lad.
If you don‚Äôt mind sharing, could you provide some insight into the risk management strategies that you recently employed?
How many years did it take you to learn this or did you already have a background in it.
Could you share a little bit about the ‚Äòminor adjustments every few weeks?‚Äô You don‚Äôt have to share the specifics, just wondering what you would have to adjust for since I read that strategies based on moving averages gets overfitted easily, tuning it every once in a while might make it even more overfitted? (I‚Äôm new to this)
Is that after taxes?

I've had no trouble finding and implementing (other people's researched) strategies that have upside over indices. It's always the taxes calculation that stops me from putting much money into any of them.
> Still up 20% YTD tho

Significantly less than if you just bought BTC at year start.
You using bot to trade?
TradingView is underrated in my opinion. My custom strategy has 10+ built in indicators that I can tune to the financial instrument I‚Äôm trading to improve/filter my trade signals. Alternatively, I can plot and send the unfiltered indicator metadata on my JSON payload for more advanced handling in my Python code. It is more robust than most people give it credit for - aka, it‚Äôs not ‚Äújust a simple charting tool‚Äù.
I agree with you on the looking for patterns in the data. Patterns that are not noise. Patterns that repeat into the future. Myself, I look for patterns in ETF EOD data. I'm curious how you go about finding the patterns. Would you describe it as a pure data mining process? Do you do it manually or automate it in some way?
Can you give us an example of what kind of patterns? Something like correlations? What kind of tools are you using? ( math topics )
What‚Äôs your rationale for not deploying a bot?
Great guy.
How do you know and measure when your model is overfit vs if it has generalised when optimizing/training? Thank you!
Can you share your strategies? Can I dm?
This is not how it works.

* People with successful algos love the game, so they are always trying new things
* People with any algo are afraid of things melting down, so they are generally plugged in when the market is open.
* Creating a successful algo is hard, and isn't really done by people who are lazy and dream of doing nothing. If you want money, with as little effort as possible, algotrading is not the best option.

P.S.

I have a successful quantitative options strategy. I've been working on it since 10/2021, and profitable since 12/2022, though with a significant drawdown in Q3 2023.
What broker api are u using?
Yes, it‚Äôs the systems that don‚Äôt work that are sold.
I second this
Just another waste of time YouTube ‚Äòguru‚Äô selling programs‚Ä¶right. If he were actually successful, he would not be on YouTube and he would be focusing on his actual algo investments.
Agreed!
Very similar situation for me. I am hoping the same. Good luck to you!
Correct. Test models by data gathered, if not correct outcome reserve judgement and try again. Don't believe anyone unless you can do so yourself.

Not sure about the other replies, but yes, tonnes Algo traders institutional made money consistent and Ive explained in various articles of my - subreddit https://www.reddit.com/r/RossRiskAcademia/s/7AnjcMLeMp -as it's because they exploit the exuberance of retail investors.

Questions feel free to ask.

I won't always have much time - as I build it up as some blend of BSc Accounting/Finance/Quant finance. I'm a retired practitioner.
which platform do u trade on?
Interesting approach, so how is your performance?
I am asking. Thnx.
Did you mean to answer on a different thread? Because this is not about point n click vs APIs.

This is whether you make actual money from algorithmic trading.
Do you allow me to prove you wrong on the 100% with max drawdown of 10%?

being restricted in our PA was a lot more stressful than I realized until I got laid off. after a coupe of years I have gained the confidence to try to make money actively trading again and I am pretty pleased I learned some new asset classes and have made money though I spent a fair amount on "tuition" too. but now I am growing the trading and putting more capital into my own trades and at least for now it feels great  I no longer have to say I am unemployed o raspy weird things when people ask what I am up to
My friend and I do it daily.  I made a few grand ttl in ES and NQ today but my buddy made $28,000. He was way more active and focused on NQ. My best trades were NQ too. Meh, I'll kill it tomorrow. 

We are "pros" but trade our own money so technically = retail. 

We (I) only trade 4 to 8 at a time. Never hold anything overnight. Code is C++. I do not consider putting indicators together an algorithm. It is not.  I use math... lots of intense, sophisticated math.

Why am I reading these reddits? I'm wasting time at a bar so why not?

My quant teacher used to work in Japan in the golden years of Japan‚Äôs economy. He said that they used to hire artists/ right brainers who can interpret the chart in a support/resistance/ ichimoku way/ TA way. And that was even faster than any math calculation out there. He admitted that while he was still doing the calculations, the artists saw through the movement of the charts in an instant ( apart from black swan events )
This simply isn't true
From what I can gather, profitability is possible it you trade strategies that...

* have a relatively long holding period (i.e. not intraday), so that you are not competing with HFT
* have a relatively low capacity, so that you are not competing with traditional and non-HFT quantitative asset managers
> the moment you make significant amounts of money one of the algorithmic trading firms will figure it out

I think you vastly overestimate them and also overestimate the amount of money that is ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù to an individual. Five, ten, fifty, a hundred million dollars isn‚Äôt that noticeable to these corporations.

I do think it would be extremely hard to make money, you can‚Äôt just use the low hanging fruit, you have to have a very atypical idea paired with a lot of luck paired with a vast amount of technical knowledge. But these companies aren‚Äôt nearly as omnipotent as you believe.
This is mostly true but not entirely. Small guys can make good money if you focus on strategies that don't scale. To a quant hedge fund or HFT firm these trades aren't worth the time it takes to monitor them but they can be very meaningful to an individual.
This seems odd. Like if I had an algo successfully trading at most five ES lots, you think an algo firm will work to specifically undermine my algo?
How do the firms have the power to screw people over with the low latency access? They have that kind of reach with the brokerages? Seems highly illegal
No, this is Reddit
Eventually the big players are so few as liquidity dries up it really does feel like a poker game
that's because you aren't trading over $200 mil.   
but also your paying the bid-ask spread even on a $5 market order so idk what your really saying.
My assertion is for most people getting into algo who typically start with a strategies that are not refined for market conditions. Can you make 40% work? Of course! But it means your targets have to overcome the the losses by quite a bit. I find when teaching, over 70% leads to too much ego and blind spots, while less than 50% for too long will make prospects simply quit. I offer 60% because it eases the burden of recovery while quelling ego. Just personal experience. I understand your disagreement if you have a good foundation on both trading and algos. Most in this group are not profitable with their endeavors and looking for help. I would almost assume OP falls in this boat to some degree.
I‚Äôm with you. Mine is a 95% win rate but losses wipe me without risk management.
Let me answer for OP. 

Is the strategy still working as expected? If yes, do nothing. If no, figure out why.

You should understand how the manager is doing relative to how he/she should be doing. But if you're running your own money, all you care about is if the strategies you are running are doing what they are supposed to.

This leads to why backtests are helpful, but not useful. That's a discussion for another day.
Apologies as I am just now seeing this. There are two approaches to me finding any strategy. The first is typically me looking at other strategies and making adjustments. The second would be me layering indicators on a screen and pruning them away when they don't fit my trading type. Most often, it's just a matter of applying the right filter. If you're dealing with too much volatility, add a volatility filter. If you need to figure out the trend, add a trend filter. Same goes with momentum and everything else. Just think outside the box. Sometimes performance can change with something as simple as moving to the 15min rather than the 5 or vise versa.
Some people use higher risk and trade one asset. I cut my trade size and play multiple. Like instead if just the SP500, I will also trade BTC, XAU, and etc. Usually about 15 to 20 for most strats. One algo plays everything since signals only hit maybe twice a month at different times for each asset. Hope that helps.
Reading down and 60% is not a requirement at all. See my reply for my logic [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/s/DuPvsl9Mob)
Not the person you replied to. But yes, win rate doesn't matter. What matters is whether the strategy has positive EV. That's it.
The more crowded trades are - the less it‚Äôll return / higher chance of reversals etc.
the best strategies work no matter what (in the long term) due to stylized facts

For context, I just buy and hold NTSX along with some other etfs and am up 15%. For me the work required for algos is not worth it when a no work buy + hold performs as well. I don't have a math major nor am I part of a 100 person team with a phd doing this for a living. Keep in mind this is reddit, I can say I am up 1000% this year by buying on a full moon and selling when my goldfish hits a button in his fishtank, doesn't mean it's true.
Split my capital according to performance of each strategy, cutting half of positions at the end of day if they are still open
2 years of algo trading, 10+ years or trading and investing
Performance is always before tax, but personally I have 0% tax on capital gain where I live
I‚Äôm not into gambling and need my monthly perf to live
Yes, algorithms I created
I suggest moving away from ETF EOD data. Everyone and there mother is looking for patterns in those prices. It‚Äôs been arbed to hell. You need to look at intraday data in another instrument.
I like to take a look in the charts and news before proceed. Specially close to quarters ends, there are some times that it is better to extend the trade for a week or so, or buy something to profit from dividends, or even avoid an entry point due bad rumors.

The price movement discounts everything but it is purely reactive to events.
By ensuring when I connect my api with my vol box - I always have a pay off diagram. 

To see where I am vulnerable; and I pick up non correlated stocks/assets/synthetic options that percentile wise very much cover my downside (can't be 100) but a very high 98/99% percentile. 

But don't get me wrong; I have this for high liquidity ones. 

Like ITI makes options chain makes no sense to me; so an EWS Algo prevents making that trade based on a collapsed gibbs sampler and a inverse wishart distribution.

So my prior doesn't satisfy the risk/reward - given (prior vs posterior) - is thrown out (by simply taking out top 5-bottom 5 as anamoly).

Yes, of course, go ahead.
Risk per trade is set at 2% with a risk-reward ratio of 1:1.05. The average monthly ROI is 21.2%, excluding NFP gains. When NFP gains are included, the ROI increases to 34.25%. The maximum drawdown is -4%, and if this is hit in a single day, trading stops for the rest of that day (though this rarely occurs). I've never had a losing week or month, though I have experienced a few losing days. Most money is made on high impact news with my algo.
Think it got reposted, the link should be in my profile
Most of my options trades are defined risked. I have a few strategies I deploy. For example one strategy starts the day out with an iron butterfly on the SPX. Then as the market moves (this is where the algo earns its value) I might sell part of the butterfly and make it a credit spread. With a butterfly later with a credit spread I know my max loss. This strategy has a 80% win rate. Average win per trade is about 20% of max risk. On the 20% that go south only a few go to max risk. Certainly have some draw down periods but when the algo is on fire it does well.
I also have some strategies where I use options like a venture capitalist invests in start ups. Based on filters I might buy a handful of put or call options every day. Only risking like $250 per option. Some of these options will go to zero and be worthless. Some will return a little, but a few might return 10x. Risk is always defined by making very small bets.

I think you've hit upon something that took me an embarrassingly long time to understand. Algorithmic trading doesn‚Äôt automatically mean day trading, high-frequency trading (HFT), etc.

The confusion, I believe, arises from institutional algo/HFT users trading based on order flow. To me, this isn‚Äôt speculative risk-taking in the traditional sense; it‚Äôs closer to front-running, as in most cases, the buyer/seller is already lined up before a trade is initiated.

This confusion then trickles down to private traders, who don‚Äôt realise that these algos/HFT strategies aren‚Äôt trading the market per se, but are trading their own customer order flow. Private individuals don‚Äôt have customer order flow to trade against, so when they try to replicate these strategies, they fall flat. I‚Äôm not very popular in r/futuresTrading because I‚Äôm always reminding them that in decades of speaking with banks, clearing members, exchanges, etc., I have never come across a single long-term (5 years+) successful (100k+/yr) day trader‚Äînone.

I‚Äôve even seen people from banks who were considered rock stars crash and burn once they started trading at home. When you‚Äôre outside that bubble of order flow and privileged information, it can be very humbling.

Back to the topic, while stories of supercomputers and HF/microwave links might make great PhD white papers, for the average non-institutional trader, your chances of making money go up exponentially on higher timeframes. It‚Äôs embarrassing, but the little old lady with a share certificate in IBM that she keeps in her sock drawer and checks once a year has a better chance of making money than most futures/FX day traders.

If you‚Äôre a non-institutional trader, drop the obsession with day trading, and absolutely drop the obsession with HFT.
It is possible on shorter time frames
I guess that makes sense but that sounds more like factor investing to me. But I guess potato potata.
This. You‚Äôre not going to win if you go against HFT, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt win if you think more long term.
I have a swing trading bot. it was doing great until about a week ago XD
In the professional context, algo trading tends to mean high speed market making or execution trading algos (vwap, icebergs etc). 

Automated trading/investment strategies would generally be referred to as systematic trading.
Right brained people tend to be better traders than left brained people. The book In The Zone covers this and it‚Äôs fascinating why.
What do you mean by low capacity in this context? Do you mean high capacity trading might end up competing with big players, making it difficult?
This is 100% true. 

Otherwise, there will be no new Quant and HFT funds. 

Everyone starts somewhere. 

$10 million is nothing to these funds but for an individual thats a lot of money
what's an example?
The exchange doesn't care? They make money if people trade? They don't really care if the other side put their servers on the other side of the street and invested lots of money in low latency data processing? At one point goldman Sachs was faster than the exchange itself because there is a slight delay in fully applying transactions after They are visible and goldman sachs was faster in reacting to them than the actual exchange. Also if you would regulate that where do you put the line?
Drawdown is exactly the problem, with a risk of 1:165 for 10 consecutive losses at a 40% win rate and 1:9536 for 10 consecutive losses at a 60% win rate. That‚Äôs why, for most home traders, a 60% win rate makes more sense.
How are you managing risk?
I do understand your point. I usually have two targets in mind: it should be more profitable than buy and hold and protect me from inflation.
benchmarks are actually a huge obsession for institutional allocators not just retail
Have to disagree with this. I mean to some degree I agree in terms of obsession with comparing to benchmarks and backtests. But on the other hand, opportunity cost is a real thing. You say it's fine if the strategy is doing what it's supposed to. In vacuum maybe but realistic if you have a basket of strategies there is always the possibility that you are running one strategy instead of another and the one you're not using would give you greater risk adjusted returns in the current environment. More pragmatically if you're investing a bunch of time and resources in algo trading but your risk adjusted returns are lower than the S&P then why bother? You might as well buy and hold SPY at that point...
Benchmarks are there so you don't waste your time. If your strategy doesn't do as well as some benchmark, then invest in that benchmark instead
You pretty much just summed up my approach. It‚Äôs always nice to know the way I approach something isn‚Äôt crazy.
Yes, it makes sense. If you deploy your strategy across multiple assets you can then only trade the best setups. Thank you.
Thank you.
Like all things in life: EV, Std Dev
positive skewness often accompanies a low win rate, its nothing to shy away from as long as you have other positively skewed and uncorrelated alphas
thanks
Fair enough
How long have you been at this if you don't mind me asking?
It revolves around the halving pretty consistently (lag back and forth of around 6 months generally for specific sub-cycles) take 10 minutes to draw out the ATHs in the four years cycle and you'll notice they're very close in time distance (literally exact same day distance for last few)
i'm on this sub right now because i just discovered algo trading like 3 hours ago and want to learn more (dabbled with crypto since 2012 on and off and understand basic TA yada yada), and "there looks like pattern" had me dying

only reason I was able to make considerable profit (on relatively small investments) back then was because I used TradingView, slapped some wavy lines and random indicators that looked cool on some random new cryptos that will "totally revolutionary the world of finance" (not) and said "looks neat, place buy"

I wish I got this advice three years ago. You could have saved me countless hours of efforts and a boat load of money.


For many people, me included, a decent portfolio of cleverly selected ETFs and some hedging is the way to go. Yet people will keep chasing rainbows and for what?


I could dump my money to SPY beginning of this year and make a lot of money. Instead I traded every single day and to float around break even. F this. I‚Äôm going static long and doing the scalping on the side from now on
Did the 10 year help in algo trading ? I am also trying to get into it but I have a cs background and free time.
PR?
Can you share your strategies? Can I dm?
I thought we all learn from reading the Market Wizards books that there are many, many different ways of being successful at trading.

You obviously have a successful intraday strategy, I wish I had one too. I've worked with intraday data looking for systems but I have had much more success finding systems using EOD data, so that has been my focus.

And surprisingly, there are many repeating patterns to be found using daily OHLC data. Jaffray Woodriff, a Hedge Fund Market Wizard, has been very successful finding patterns in secondary variables derived from just daily OHLC data.
Great information. I‚Äôm newer to the space, and I think I have found alpha and edge in my strategy, but I‚Äôm 100% heads down on risk management at the moment. Would you say in your experience that ‚Äúdiversification across assets/sectors‚Äù is ranked high for you when it comes to minimizing risk and max drawdowns?

Ah okay. Makes sense.
Are they real ALGORITHMS or just a few indicators strung together in a bogus trading program... that u call algos? 

This is the correct sub for real algos but from what I have seen, 99% of the tools on Reddit think 2 fkg moving averages working at the same time = an algorithm.

So beware people...  !!
I transfer money out of my account to my bank every month. I don't want to be left holding the bag for a failed broker/FCM... or getting screwed by a jagoff like John Corzine fleecing his clients. 

Therefore, I usually start each month with 30k. My avg risk per trade is $1,200. My WR is ~ 68% each month.
Financial futures only. 

No stocks. No options. No crypto.


Yes, I believe the higher timeframes can be a better option. I'm sure these institutions are farming money through their HFT bots though.
To professionals algo generally means speed and execution trading. And systematic trading would be automated rules that run on longer time frames and are trying to take directional risk.
It gets better with hedging. Let's say you have phone location data. You could long hotels in areas with high traffic and short hotels in areas with low traffic. This would be a way of isolating yourself from the general "hotel factor" and seeking to gain pure and direct exposure to your alpha (phone data).
Until the pullback?
Why?
Yes. Big players need to move tens of millions to billions of dollars, so they are only looking for high capacity strategies. If you avoid these, then you won't be competing with them. I think.
good point! also important to think about the fact that with equal TP, the SL for 40% WR will be much lower than for 60%. So 10 losses in a row for 40% WR and 60% WR will yield much different drawdowns.
Having a low percentage works in a strategy when the highs overcome the previous losses. But for the average trader, I just want them to beat "buy and hold" or a simple coin toss.
Machine learning algo that indicates when to close mainly
That's totally fine. You have to understand that those are completely different mandates, though. A strategy can do neither of those things, but when added to a portfolio, can make it more effective for both.
No, they are a huge obsession for the boards, not the managers.
See above "is it running as expected" 

"should I replace it with another strategy" is an entirely different question.
100% agree. I‚Äôm outpacing the S&P 500 by a fairly wide margin, and that is my main benchmark. If I‚Äôm not beating that significantly with my tax adjusted net profit, I‚Äôm not going to bother trading.
It's hard to make generalizations, but it really depends on the mandate, the asset class, and the strategy. 

I know PMs that don't even check the market. I also know some that check it religiously. It really just depends.
We are all here for social discourse and learning... at least in my mind.

If you are uncertain about risk management; draw (on paper); helps cognitive wise; your strategy; even if it contains 33 assets. 

You will see exactly what move, where, at what point, your exposed to (potential) losses. Right there - is the gap (if for example a fixed loss like a bond that goes bankrupt) or infinite - you seek a opposing trade to offset that. Bit old school but it works.

Yep, didn‚Äôt catch that one. While it‚Äôs a little disappointing, I‚Äôm fine with it. It‚Äôs not a perfect algorithm. So far I‚Äôm out a little bit ahead anyway.
Gotcha, that‚Äôs a good point.
How big are your losers in comparison to your winners?
I like it, thanks for the insights! 

I do have a trade report that I've automated to pull:  
1. Trade history  
2. P/L for each trade  
3. Indicators settings that applied to each trade  
4. Timestamp of each trade

I've spend some time, but I think I need to spend much more time on analyzing the data...which times and days do I experience the biggest gains and losses, what market conditions, etc.

As you stated, I need to have a mixed bag of financial instruments that may be able to offset losses with another instrument. I hadn't thought of that before since I've been so focused on development and getting my code to work properly. I'll see what I can find and try to implement what you've suggested.

Thanks!
Fair
Alright il be in touch
An automated strategy can be, again, 2 moving averages from the 1990s. Big deal.  

What types of algorithms are you using?  I don't care about the code, just the category of algo.
Yeah, the size even caught some of us out who had expected it. I‚Äôm looking at creating a model, so would be interested in knowing how complex is your model is and how you went about creating it please?
Each win is about 3% of the max loss. So it‚Äôs pretty important my code does what it needs to do. I lost about 60-70% of my portfolio before I wrote it.
[deleted]
Not super complex. Rules based in python. I use vulr to run the python script using chron jobs that does decision making periodically throughout the day. I have a logging system locally using sqllite.
Once again you have not answered my question.  Red flags, anyone?

Do you know what a random forest tree algorithm is?

I'll wait for you to Google it.
Big loss due to coding error
Early this month I had a coding error in a safety feature. The feature checks if there are open positions and closes them; however, I was running on multiple threads. So I had this ballooning position just opening and closing every minute during a volatile period. I ended up losing over 40k.
This is a relatively new system I've been running since December. Luckily, I was up 200k for the year until the loss. I was slightly on tilt the nextday, and upped my risk, which resulted in another 13k loss... I'm not on tilt anymore.

Anyone else lose/win due to dumb coding errors?
I once doubled my tiny starter account due to a bug that over leveraged my account during a ride up, all while I slept.

Good bug, bummed I had to fix it
When I wrote my first bot like 3 years ago I somehow flipped the buy/sell signals (go short on buy, go long on sell) and lost a couple hundo in like 15 mins
Sounds like you're ready for Knight Capital.
Lucky it wasn't a 440 million dollar bug :)

https://www.henricodolfing.com/2019/06/project-failure-case-study-knight-capital.html?m=1

(The classic example of why you don't run unsupervised trading without a dumb-and-reliable-as-a-rock killswitch)
The very first time I turned on a bot, it was trading Bitcoin in 2015. It happily alternated buy and sell orders like a machine gun, losing the spread (of fortunately only a penny) every pair of trades.
I'm using yfinance. It takes some time to update open quotes when the market opens. I figured the tickers which are yet to update appear with nulls, so I dropped all na values. But apparently some values which are yet to update appear with yesterday's quotes. Lost couple hundred bucks on this error, nothing major, but still
I use single thread for each trade. Different threads for different stocks and algos to avoid the problem op had.

I had a bug once where broker returned error and did not generate order id on sell order ( broker issue) but the order was going through.
So i ended up short selling the stock continuously till balance was 0 and broker was throwing exception.
I use discord to deliver fail switch  which turned off the algo.
Broker did support acceptance of unique id for individual order which i wasn‚Äôt using earlier(broker will not accept order with same unique id if already accepted). Hard lesson learned.
What language are you using? 

If I were you I would keep the data for when this happened and write an integration test around this bug.
Lmao this exact thing happened to me yesterday, I have some cool down code on mine that waits 5 minutes before entering another trade. 

It made a trade within 2 minutes of the last and I was going what in the world is going on. It shouldn't be doing that. So I moved a couple things around and stupidly pushed to production... It completely removed my safety, 12 trades just opening and closing within a matter of two seconds and left me with a big position in the wrong direction. 

Luckily it was on a forward testing account, I won't be making that mistake again.

My problem was that I was thinking the code was in seconds so I was multiplying by 60 and 5 to get five minutes. I took another look at the coding resources and it was in MILLISECONDS. Doi! So that was my original problem, everything fixed and the cool down has been reinserted in the correct place. 

The worst thing for me is just creating an anomaly in my data, but that's ok, that's why we test.

Since it was in a paper account though it was honestly hilarious hearing all of those orders go out. Sorry to hear that you actually suffered some damage from what happened with you. 


For you, I'm not sure exactly what happened but I have two safeguards related to stop losses. I try to have a limit but I also have a contingency that says if the price is a certain amount PAST my stop limit then cancel the stop limit and place a stop market. That way even though it may be a little more painful I'm making sure that orders are closing out. That at least saved me with the position size being too big, but the loss was way bigger than it should've been.

Maybe something to consider.
A simple way to prevent/limit such cases: activate a broker side max loss. That handles such cases very effectively.

Many algo traders have had these errors - and they will always sound incredibly dumb to discretionary traders :)
Up 200k since December? Jesus wtf am I doing wrong lol
Hey AngerSharks1, 

I feel your pain. I lost 19k while I slept a few months ago. I was surprised how unemotional I was about it. The only thing I cared about was identifying the problem and fixing it. It had back tested with replay data for two years. 

  
Since there are many here spending a great deal of time in the pursuit of a profitable algo would you be willing to share the basic premise of your strategy with us?  Enough for those who are truly dedicated to algo development might reconstruct your strategy in their own algo/platform etc. 

Thank you for sharing your "lost (money) and found (fix)" story with us in any case. It's good for many here including myself to hear the good and the bad in algo coding. 

  
:-)
Had a few issues like this when I was first developing my bot.  Ended up setting up a simple website that displays a lot of metrics that update in real time.  Being able to see all open buys/sells and recent fills really helped me catch new issues within minutes of them occurring.

Best part was that the website itself only took me 2 or so hours to fully setup.  Socket.io made it so easy to send data from the bot to the web server and then to the webpage.  Sure the site isn‚Äôt pretty, but I‚Äôm the only one who sees it so I don‚Äôt really care.
When you are making 200k, you didn‚Äôt post to share tips on how to help others. But when you lose, you ask for help. üòÇ
Do you have a background in programming? There is a semaphore object you can use to prevent that. You should look into async for algo trading it's a lot safer then using threads and can be used to solve io bounding.
*Always have 100% visibility open positions and orders*  And testing asyncs and multithreaded, you really have to focus.

(manual trading but ... ) somebody i know was trading aggresive size on a FOMC type day when he was interrupted by a family call and drove away for 20 minutes.  When he came back, forgotten  position down $68k.
ah misery loves company. sorry man, sucks.
I have considered adding some kind of protection against catastrophic failure. Something like ‚Äúclose all positions and stop trading, if dd is more than 20% in the last 8 hours‚Äù. Anyone having similar mechanisms?
What platform do you use for your algo?
No bots live yet, but a question for you. Before you put your bot live, were you not coming up with failure modes (either actually happening ones or dreamy up ones) and programming around that?
Don't forget Knight Capital. One little coding mistake lost them $440 million in an hour.


https://www.henricodolfing.com/2019/06/project-failure-case-study-knight-capital.html
Hindsight is always 20/20, truer words were never spoken. But yes, always keep some sort of stop-loss to protect yourself. The most simple risk-management we can do.
When moving from paper trading to live, I find my code has millions of tiny errors that only come up when actually trading and I only find given enough time, since I'm swing trading. It makes me want to switch from python to typescript
good learning opportunity in two ways (coding and being on tilt), so you're ahead.
I think what you said is good, I think you're absolutely right, the code written by humans is unreliable because humans always make mistakes, but machines don't. If code can be generated through visualization tools, the error rate will be reduced to a very low level, or even no errors at all. Here I would like to recommend a tool I developed,¬†[Pineify](https://pineify.app/?utm_medium=reddit)¬†, a pinescript indicator visualization editor.
Dam I would write so many tests on prod code and use ci/cd..do ppl here really just write scripts and run it live?
Sorry this is not related to your post. You got any tips for the newbies like on where to focus first or any general tips. Cheers
All the time.

Less of a bug and more of realizing the real world effect. Running a momentum strategy but changed the time period to reduce compute for other strategies, not realizing that would drastically change +200 positions at market open. Slippage was about 1% of the portfolio.
Ouch thats a lot of money to lose. What was the error if you dont mind me asking?
Honestly I think when most of us here have big losses,  they are due to coding features, not errors. Self included.

Also, 200k YTD?

https://youtu.be/7NxQXJhgwTY?si=q357AWbvPhFcWP5N
Not to judge but looks like a case where a mistake of manual trading (reason why automate used is not to get emotional and same emotion is coded or change in code in edge cases) bug might not be a technical term since it looks like a miss in coding a case then unusual behaviuourby a unsupervised ML alogo...do u mind giving more details of your analysis of why this loss might have happened?
*knight capital group has entered the chat*
Dumb question. What brokerage do you use that allows API trades?
Welcome to the mutex lock
I was planning on running integration tests on my system before running but this reminded me I need to also test race conditions. Really sorry to hear that
You're not alone. Add tests to your code.
Have you considered testing it?
I wish I could write such a program!
Happened few times for me. Now before release of major update testing it firstly on demo account for a week.
lol, thats too bad
Happened to me lol
Tough L - I think its best to back test this on a live paper trading account to avoid this and then move over to real money
Losses and gains are our life :)
Just last week I found a bug in my latest algo where the trailing SL was not getting updated properly. End result was very low profit for few weeks.
yes, forgot to fixate the sell price, so the bot was chasing the current price more and more into loss. Luckily it was still in the testing mode and lost only like hundred bucks
This is a fear every time I make an update...  I also worry about the robot getting duped by flash deviations from the fair-market price.  

Should probably have more circuit-breakers installed, but I do want the program to keep running when the market is acting crazy.
What strategy are you running to make 200k/year ?
Would love some tips and advices, I m making 0$ üò≠
I‚Äôve lost a lot of money due to weak risk management and silly coding errors. You‚Äôll bounce back in no time, cheers
What language are you using to code?
What advice do you have for an economist/mathematician that has backtested and live paper traded a python scripted bot that hasnt lost on any backtest starting at the dotcom bubble, as well, every daily call options trade in over a month?
You didn't see this in paper trading?
So you were just missing a lock, it sounds like? I know Python doesn‚Äôt have true parallelism so that shouldn‚Äôt be an issue in Python concurrency?
Sounds like a feature
Best kind of bug.
Bed Bug
Bro ..  Definitely a feature
A heads or tails bug
Any causality there?
The amnt of regulation now in place because of those 12 minutes is insane.
Thank you for posting that link; I never knew the back story to that event.
There is a lot of great info to glean from this piece, thanks for posting!  My last gig in software used all of the recommended devops practices with continuous delivery and every team was full stack including test and deployment automation engineering.  Essential for a large and distributed workforce but also worth it for our little bespoke algo trading ops.
Does yfinance now work normally? Late last year I was trying to use it for some projects but yahoo had apparently blocked it from working.
What broker were you using?
What does forward testing mean? Sorry, im new to this field and finding my feet.
You dont know if that person leveraged their entire mortgage and childrens education fund on a 100x leverage bitcoin etf or is playing with 200m of company money and is underperforming
Don‚Äôt believe everything on the internet lol. OPs account has had 5 post in 10 years and off the sudden he posts with an unbelievable story. 

We‚Äôre seeing this on all subs. A dormant account posts a self story that isn‚Äôt likely and then asks the community for their stories. Easy way to fake karma
What if someone had a 99.9999% successful algorithm. If it took them years of research and patience to realize it but cant run it themselves with real money, how can they share that revelation? Sharing that formula could simply be used by someone else to get rich and the founder being left out.
Yeah, I've been meaning to do this, maybe just a simple streamlit dashboard.
Not for help, the problem is fixed. Just to make people aware that there are issues that arise that aren't accounted for on back tests. I have been fortunate and am actually up for the month now despite the loss.
You dont have to worry its plainly obvious you cant be helped anyway
Schedule a function that periodically checks your balance every T amount of time, if things start going south, you liquidate all open positions and stop the bot, and you can even send a notification to yourself.
I trade futures and, for some reason, decided to build out the application using FIX APi.
Yeah, I didn't do a good job with unit tests. I guess it took me a loss to take it serious. Been just rushing to productionalize, expand and research.
How many lines of code does your python script use?
Yeah dumb over confidence.
Most common brokers have APIs
Sorry, that just sounds like you have a data leak. But if your live paper trading is going well, then launch, you'll find out soon enough. Best of luck.
Public void doubleMoney(double scrilla)
Cause: wrote bad software.
Effect: lost $200 in 15 mins lol
Alpaca
Nah you're good. It's just testing it on a live paper trading account.
Not dormant, just a lurker. But you're right, don't believe everything you read. It's taken me years of work to get where im at. And I don't claim I can help anyone reach profitability. Just keep at it, learn, it takes time. I clearly have more to learn.
Makes me feel better about my 50 000% yearly return strategy that is only profitable in back tests ü•≤
Yea you are so helpful that you have to make 3 same posts on the same sub. Thanks for being so ‚Äúhelpful‚Äù.
This is the last resort safe guard against catastrophic errors, you should also have stop loss, and other risk management strategies, on each trade level!
 Nice. How long was it in development before it was profitable? I also trade futures, currently have a bitcoin bot using TradingView but considering NinjaTrader for chart trading and a futures algo. Or quantconnect. I‚Äôm a lot more comfortable with python (do it for work)
Unit tests usually don't help with races that you see in multi-thread code.  It's a lot easier to put your risk checks in a spinpock-protected object that gives a dumb but fast response.
I dont do unit tests as well (am eager to get my theory implemented so I can do functional tests. But, I will functional test for long time and through different conditions.
About 4000, including various utils and manual functions.  
But I already went ahead and rewrote it in Typescript (excluding the number crunching), which resulted in about 2000 lines. Goodbye errors.
Sounds like some great software once you fixed that bug. Which islands are you planning to buy?
Did you reach out to alpaca? How did they respond. It makes sense to handle it, but it also shouldn‚Äôt be possible. If they are telling you they didn‚Äôt make a trade and they did, they should be covering it in my opinion.
What do you trade
They were "auto deleted." I guess they posted when I hit some quota. Quit being so salty guy.
Is tradeview free to start? I want to see if there is any alternative.

I have been using alpaca + TD and python.
Dint bother coz i din‚Äôt have a big loss.
It was a grey area where it was throwing exception and not saying that they dint make the trade. ( can‚Äôt remember the exception)
At the same time, i agree with you as it‚Äôs not like they said that they did make the trade
Well I‚Äôm glad you asked, join my trading discord and for a small monthly fee I will teach you how to be successful!
Lmao they hate you cause you making stacks and they ain't doing shit
Just have a net worth of 50mil and buy VOO
