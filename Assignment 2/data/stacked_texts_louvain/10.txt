1930s to 1970s 
The group was founded in 1935 broadcasting from radio station KFYO AMKFYO in Lubbock Texas and took the name in 1936 when they moved to WBAP AMWBAP in Fort Worthrefref  The original members sang together all the way to 1955 when Dad Carter retired later passing away in 1963 followed by Jim in 1971  Sons Eddie and Roy Carter stepped in to sing tenor and bass respectively which began the tradition of Carter siblings children and eventually grandchildren joining the Gang

By the mid1970s the group was still touring parttime but felt a lack of support from the label they had recorded for during the previous three decades  Columbia had stopped servicing their songs to radio thus airplay had become nonexistent The decision was eventually made to move on from Columbia in the interest of rebuilding the group to a position akin to what it had enjoyed in years past To that end in 1979 they began recording for Copperfield Records and remained with that label for several years refBob Terrell The Chuck Wagon Gang A Legend Lives On 1990ref

1980s to Present Day
After its relationship with Copperfield Records ended the Chuck Wagon Gang began recording for Associated Artists  It was during this era that the group took advantage of its renewed popularity and in keeping with the gospel sounds of the time added a piano player to the lineup for live concerts  Fans responded positively to this sound eventually culminating in the Gang receiving the Best Gospel Group in Country Music award at the Music City News Awards in 1988 refBob Terrell The Chuck Wagon Gang A Legend Lives On 1990ref

Roy approached Annas granddaughter Shaye in 1993 asking her to assume the responsibility of singing soprano upon the retirement of member Debbie Trusty  Shaye accepted Roys offer and sang soprano with the Gang until the retirement of alto singer Ruth Ellen Carter Yates a few years later when she moved to her current position of alto singer   Roy subsequently retired bringing about a new era for the Gang in which none of Dad Carters children were members  As the 21st century dawned the Gang sought to return to its origins paring its sound back to the beautiful simplicity of fourpart harmony accompanied by a single guitar  Once again fans responded positively  As of 2024 the Gang records for Crossroads Label Group Source
