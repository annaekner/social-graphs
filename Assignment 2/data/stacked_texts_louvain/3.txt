Home Frees styling as a country group is relatively recent Before Foust joined the group Home Free was an allpurpose a cappella group singing in a wide variety of styles of which country was only a minor one With the additions of Foust and Brown the group moved more in the direction of country and found that audiences responded well to it Home Free had auditioned three times for The SingOff without Foust and Brown and not been accepted When auditioning for the The SingOff season 4fourth season they made a conscious decision to style themselves as a country group In an interview Brown said this identity is what grabbed the attention of The SingOffs casting director who said You guys really fit something we dont haveref nameginger

Patrick Kevin Skinnerrefref born February 25 1974 is an American country music singer from the Jackson Purchase region of Kentucky He is the winner of the Americas Got Talent season 4fourth season of Americas Got Talent

 Early life and career 
Skinner is from the Dublin community of Graves County KentuckyGraves County Kentucky and started playing the guitar when he was 12 years old He has been playing writing and singing ever since he learned the art of music from his musician father Joe who is a fan of Hank Williams Skinner is divorced and has two children a daughter and a son He has worked as a chicken catcher for several years and claims to have caught with his friends up to 60000 chickens in one night

 Americas Got Talent 

 Audition 
Skinner performed in a live audition on the August 4 2009 episode of Americas Got Talent He became a fan favorite in the show after his performance of Garth Brooks If Tomorrow Never Comes while strumming his guitar Judges Piers Morgan Sharon Osbourne and David Hasselhoff all voted Yes sending him to the Vegas Round

 Vegas Round 
Skinner then appeared without performing in the Vegas Round His audition was strong enough for the judges to send him to the Quarterfinals in Episode 411

 Quarterfinals 
His Week 1 Quarterfinals performance in Episode 413 consisted of singing Bob Dylans Make You Feel My Love while playing the guitar Kevin received enough votes to be sent to the Semifinals in Episode 414 instead of Mosaic

 Semifinals 
The Week 1 Semifinals performance in Episode 421 consisted of Skinner guitar playing and singing Always On My Mind by Brenda Lee Piers Morgan gave him a standing ovation saying that singing from the heart and soul with real raw emotion is the whole story about him while the two of them were both tearyeyed as well as the audience in which Kevin was reminded that he had the ability to move an audience in a way that Piers never saw on AGT before concluding that Kevin is one of his favorites to win the season

In the end Kevin received enough votes to be sent to the Finals in Episode 422 instead of Acrodunk basketball trampoline dance group

 Finals 
Later in the Finals Skinners performance in Episode 425 consisted of singing his rendition of Aerosmiths I Dont Want to Miss a Thing while playing his guitar and having a backup band and vocals

Judge Piers said the rendition wasnt perfect and had a missed odd note with little flattened places but described the moment as the point of Skinners journey as a rough diamond needing professional training But remembering the words on how Hasselhoff described Skinner Piers said that he was what the show was created for while being unemployed and catching chickens the past year at that time But despite those obstacles it was a better way for America itself to get out of its recession and have Skinner compete in the show

Even though Sharon said that he doesnt have the best voice in the contest she reminded Kevin that he does not need to sound perfect while describing him as one of the greatest and unique icons similar to Johnny Cash Bob Dylan Mick Jagger and Lou Reed all of whom did not need to have the perfect voices but are all such unique individuals

The judges once again all gave him standing ovations

 Finale 
Kevin Skinner received enough votes to be included in the Top 5 in Episode 426 instead of Drew Stevyns Kevin was revealed to have competed in first place in the competition that same night in front of Barbara Padilla who was runner up Recycled Percussion in third place The Texas Tenors in fourth and The Voices of Glory in fifth winning one million dollars and a headline show in Las Vegas

 Trivia 
During AGTs 10 Year Anniversary Special on July 29 2015 Piers Morgan stated that Kevin Skinner was his favorite act

Exile formerly the Exiles is an American band founded in Richmond Kentucky in 1963 The band consists of JP Pennington lead vocals lead guitar Les Taylor singerLes Taylor guitar lead and background vocals Sonny LeMaire bass guitar background vocals Marlon Hargis keyboards and Steve Goetzman drums With a founding membership including original lead singer Jimmy Stokley the band played cover songs and local events in the state of Kentucky for a number of years before becoming a backing band on the touring revue Caravan of Stars After a series of failed singles on various labels Exile achieved mainstream success in 1978 with Kiss You All Over a numberone single on the Billboard magazineBillboard Hot 100 This iteration of the band mostly played soft rock and pop music

After Stokley was fired due to his declining health Mark Gray singerMark Gray and Taylor joined as vocalists also contributing on keyboard and guitar respectively However Gray departed after only three years to begin a solo career Exile began a transition to country music in the beginning of the 1980s with Pennington and Taylor as vocalists alongside LeMaire Hargis and Goetzman This lineup was featured on their 1983 album Exile 1983 Exile albumExile their first as a country band and their first on Epic Records Between then and 1987 Exile had ten numberone singles on the Billboard magazineBillboard Hot Country Songs charts as well as a numberone country album with Kentucky Hearts in 1984

Hargis Pennington and Taylor left the band between 1987 and 1989 with LeMaire and multiinstrumentalist Paul Martin alternating on lead vocals for two albums on Arista Nashville between 1990 and 1991 During the early 1990s both Pennington and Taylor recorded as solo artists Exile disbanded in 1995 after which LeMaire recorded one album in the band Burnin Daylight and began writing songs for other artists Individual members of Exile played a number of informal shows between the late 1990s and the beginning of the 21st century but the early1980s lineup did not reestablish until 2008 Exile has continued to tour and record under this lineup ever since

Exiles sound is defined by vocal harmony with rock and pop influences Most of their country music releases were cowritten by Taylor and Pennington and most of their country albums feature the band playing all the instruments by themselves instead of using session musicians Songs of theirs have also been covered by Alabama bandAlabama Huey Lewis and the News Dave  Sugar and the Forester Sisters and LeMaire has written songs for Restless Heart Diamond Rio and Clay Walker

History
Exile was founded in Richmond Kentucky in 1963 as the Exilesref nameallmusicrefref namevirginref by a group of students attending Madison High School Richmond KentuckyMadison High School Randy Westbrook in the book 50 Years of Exile The Story of a Band in Transition describes the bands origins as murky due to conflicting accounts among early members According to him founding drummer Mack Davenport played high school dances in the band Kings of Rhythm Davenport recalled this band consisting of Paul Smith Jr on bass guitar Doug Jones on lead guitar Ronnie Hall on vocals Doug Begley on saxophone and Billy Luxon on trumpet They played jazz soul musicsoul and blues After an unknown number of performances this group became the Fascinations which consisted of Davenport Smith Luxon Jones and percussionist Eddie Rhodus with Hall and Jimmy Stokley both providing vocals Rhodus died in a car accident and Jones departed in 1963 at which point according to Westbrook the five remaining members dissolved that band and founded the Exilesref nameallmusic They entered a local contest with a recording session as its grand prize The Exiles lost to a band called the Digits although after the competition Jones left for undisclosed reasons and the other members recruited the Digitss guitarist Mike Howard to take his place The name the Exiles was inspired by the Cuban exodus or exile of Cubans to the United States following the Cuban Revolution

Originally Stokley and Hall alternated as lead vocalists However the other band members thought Stokley was much more dynamic and fired Hall in 1964 JP Pennington joined soon after he was previously in a local band called the Le Sabers whose lead singer Leroy Pullins was later known for his 1966 novelty hit Im a Nut The Exiles persuaded Pennington to play bass guitar allowing Smith to switch to rhythm guitar They performed publicly for the first time in 1964 at IrvineMcDowell Park in Richmond with a lineup consisting of Stokley Howard Smith Davenport Pennington and Luxon Most of their other early performances were at sock hops and high school dances where they covered artists such as the Temptations and James Brown Stokley wanted the band to have a keyboardist and selected Buzz Cornelison who had briefly played with the Kings of Rhythm After Cornelison joined the band began performing local gigs throughout Kentucky

One of the bands recurring gigs was at a youth center in Martin Kentucky whose owner David Grigsby encouraged the Exiles to submit a demo musicdemo to Nashville radio station WLAC disc jockey John Richbourg who used the name John R Grigsby on air Richbourg arranged for the band to record their first single in 1965 on Jimbo Records The Answer to Her Prayers a song that Smith wrote They performed a number of gigs at a nightclub in Richmond called Specks which led to them becoming the house band there As Luxon Pennington Cornelison and Howard all contributed backing vocals the Exiles began incorporating cover songs with more vocal harmony such as the Young Rascals and the Beach Boys They also covered soul music to take advantage of Stokleys raspy voice which Westbrook compared to Wilson Pickett Pennington quit the Exiles in 1965 as he was only 16 at the time and his parents thought he was too young to be in a band Following Penningtons departure Smith reverted to bassist creating a sixpiece lineup with Howard Davenport Luxon Stokley and Cornelison

19651972 Caravan of Stars and early singles
In late 1965 Richbourg took the band to Nashville to record material he had selected and produced including the single Alligator Time It featured double entendre lyrics and spokenword adlibs The single was credited to Jimmy Stokley and the Exiles and was issued through Monument Recordsrefref Grigsby also contacted Peggy Rogers a manager for radio and television host Dick Clark After seeing the band perform at Specks she encouraged them to travel to Cincinnati Music Hall in Cincinnati Ohio to accompany Lou Christie at a stop on Clarks Caravan of Stars touring revue The Exiles rehearsed with female backing vocalists for a performance of his single Lightnin Strikes During rehearsal Cornelison noted the vocalists had been singing wrong notes and taught them the correct melody As Christie was not present during rehearsals he did not notice this correction until the performance Afterward he asked who had corrected the arrangement when Cornelison stated he was responsible Christie asked him to write down the correct notes a move that impressed Rogers

In 1966 Rogers asked the Exiles to accompany a Caravan of Stars show at Stoll Field in Lexington Kentucky after a truck delivering instruments to the show broke down They continued to tour on Caravan of Stars throughout October and November backing acts such as the Yardbirds John Caldwell a Caravan of Stars manager encouraged the band to travel to New York City in 1967 to record for Date Records These featured the Exiles solely as vocalists with the instruments played entirely by session musicians They recorded a cover of the Young Rascalss What Is the Reason as well as the originals Come Out Come Out Whoever You Are and Id Love to Give My Love Away None of these singles were successful Caldwell also asked the band to move to New York City at this point Cornelison refused and quit as he wanted to rejoin college and study musical theater He was replaced by Bernie Faulkner who had played with them at Specks In addition to the keyboard Faulkner contributed on guitar and saxophone Smith was Conscriptiondrafted after the bands move to New York City leaving the Exiles without a bass player He was briefly replaced by Larry Davis whom the other members met while in New York but he quickly left due to personality conflicts As a result Howard contacted Pennington and successfully asked him to rejoin After three months in New York the Exiles returned to Kentucky and resumed performing at Specks

Due to their success backing Caravan of Stars they were invited to do so again in 1967 and 1968 They performed twelve minutes of cover songs as an opening act before accompanying other acts on the bill such as Freddy Cannon Brian Hyland and Paul Revere and the Raiders After the 1968 tour ended they were contacted by talent agent Mark Alan who invited them to return to New York for another session with Date Records Unlike the previous session they were allowed to play their own instruments These sessions resulted in one unsuccessful single Mary on the Beach The band was dissatisfied with their living conditions in New York and left again in early 1969 Soon afterward Howard was also drafted and served in Vietnam for eleven months He declined to rejoin as he was disappointed by the second trip to New York and the lack of original material in the bands repertoire Howard became a construction worker and then worked in a post office before retiring in 2009 Cornelison then rejoined after being turned down for a job at a lounge in northern Kentucky As a result the Exiles did not have a lead guitarist at this point instead relying on both Cornelison and Faulkner as keyboardists In addition Cornelison played trumpet while Faulkner also played saxophone and rhythm guitar

Alan booked the Exiles as an opening act for Tommy James and the Shondells at a show in Baton Rouge Louisiana in 1969 Lead singer Tommy James invited them to travel to New York a third time as he wanted them to record a song he had written titled Church Street Soul Revival Pennington alternated with James on lead guitar in addition to his usual role as bassist The song was released in 1969 on Columbia Records and became the bands first chart entry making number four on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chartsref namewhitburn2010 In 1970 the band was recommended to songwriter and producer Buddy Buie who also wanted to record a song with them This song Put Your Hands Together featured the Exiles accompanied by the Atlanta Rhythm Section of which Buie was their manager producer  cosongwriter As this song was also unsuccessful the band began expressing disappointment with Alans management In addition Pennington had begun writing original songs but Stokley and Cornelison were not interested in writing songs and the original material proved unpopular in concerts Davenport quit in late 1971 or late 1972 attributing his departure to the bands continued lack of success He went on to become a bartender and was replaced on drums by Bobby Johns Pennington left a second time in 1972 as he wanted to move to California with his cousin While the other band members expressed a desire to break up they remained together at Stokleys insistence and Johns recruited guitarist Kenny Weir and bassist Bill Kennon Pennington returned to the Exiles after only a few months assuming the role of guitarist this time As a result Kennon departed and Weir switched to bass Westbrook noted that this lineup allowed a more hard rock sound in addition to the existing vocal harmonies as well as the presence of Faulkners saxophone and Cornelison and Luxons trumpets for a sound more intricate than what was expected from the average bar band

Pop music career
19721975 Wooden Nickel Records
In 1972 the band was offered a recording contract by Chicagobased Wooden Nickel Records As they thought the Exiles sounded dated the band shortened its name to Exile Their first Wooden Nickel album the selftitled Exile was released in 1973 Wooden Nickel coowner Bill Traut served as producer He allowed the band to perform all of the instruments and vocals by themselves except for some vocal overdubbing the entire album was recorded in only one take Despite this Traut selected most of the material which included covers of Seals and Crofts Van Morrison and Todd Rundgren and he wanted the band to perform in a blueeyed soul style The album included only two original songs Pennington wrote Do What You Think You Should while he Stokley and Traut cowrote Hold Tight Woman Wooden Nickel released a second album in late 1973 titled Stage Pass It included two songs written by Pennington and one by Johns while the rest of the album was once more composed of cover songs Among the covers was one of the Beatless We Can Work It Out arranged by Cornelison Also included was a live recording of Jeff Becks New WaysTrain Train which featured a number of solos from all members Both of the Wooden Nickel albums were unsuccessful commercially and the label dropped the band by years end

Following their departure from Wooden Nickel the band lost three members in quick succession Faulkner left in late 1973 due to disillusionment over the failure of the Wooden Nickel releases and began working at Lemco Studios a recording studio in Lexington Kentucky He also released one single in 1983 as a member of the country music band Hazard Weir left at an unknown point prior to late 1974 according to Westbrook neither Cornelison nor Pennington could remember why Weir exited the band Soon after departing Exile Weir died in a car accident Danny Williams replaced Weir on bass guitar in 1974 Luxon quit around the time Williams joined citing the lack of horn parts on the Wooden Nickel albums He went on to own a nightclub in Richmond until he sold it in 1993 Taking Faulkners place on keyboards was Marlon Hargis a native of Somerset Kentucky He had become acquainted with Exile through his work as a keyboardist at Lemco Studios where members of Exile had joined in on recording commercials demos and country music albums by local artists

19751978 Try It On and Kiss You All Over

By the mid1970s the bandat the time composed of Stokley Pennington Cornelison Hargis Williams and Johnshad moved back to Lexington Kentucky They recorded a number of demos in an attempt to secure another recording contract One such demo was submitted to Mike Chapman an Australian record producer who was looking to begin working with American artistsref namefairyref Working with Chapman the band recorded a disco song called Try It On for Atco Records which charted at number 97 on the Billboard Hot 100Billboard Hot 100 in 1977 As the song was not successful Johns quit around the time of its release and was replaced by Steve Goetzman who at the time was Penningtons roommate Johns later joined the rock band Roadmaster bandRoadmaster Although Chapman had initially chosen not to work with Exile again following the failure of Try It On his wife persuaded him to give the band a second chance as she liked their music and noted that unlike other bands he had worked with the members of Exile were polite to him Chapman invited the band to the Forum a recording studio in Covington Kentucky where he presented them with a song he had written called Kiss You All Over The band spent nearly an entire day in the studio recording it owing to Chapmans demanding production style Chapman found great difficulty with recording Stokleys voice due to his raspy delivery and poor sense of pitch and asked Pennington to sing the lines on which he could not get a satisfactory vocal from Stokley

Through a connection with music journalist Nola Leone Chapman was able to contact Curb Records owner Mike Curb who signed the band as he thought Kiss You All Over had potential to become a hit The bands contract consisted of four albums with Curb handling promotion and Warner Bros Records handling distributionref nameallmusic Exile began recording more songs written by Chapman and English songwriter Nicky Chinn along with six by Pennington These became the bands first Warner and Curb album Mixed Emotions Exile albumMixed Emotions 1978 During these recording sessions Williams became frustrated with the amount of control Chapman was exercising over the rest of the band as a result Williams was fired and replaced by Sonny LeMaire who knew Hargis through a number of cover bands the two had worked with in the early 1970s LeMaire played and sang backing vocals on two tracks on Mixed Emotions Never Gonna Stop and Stay with Me Exile songStay with Me Released in mid1978 Mixed Emotions featured elements of disco funk and pop rock

Curb released Kiss You All Over as the albums first single While the band noted that it was initially unpopular at live shows it began climbing the Billboard charts due to radio airplay Westbrook attributes the songs success to its sexually suggestive lyrics an observation also made by Tom Breihan of Stereogum in 2020ref namestereogum Kiss You All Over reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in September 1978 and held the position for four weeksref nameallmusicref namestereogumref The song was also an international success reaching number one on the Kent Music Report charts in Australiaref nameausref and number six on the UK Singles Chartref nameUKref Its success led to Exile appearing on variety shows such as The Midnight Special TV seriesThe Midnight Special Rogers also made arrangements to sign Exile with William Morris Agency a talent agency that assisted in booking the band as an opening act for Aerosmith and Heart bandHeart Warner issued two more singles from Mixed Emotions Never Gonna Stop did not chartref namemyriadref while You Thrill Me reached number 40 on the Hot 100ref namewhitburn2010ref Never Gonna Stop was later recorded by Linda Clifford whose version was sampling musicsampled on Tupac Shakurs All Eyez on Me Tupac Shakur songAll Eyez on Me Stay with Me was later covered by Dave  Sugar in 1985

19781981 All There Is Dont Leave Me This Way and Heart  Soul
Exile began working on their second Warner album All There Is in late 1978 before releasing it in 1979 During the sessions Chapman faced increasing difficulty recording Stokleys voice as the singer had developed nodule medicinenodules on his vocal cords and was weakened by hepatitis As a result Chapman asked Pennington and LeMaire to sing lead vocals on some tracks instead with both band members later noting that Chapman would often make them record as many as fifty takes until the vocal track was to his satisfaction In addition Chapman wanted the band to record disco as that genre was popular at the time and he thought doing so would help the band become popular again following the failure of You Thrill Me The recording sessions featured a large number of synthesizers and drum machines The opening and closing tracks How Could This Go Wrong and Too Proud to Cry were both over eight minutes long featuring a number of discoinfluenced instrument solos Too Proud to Cry was also Hargiss only writing credit Lets Do It Again served as the lead single reaching 88 on the Billboard Hot 100ref namewhitburn2010 Neither The Part of Me That Needs You Most nor Too Proud to Cry charted in the United States although the former was a minor chart hit in Australiaref nameaus Jay Black covered The Part of Me That Needs You Most in 1980 as did BJ Thomas in 1985refref

Due to the difficulties experienced during the All There Is recording sessions Stokley was fired at Chapmans insistence shortly after the albums release He was briefly replaced by vocalist and guitarist Randy Rickman who only lasted in the group for a couple of months due to his style not working with the rest of the band After this the band found vocalists Mark Gray singerMark Gray and Les Taylor singerLes Taylor who also contributed on keyboards and guitar respectively Chapman had recommended Gray after discovering him in Los Angeles Grays joining briefly led to the unusual scenario of Exile having three keyboardists him Cornelison and Hargis Pennington had chosen Taylor due to his involvement in a number of local bands that had played at Martin Youth Center and Specks Both Gray and Taylor began auditioning with Exile in August 1979 They made their debut on Exiles third Warner album Dont Leave Me This Way 1980 which featured them and Pennington alternating on lead vocals LeMaire thought Chapman had become increasingly focused on more successful bands with whom he collaborated such as Blondie bandBlondie and the Knack and had therefore lost interest in promoting and writing songs for Exile In addition due to his involvement with these bands his sound engineer Peter Coleman took over as producer The band members found that unlike Chapman Coleman was willing to accept their suggestions on how each song should sound Because of this LeMaire later remarked that he considered Dont Leave Me This Way the best of the bands Warner albums The albums two singles Youre Good for Me and Take Me Down both made the Bubbling Under Hot 100 singles chart in 1980ref namewhitburn2010 Both the latter and the album track The Closer You Get songThe Closer You Get were later recorded by Alabama bandAlabama whose versions topped the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts in the early 1980s In 1981 Cornelison left the band as he became more and more estranged from the soft rock and country pop influences of the album He reenrolled at Eastern Kentucky University where he acquired a masters degree in English in addition to working in local theater productions and running a craft shop with his family



Exile finished their contract with Warner and Curb in 1981 with Heart  Soul The band reinstated Chapman as producer as they thought working with him would help them become successful again and that Coleman was not strong at selecting songs with potential as hits LeMaire and Pennington wrote several songs on the album including Take This Heart which was later recorded by Kenny Rogers Heart  Soul continued to feature elements of soft rock but Westbrook also noted influences of country music beginning to appear on tracks such as One More Night for Love The albums only charted single release was its title track Heart and Soul Exile songHeart and Soul written by Chapman and Chinn which entered the Bubbling Under Hot 100 singles chart upon releaseref namewhitburn2010 This song would later be covered by Huey Lewis and the News whose version was a topten pop hit in 1983 What Kind of Love Is This was also a single but it did not chartrefref

Country music career
Exile was dropped from Warner and Curb in 1981 when their fouralbum contract expired Westbrook noted that the band did not have a positive critical reception at the time due to their soft rock sound As a result of this their manager Jim Morey suggested between late 1982 and early 1983 that the band begin recording country music due to that genres increasing popularity as well as the success of Take Me Down and The Closer You Get through their covers by Alabama While Pennington was interested in the band pursuing this genre Hargis and Goetzman were initially outspoken against such a change Despite the latter twos reservations the band began rehearsing covers of artists such as Merle Haggard and George Jones This led to them playing a country set at the Rebel Room a club inside a bowling alley in Lexington Kentucky before moving to another club called Breedings The band also played a number of shows in South Africa where Kiss You All Over had become popular in the interim

Gray left the band at this point as he wanted to become a solo artist As a result Pennington and Taylor became the bands two lead vocalists After writing a number of songs for Janie Fricke Gray was signed to Columbia Records in 1983 as a solo artistrefref He charted five topten singles on the Billboard country charts between 1984 and 1986 two of which Left Side of the Bed and Diamond in the Dust were cowritten by LeMaire Gray died of undisclosed causes at the age of 64 in 2016refref

19841985 Switch to country with Exile and Kentucky Hearts

Through Morey the band arranged a meeting with Nashvillebased producer and publisher Buddy Killen who invited them to play a number of shows at a Nashvillebased club called the Stockyard These shows were intended to aid in the bands transition to country and were attended by representatives of major Nashville record labels One such label Epic Records Nashville signed the band in 1983 By this point the band consisted of Pennington LeMaire Taylor Hargis and Goetzman Their first Epic album Exile 1983 Exile albumExile came out that same yearKillen produced the album and Hargis served as sound engineer Hargis noted that Killen was willing to let the band play all of their own instruments as opposed to most country bands at the time who relied on session musicians on their albums The album featured Taylor and Pennington alternating as lead vocalists and songwriters with Ricky Skaggs being the only outside musician on the entire project Although Gray had left by this point he was a cowriter on two tracks While their first country release High Cost of Leaving only reached number 27 on the Billboard country charts its followups Woke Up in Love Exile songWoke Up in Love and I Dont Want to Be a Memory both went to number one between late 1983 and early 1984 Exile also reached number ten on the Top Country Albums chart upon release The success of this album led to Pennington and LeMaire putting increased focus on their collaborative songwriting while also restarting the bands touring schedule Exile was nominated in 1983 for Top Vocal Group by the Academy of Country Music ACM a nomination they would receive again in 1984 1985 and 1987ref nameacmref They would also be nominated by the Country Music Association CMA for Vocal Group of the Year in every year from 1984 to 1987 as well as Instrumental Group of the Year in 1984 and 1985ref namecmaref

The bands second country album Kentucky Hearts was released in 1984 It was their only numberone album on the Billboard country albums charts As with the previous album Killen once again served as producer Pennington and LeMaire wrote the entire album by themselves except for the track Comin Apart at the Seams which Taylor wrote with his friend Jerry Marcum All three singles from Kentucky Hearts reached number one on the Billboard country charts These were Give Me One More Chance Crazy for Your Love and Shes a Miracle The band also produced a music video for Shes a Miracle which was one of the first to be aired on the television network CMT American TV channelCMT Tom Carter of the Lexington Kentucky HeraldLeader wrote that the band was more mellow and confident than on previous albums while also praising the harmony and instrumentationref nameheraldref During this timespan Killen had the band play instruments and perform backing vocals on Ronnie McDowells mid1985 hit Love Talks due to him also being a producer on that song In addition the Forester Sisters covered Just in Case Exile songJust in Case a track from Kentucky Hearts and took their rendition to number one on the country charts in 1985

19851986 Death of Stokley and Hang On to Your Heart
After the release of Kentucky Hearts the band members were informed of former lead singer Jimmy Stokleys continued decline in health In response they held a charity concert in Richmond to raise 18000 toward Stokleys medical bills which they succeeded in doing Other former members such as Davenport Cornelison Luxon and Howard were in attendance as well The members had intended for Stokley to join them onstage but he was too ill to do so Stokley died of hepatitis at the age of 41 in August 1985ref namestokleyref

This was followed in 1986 by the release of Exiles third Epic album Hang On to Your Heart albumHang On to Your Heart Pennington and LeMaire wrote the entirety of the album and it accounted for five singles These were Hang On to Your Heart I Could Get Used to You Super Love Exile songSuper Love Itll Be Me Exile songItll Be Me and Shes Too Good to Be True Exile songShes Too Good to Be True Of these all except Super Love went to number one on the Billboard country charts Although Taylor had sung lead on a number of album tracks prior to this point Itll Be Me and Shes Too Good to Be True were the first singles to feature him on lead vocals instead of Pennington LeMaire said that Itll Be Me was specifically written with the intent of having Taylor sing it due to him having a higher vocal range than Pennington In addition the track Music features Pennington rapping Due to the success of I Could Get Used to You and the Forester Sisters rendition of Just in Case which peaked at number one only six weeks apart Pennington and LeMaire were both awarded as top country songwriters of the year by Broadcast Music Inc BMI Walter Tunis of the Lexington HeraldLeader wrote that the playing is efficient and economical highlighting the number of uptempo tracks and the albums relatively short lengthref nametunisref

Midlate 1980s Shelter from the Night and departing members
Following Hang On to Your Heart Hargis noted that there was too much partying among the other band members and that the label wanted to have industry professionals take his place as the bands sound engineer In response he quit in early 1987 and stayed in Nashville to own a music store Lee Carroll took his place on keyboardsref nameallmusic Carroll had been serving as a backing musician for the Judds and had met the members of Exile a number of times in this capacity before Pennington invited him to join Executive Roy Wunsch had taken over as the head of Epic Records around this point and told the band members that he thought their sound had sameness Similarly Goetzman noted that radio disc jockeys had similarly thought that too many of Exiles songs sounded similar to each other and that perception in the country music scene had become increasingly negative toward Killens production style As a result Wunsch and other Epic executives ordered the band to fire Killen as their producer and begin seeking songs by other writers than Taylor and Pennington



The band chose Elliot Scheiner a pop producer who had worked with Bruce Hornsby and Steely Dan among others to produce their final Epic album Shelter from the Night 1987 Pennington thought that employing a pop producer would help the band change their sound as he had noted the crossover success Restless Heart had with Ill Still Be Loving You on pop formats Scheiner selected three songs by outside writers the title track Fly on the Wall written by Hornsby and Bernie Taupin and John Farrars Shes Already Gone all of which were sung by Taylor The album was recorded in June 1987 at Scheiners studio in Stamford Connecticut Westbrook describes the album as uneven due to Scheiners involvement and Carrolls use of synthesizers While the lead single I Cant Get Close Enough accounted for the bands tenth numberone single on Billboard the later releases were unsuccessful Feel Like Foolin Around only reached number 60 while Just One Kiss Exile songJust One Kiss and Its You Again Exile songIts You Again were minor chart entries as well Carroll attributed the singles failures to the success of the Judds and Randy Travis both of whom were having success with neotraditional country at the time Norman Rowe of the Richmond TimesDispatch thought the album contained influences of Southern rock and rhythm and bluesrefref while Ken Tucker of The Philadelphia Inquirer thought that it contained empty clicheridden countrypop music from a group whose members apparently think that turning up the volume on their guitars qualifies as a bold new directionref namePIref

Taylor quit the band in August 1987 as he was frustrated with the label almost exclusively choosing songs sung by Pennington as singles instead of ones sung by him In response he chose to begin a solo career He was replaced by multiinstrumentalist Paul Martin whose family owned a studio in Kentucky where Pennington had recorded on a number of occasions Shortly after Martins joining Pennington quit as well citing exhaustion the departure of Taylor and personality conflicts among him Martin and Carroll In particular Carroll thought Pennington was too controlling of the bands sound and would not let him write songs Penningtons last show with Exile would be on New Years Eve in 1988 and Martin was promoted to lead singer at the beginning of 1989 

Epic Records dropped the band in 1989 due to the failure of Shelter from the Night along with the departures of Taylor and Pennington After Martin was in place as lead singer the band members then began seeking a replacement for Taylor as well They found guitarist and vocalist Mark Jones who joined in early 1989 Jones had previously been aware of the band when he tried to hire them for his senior prom in 1978 but they were unable to attend due to scheduling conflicts Roger BonDurant briefly joined their touring band in late 1989 as a backing vocalist and rhythm guitarist but was not considered an official memberrefref LeMaire told Jack Hurst of the Chicago Tribune that the addition of Martin to the lineup opened up what we are capable of doing onstage due to his ability to play other instruments such as mandolin and Dobroref namehurstref In the same article Hurst thought that Martins singing voice was very similar to Penningtonsref namehurst

After Jones joined and Martin was promoted to lead singer the band began seeking a new recording contract Radio host Lon Helton heard them perform at a show in Hot Springs Arkansas and recommended the band to Tim DuBois a record executive who had just started the Arista Nashville label and was seeking new artists for it LeMaire was apprehensive at first as he thought the new lineup should not retain the name Exile due to Penningtons absence but DuBois thought the name recognition would help the new label and signed the band by the end of 1989 Exile released their first Arista Nashville album Still Standing Exile albumStill Standing in early 1990 DuBois coproduced it with Randy Sharp a songwriter who had success with Restless Heart and also wrote several songs on the album Still Standing was led off by the single Keep It in the Middle of the Road cowritten by Pennington and LeMaire and featuring Martin on lead vocals The song was a top20 country hit in early 1990 An uncredited review of the single in Billboard stated of the song Hot guitar and piano licks strike like lightning throughout this lively tightly performed numberrefref After it were Nobodys Talking and Yet songYet the bands final topten country hits Both were cowritten and sung by LeMaire accounting for his first contributions as lead vocalist since All There Is Keep It in the Middle of the Road and Nobodys Talking were promoted through music videos as well Despite the success of Nobodys Talking and Yet the fourth single There You Go underperformed on the charts

Their second and final album for Arista Nashville was 1991s Justice Exile albumJustice which also featured DuBois and Sharp as producers While the lead single Even Now Exile songEven Now composed by Sharp and Marc Beeson was a top20 country hit the other two singles Nothing at All and Somebodys Telling Her Lies failed to chart at all Westbrook noted that the former song was quickly withdrawn from release due to concerns that it was too similar to Reba McEntires For My Broken Heart songFor My Broken Heart DuBois had suggested Somebodys Telling Her Lies as a replacement but Westbrook thought that the song failed due to it lacking a hook musichook

Earlymid 1990s Solo careers 30year anniversary and hiatus
Both Taylor and Pennington began their solo careers during Exiles tenure on Arista Nashville Taylor released two albums for Epic as a solo artist That Old Desire in 1990 and Blue Kentucky Wind a year laterrefref These albums charted a combined three singles and the latter included a song written with early Exile member Bernie Faulkner titled The Porchlight Penningtons only solo album Whatever It Takes was also released in 1991 on MCA Nashville Produced by Barry Beckett the album included two singles in its title track and You Gotta Get Serious Pennington performed two shows in Lexington Kentucky to promote the album both of which included BonDurant as guitaristrefref Meanwhile LeMaire and Beeson wrote Restless Hearts 1992 hit When She Cries

Taylor thought that the band members solo albums were unsuccessful due to radio backlash against Exile in the intervening years Relatedly the members of Exile attributed the failure of their Arista albums to the lack of Pennington and Taylor as well as a perception that Arista had begun to focus more heavily on Diamond Rio after that band reached number one in 1991 with their debut single Meet in the Middle Exile ended their contract with Arista and focused on touring while in search of another recording contract They played an average of 150 shows a year between 1991 and 1993 They held a 30year anniversary concert in 1993 which also included Cornelison Pennington Luxon and Davenport Despite this the bands tour bus was robbed after a concert in 1993 which they took as a sign to retire from touring Jones Martin and LeMaire did one show in 1994 at Dollywood while they Carroll and Goetzman recorded Latest and Greatest for Intersound Records that same year The album included a mix of original content and rerecordings of previous hit singles One such rerecording was of Super Love which included several keyboard and synthesizer parts played by Martin He also received his only writing credit for the band on the new song LOVE Spells Trouble

After this album Exile officially disbanded in 1995 Both Jones and Goetzman became artist managers the former working with Pat Green and the latter with Steve Wariner In 1997 LeMaire and Beeson joined former Southern Pacific bandSouthern Pacific member Kurt Howell in the group Burnin Daylight which released one album on Curb Records Martin chose to pursue a solo career but after proving unsuccessful in this regard he found work as a backing musician for Kathy Mattea Later on he became bassist in Marty Stuarts touring band the Fabulous Superlatives before touring with his wife and four children as the Martin Family Circus Carroll joined his brother in franchising a number of Papa Johns pizza restaurants in Pennsylvania

Late 1990spresent Reunion
Following the failures of their solo careers Pennington and Taylor sought to reform Exile They played a few local shows with various musicians on keyboards drums and bass before establishing a lineup with Steve Richmond on drums Ray Salyer on bass and Jason Witt on keyboards This lineup played a concert at Billy Bobs Texas in Fort Worth Texas in 2005 and that concert was issued as an album titled Live at Billy Bobs Texas Meanwhile LeMaire had further success as a songwriter in the first decade of the 21st century including Diamond Rios Beautiful Mess Diamond Rio songBeautiful Mess Andy Griggss She Thinks She Needs Me and Clay Walkers Fall Clay Walker songFall also covered by Kimberley Locke He collaborated with Shane Minor and Clay Mills on all three

Musical styles
Exile is noted for their successful transition from pop and rock music to country musicref namevirgin Writing for AllMusic Steve Huey stated that Among rock listeners Exile is remembered as the onehit wonder responsible for 1978s number one smash Kiss You All Over However in the early 80s the Kentuckybred band reinvented itself as a country outfitand a hugely successful one at thatref nameallmusic Author Randy Westbrook in 50 Years of Exile The Story of a Band in Transition found hard rock influences in the bands Warner albums particularly in the gruffness of original lead singer Jimmy Stokleys voice as well as the guitars drums and synthesizers present on tracks from All There Is Huey stated that Taylor spearheaded the bands transition to country musicref nameallmusic while Westbrook noted that the success of The Closer You Get and Take Me Down in their subsequent covers by Alabama was also integral to the shift of Exiles sound Westbrook also thought that Taylor and Pennington both had Southern accents conducive to singing country Hargis told Cashbox magazineCashbox in 1984 It originally started as a rhythm and blues group When I joined it had developed into a rock n roll band I suppose because it was the thing to do at the time even though we all grew up with country music it wasnt the thing to do to be in a country bandref namecashboxref

Most of the bands sound is defined by the songwriting composition and singing of Pennington and LeMaire Westbrook noted Penningtons sense of melody such as the use of Lydian mode on the title track of All There Is as well as the Southern gospel chord progressions of Woke Up in Love and the Hang On to Your Heart album track Promises Promises Additionally Westbrook found influences of Western swing and boogiewoogie on tracks such as Ive Never Seen Anything Proud to Be Her Man and Keep It in the Middle of the Road Also present on the albums with Epic were threepart vocal harmonies among Pennington Taylor and LeMaireref nametunis Pennington usually handled lead vocal duties on the Epic albums including almost all the singles although Taylor sang Itll Be Me and Shes Too Good to Be True Of these songs Westbrook wrote that their success started a new streak and proved that Les voice could prove as popular on country radio as JPs Most of the early Epic albums were dominated by collaborative songwriting between Pennington and LeMaire Of their songwriting relationship they both said they usually wrote together at the piano and would start coming up with lyrics after one of them provided a title Tom Carter of the Lexington HeraldLeader thought that the bands vocal harmonies and often contrasting rhythms playing against the tone of the song were notable elements of the bands overall soundref nameherald Hargis noted that Exile was one of the first country bands to play all the instruments on their own albums instead of using session musiciansref namewatts an observation also made by Pennington Similarly Walter Tunis thought in a review of Hang On to Your Heart that the albums lack of studio musicians such as a string section as well as Pennington and LeMaires dominance as songwriters on the album would help the band stand out among their contemporariesref nametunis Ellen Creager of the Detroit Free Press wrote in a review of Kentucky Hearts that both Pennington and Taylor have husky voices any girl could fall in love with She also noted that the album unlike most other country albums at the time largely consisted of uptempo materialrefref

Music career
19831988 Early career
Black was initially drawn to a variety of musical genres  According to his father he chose to focus on country music in the early 1980s after singers George Strait and Reba McEntire moved the genre back toward the more traditional in the style kept alive by George Jones and Merle Haggardref namemitchell1989  For six years Black supported himself as a construction worker bait cutter and fishing guideref namelongref while singing at various lounges as a solo singer and guitaristref namemitchell1989  In 1987 at one of the gigs he met another guitarist Hayden Nicholas  The two men connected musically and began a song writing partnership that would last decadesref namemitchell1989  In the late 1980s Black delivered a demo of their collaboration Nobodys Home to record promoter Sammy Alfano  Within two days of that delivery Black was invited to a meeting with Bill Ham who managed ZZ Topref namemitchell1989 

19891991 Breakthrough
Black soon signed with RCA in October of 1987 and at the time RCA was considered one of the most aggressive labels in country musicref nameracineref His first album Killin Time Clint Black albumKillin Time was released in 1989  Each song on the album was penned at least in part by Black four of them were attributed solely to him while the rest were collaborations with Nicholas  In a departure from most other country albums Black used his road band instead of session musicians to record Killin Timeref namemitchell1989  The album was a critical and commercial successref namegraff  reaching List of numberone country albums of 1990 USnumber one on the Billboard Country AlbumsBillboard Country Albums chart and certified platinum in 1990ref namemitchell1991ref He made his debut in 1989 with the single A Better Man Clint Black songA Better Man which reached number one on the Hot Country SongsBillboard Hot Country Songs in early June This marked the first time in 14 years that a debut single by a male artist had peaked at the top of the chartref namemitchell1989  In total five singles off of his debut album reached number one the first time any country artist had accomplished this featref namehodges2000  Black won the Country Music Associations Horizon Award for best newcomer in 1989ref namelong refref At the end of the year his singles A Better Man and Killin Time Clint Black songKillin Time place number one and number two on the yearend country singles charts  It had been 36 years since another artist had claimed both top spots in a single yearref namelong  Looking back at the early stages of his career Black recalled At one point I knew I crossed this line out of obscurity and I felt like no matter what happened from that point on I would always be remembered for Killin Time There was this kind of mixed feeling of remorse and excitementref namemitchell1992ref

In late 1990 the Los Angeles Times surveyed country music industry insiders to determine which acts could be expected to sell the most records over the next seven yearsref groupNoteSeven years was the typical length of a recording contractref Black placed second in the poll two votes behind Garth Brooks  The survey results were surprising in that 10 of the top 20 artists named were relative newcomers to the industry in the past country music had been dominated by artists with several decades experienceref namehilburnref The plethora of new acts confused some reviewers however  Many reviewers lumped many of the new acts together as Newsweeks David Gates wrote Good song good voice hot band who cares which one it is this timeref namegates   Black soon became known as one of Nashvilles hat acts like other country artists such as Tracy Lawrence Alan Jackson and John Michael Montgomery Black was a relative newcomer who wore a hat and had clean neotraditional sound with pop appealref namegates 

Killin Time was certified platinum in 1990  Blacks second album Put Yourself in My Shoes was released in November 1990  It reached number two on the country chart and was in the top 20 on the pop album chartsref namemitchell1991  This success on the pop charts resulted from a change in the way Billboard calculated album sales a new reliance on Nielsen SoundScan instead of information from selected record stores showed that sales of country albums had previously been under countedref namegatesref The album did not meet with as much critical acclaim as his debut but nonetheless still included several hit singles He began touring with Alabama American bandAlabama

Black has been a member of the Grand Ole Opry since 1991refrefrefref

1992 Lawsuits and The Hard Way
In March 1992 Black sued his manager Bill Ham for breach of contract Black sought 2nbspmillion in damages and requested that Ham return 4nbspmillion in royalties  Under the terms of their initial contract Ham controlled all publishing royalties for any song that Black wrote or cowrote for his first eight albums  Because Black wrote all of his own music this amounted to a fee of 20 to 30 cents per album sold  Industry standards generally counseled songwriters to form their own publication companies so they would be able to retain more of the royaltiesref namemitchell1992 

Ham promptly countersued blaming the initial lawsuit on poor advice Black received from his new personal assistant his motherinlaw Jonni Hartman  His lawyer told the press that Mr Ham invested 1 million of his own money in Clint Blacks career at a time when nobody else would do so For that commitment Mr Black should show a little gratitude and honor his contractsref namemitchell1992 

By mid1992 Blacks first two albums had sold a combined 5nbspmillion copiesref namemitchell1992  The difficulties with Ham caused a delay in the release of Blacks third albumref namemitchelloctober1992ref The Hard Way Clint Black albumThe Hard Way which was released on July 14ref namemitchell1992  The album had been expected the year previously and during the delay the country music scene changed  Both Alan Jackson and Travis Tritt achieved greater success and Billy Ray Cyrus became a teen idol  The competition that Black faced was now much stiffer than with his earlier albumsref namemitchelloctober1992 

According to Black he and producer James Stroud spent more time putting this album together than either of those preceding and were a lot more aggressive in the way we cut and mixed the albumref namemitchell1992  Black was also more satisfied with the vocals on this albumref namemitchell1992  Several of the songs on The Hard Way including Burn One Down were initially reported to be Blacks responses to his situation with Ham  Co writer Nicholas refuted the rumors maintaining that most of those songs were written in the late 1980sref namemitchell1993 

To promote the album Black launched The Hard Way Tour on June 26 1992  The tour ran for 11 months  Reviewers noticed that with this album Black presented a new sexier image wearing tighter clothing and in many cases leaving behind his trademark hat  Black commented simply that he was bored wearing the hat all the timeref namemitchell1992 

19931999 Continued success

Blacks fourth album No Time to Kill was released almost a year after The Hard Way  The album received mixed reviews  The Houston Chronicle noted that Blacks duet with Wynonna Judd A Bad Goodbye was precisely the kind of radioready bigproduction ballad that record companies tend to force on their artists when they sense that their careers are in troubleIt sticks out like a sore thumb in his body of workref namemitchellNoTime  On the other hand a review in Time magazine thought the duet helped Black show his emotions more intenselyref namefarleyref Some reviewers also noted that in some of the more serious songs on the album Blacks voice sounded strainedref namemitchellNoTime  On January 30 1994 Black performed as part of the Rockin Country Sunday halftime show at Super Bowl XXVII along with Judd Tanya Tucker Travis Tritt and Naomi Judd

One Emotion followed in late 1994 Also a platinum certified album in the US this album accounted for five straight top five hits First was the number four Untanglin My Mind a Merle Haggard cowrite After it came the number three Wherever You Go threeweek number one Summers Comin the number two title track and finally the number four Life Gets Away The latter two were also number one country hits in Canada

Whitley and Skaggs both sixteen years old were discovered in Ft Gay West Virginia by Ralph Stanley who was 45 minutes late for a gig due to a flat tire Stanley opened the door of the club and heard what he thought was the Stanley Brothers playing on a jukebox However it was Whitley and Skaggs who sounded just like me and Carter in the early days The two soon joined Stanleys band Whitley became lead singer for Stanley in 1974  Whitley also played with JD Crowe  the New South in the mid1970sref nameAP During this period he established himself as one of the most versatile and talented lead singers in bluegrass His singing was heavily influenced by Carter Stanley and Lefty Frizzell He moved to Nashville in 1983 to pursue a country music career and soon signed a record deal with RCA Recordsref nameAP

Whitleys first solo album A Hard Act to Follow was released in 1984 and featured a more mainstream country style While Whitley was working hard to achieve his own style the songs he produced were inconsistent Critics regarded the album as too erratic Whitley honed his sound within the next few years for his next album LA to Miami

LA to Miami released in 1985 would give him his first Top 20 country hit single Miami My Amy The song was followed by three more hit songs Ten Feet Away Homecoming 63 and Hard Livin The album also included On the Other Hand and Nobody in His Right Mind Wouldve Left Her On the Other Hand was pitched to Whitley before Randy Travis released the song as a single and when Whitleys version wasnt released as a single Travis released his in 1986 as did George Strait with Nobody in His Right Mind Wouldve Left Her

During his tour to promote LA to Miami he met and began a romantic relationship with country singer Lorrie Morgan They were married in November 1986 and  had their only child a son Jesse Keith Whitley in June 1987 Whitley also adopted Lorries daughter Morgan from her first marriage

During the new recording sessions in 1987 Whitley began feeling that the songs he was  were not up to his standards so he approached RCA and asked if the project of 15 songs could be shelved He also asked if he could take a major role in creating the songs and in production The new album titled Dont Close Your Eyes albumDont Close Your Eyes was released in 1988 and the album sold extremely well The album contained one of the many songs that Whitley had a hand in writing in his years at Tree Publishing Its All Coming Back to Me Now On the album was a remake of Lefty Frizzells classic standard I Never Go Around Mirrors and the song became a huge hit at Whitleys concerts The first three singles from the albumWhen You Say Nothing at All Im No Stranger to the Rain and the title cutall reached No 1 on Billboard magazineBillboards country charts during the autumn of 1988 and the winter of 1989 with the title track Dont Close Your Eyes being ranked as Billboards No 1 Country song of 1988 Shortly thereafter Im No Stranger to the Rain also earned Whitley his first and only Country Music Association award as a solo artist and a Grammy nomination for Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal PerformanceBest Country Vocal Performance Male

In early 1989 Whitley approached RCA chairman Joe Galante with the intention of releasing I Never Go Around Mirrors as a single Galante approved of the musical flexibility that Whitley achieved with the song however he suggested that Whitley record something new and more upbeat The result was a song Whitley had optioned for his previous album called I Wonder Do You Think of Me and was to result in his next album release

Whitley was scheduled to be invited to join the Grand Ole Opry in late May 1989 He was posthumously inducted as a former member on October 14 2023 in a tribute concert held during that nights Opry broadcastrefref

Legacy
Several film projects depicting Whitleys life were slated but none have come to fruition One idea was a film version of the George VesceyLorrie Morganpenned Forever Yours Faithfully While Morgans book was a benchmark in piecing together Whitleys final moments perhaps the most research went into a project titled Kentucky Bluebird which was to star writeractordirector David L KeithDavid Keith This project was in development hell for several years and was halted in late 2006 after difficulties with casting and funding Another film project started in 2004 by songwriter Jeff Swope was a biopic chronicling Whitleys life and passing The last information about the project came in 2010 when he announced that preproduction was set to begin pending investorsrefMirrors The Keith Whitley Story  WordPress April 13 2010ref

Biography

Randy dropped out of school in the ninth grade As a teenager he committed a number of criminal offenses These included reckless driving after he crashed Rickys car in a cornfield breaking into a church to hold a party driving under the influence resisting arrest and stealing knives and watches from a local store On his seventeenth birthday Randy was arrested for public intoxication and faced imprisonment Despite his charges Don Cusic noted in the 1990 book Randy Travis The King of the New Country Traditionalists that his parents still supported him as they would pay his bail and support him in court whenever he was arrested

In 1977 the Traywicks entered a talent competition held in Charlotte North Carolina after hearing an advertisement for it on the radio The grand prize for the contest was 100 cash and a recording session The contest consisted of eight semifinal audition rounds held every Tuesday at Country City USA a nightclub coowned by Randys thenfuture wife Mary Elizabeth Lib Hatcherref namevirgin At the performance Randy played rhythm guitar and sang while Ricky played lead guitar However Ricky had to drop out of the competition partway through because he had to serve time at a youth detention center leaving Randy to continue as a solo act Randy ended up winning the competition After doing so he began to hold a conversation with Hatcher about his thenimpending arrest charges for hotwiring a neighbors truck Hatcher and disc jockey John Harper who also worked at the club chose to represent Randy in court which led to him serving probation and coming under the custody of the Hatchers in lieu of a jail sentenceref nameallmusic Additionally Hatcher employed Randy as a singer at Country City USA During this time Hatcher advised him on his singing and performance Harold would attend Randys performances in this timespan but was later banned from the club after altercations with patrons

Legacy

Impact
Alabama has been credited with substantially broadening countrys audience while becoming one of the most popular acts in American musical history by Michael McCall of The Encyclopedia of Country Music The band was notable for its threeperson lead as most other country acts focused on a soloist accompanied by an anonymous band their collective hair length and facial hair which would have been deemed unacceptable just a decade earlier and their prominent electric bass and drumsref nameBiographicalDictionary They had a slightly edgier sound than other groups and both played their own instruments and wrote their own songsref nametenn Alabama mostly appealed to a younger audience although their cleancut image appealed to the more Conservatism in the United Statesconservative older country audience as wellref nameBiographicalDictionary Kurt Wolff described the bands appeal Theyre just rebel enough for the young folks but their parents also dig the boys pretty harmonies sentimental soft spots and oldfashioned family valuesref namewolffWolff Kurt 2000 Country Music The Rough Guide Rough Guides 608 pp First edition 2000ref Alabama gave prominence to their hometown of Fort Payne and also raised awareness for environmental issues

The bands incorporation of rock and roll into their sound was an inspiration for groups such as Restless Heart Shenandoah bandShenandoah Exile American bandExile Diamond Rio Lonestar Ricochet bandRicochet and the Mavericksref namebillboard1 According to Irwin Stambler and Grelun Landon authors of Country Music The Encyclopedia the groups diminishing sales in the late 1980s reflected competition from country bands that would not have received recognition had it not been for Alabama paving the way For their part these groups credited Alabama with providing a massive influence on their careers Prior to Alabamas unprecedented chart success most country hit singles belonged to solo artists or duets Many Alabama singles and albums represented crossover appeal on the pop charts

Despite their successes Alabamas career was loathed by music critics of the day citing the vacuous songs and watereddown middleoftheroad arrangements that blurred lines between country and pop The Baltimore Sun once argued the band renders country music all but indistinguishable from pop and thus trivializes some of countrys most hallowed traditions Indeed reviewers such as Wolff consider the bands overriding problem their calculated sound which leads many contemporary music critics to label the band mediocreref namewolff

Philanthropy
Beginning in 1982 and continuing until 1997 Alabama sponsored the June Jam a music festival in Fort Payne which at its peak drew 60000 fans and raised millions for local charities The group also held Fan Appreciation Days weekend events that included a golf tournament and a songwriters concert that raised money for charities in Fort Payneref namebillboard1 Owen spearheaded Country Cares for Kids an annual country Telethonradiothon that raised over 70nbspmillion for St Jude Childrens Research Hospital in Memphis Tennesseeref namebillboard1

David Ball was born into a large musical family headed by his father William Billy Ball a Baptist minister and his mother Bessie Ball a pianist Later he moved with his family to Spartanburg South Carolina where his father was pastor of Fernwood Baptist church He eventually learned to play guitar after persuading his parents to buy him one Having written his first song in seventh grade he played it in a school talent show with a band he had formed the Strangers Afterwards he played upright bass in various local youth groups and also the school orchestra Together with friends he took part in various Bluegrass musicbluegrass and country musiccountry festivals in the Carolinas

By the time Ball had left high school he had a gig playing bass in Uncle Walts Band a trio headed by Walter Hyatt who relocated to Austin Texas in the mid1970s in an attempt to make a mainstream breakthrough

Ball subsequently focused on a solo career moving to Nashville Tennessee where he was signed to a publishing contract Three singles for RCA Records NashvilleRCA Nashville in the late 1980s failed to provide a solo breakthrough however and a projected album was shelved and was not released until 1994 The experience did at least serve to introduce him to producer Blake Chancey son of country producer Ron Chancey In the spring of 1993 Chancey called Warner Bros Records director Doug Grau on Balls behalf

A new recording contract followed Thinkin Problem his debut album was released on Warner Bros Its title track served as the leadoff single reaching Nonbsp2 on the Billboard magazineBillboard country music charts and Nonbsp40 on the Billboard Hot 100Billboard Hot 100 The album which received a platinum certification in the US also produced the singles When the Thought of You Catches Up with Me Look What Followed Me Home What Do You Want with His Love and Honky Tonk Healin although the latter two singles failed to make Top 40 on the country charts

Ball recorded two more albums for the label  Starlite Lounge and Play  without much chart success However Riding with Private Malone from the 2001 album Amigo on the Dualtone label reached a peak of Nonbsp2 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles  Tracks charts now Hot Country Songs chart and Nonbsp36 on the Billboard Hot 100 This album failed to produce any other hits however and Ball exited Dualtone in 2002 Freewheeler followed in 2004 Heartaches by the Number in 2007 and Sparkle City in 2010

In the 1995 album Come Together America Salutes The Beatles David Balls version of Ill Follow The Sun starts off the collection of Beatles songs by other artists

Balls Thinkin Problem was parodied by Cledus T Judd Ball then appears in Judds Shania Twain parody If Shania Was Mine standing behind the cameras and saying At least hes not picking on me this time

At the onset of her musical career she made the decision to perform under a stage name  She stated My real name is not a secret but I decided to take on another name mostly because I feel that my real name is not that memorableI started thinking about titles that would reflect my music and I was thinking about how I would describe it and it was all very rootsy and tenacious and organic and it all lent itself to this sort of tree flavour and I thought well maybe theres a tree name that would help us with titling this thing And honestly sycamore was one of the first that I looked at and thought it was coolrefref

Sykamore received first prize in the ATB Financial AllAlbertan Songwriting contest with her original song Heaven in the Pinesref name0ref Her song I Can Make You Happy was featured on Season 8 of the Canadian television series Heartland Canadian TV seriesHeartland In 2015 she was nominated for the Canadian Country Music Association Discovery Awardref nameReview  SYKAMORE

 History 
The Oak Ridge Quartet
The core group that would eventually lead to the Oak Ridge Boys was a country group called Wally Fowler and the Georgia Clodhoppers formed in 1943 in Knoxville Tennessee They were requested to perform for staff members and their families restricted during World War II at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in nearby Oak Ridge Tennessee They were asked to sing there so often that eventually they changed their name to the Oak Ridge Quartet and because their most popular songs were gospel Fowler decided to focus solely on Southern gospel music At the time the quartet was made up of Wally Fowler Lon Deacon Freeman Curly Kinsey and Johnny New This group began recording in 1947refref Wally Fowler and the Oak Ridge Quartet were members of the Grand Ole Opry in the 1940srefref  In 1949 the other three men split from Fowler to form a new group Curley Kinsey and the Tennessee Ridge Runners so Fowler hired an existing group the Calvary Quartet to reform the Oak Ridge Quartet Walt Cornell sang baritone for the Oak Ridge Quartet in the early 1950s In 1957 Fowler sold the rights to the Oak Ridge Quartet name to group member Smitty Gatlin in exchange for forgiveness of a debt As a result of more personnel changes the group lost its tenor so they lowered their arrangements and had Gatlin sing tenor while the pianist Tommy Fairchild sang lead They recorded an album for Cadence Records then in 1958 they hired Willie Wynn to sing the tenor part and Fairchild moved back exclusively to the piano At this point the group consisted of Fairchild at the piano Wynn Gatlin singing lead baritone Ron Page and bass Herman Harper They recorded an album on the Checker Records record labellabel one on Starday RecordsStarday and three on Skylite In 1961 Gatlin changed the groups name to the Oak Ridge Boys because their record producerproducer Bud Praeger thought Oak Ridge Quartet sounded too oldfashioned for their contemporary sound

19621973
In 1962 Ron Page left and the group hired Gary McSpadden who had filled in for Jake Hess in the Statesmen Quartet as baritone with the understanding from Jake Hess that when he was ready to start a group he would recruit McSpadden They recorded another album on Skylite and then two groundbreaking albums on Warner Bros Records When Hess followed through on that promise McSpadden quit to join a new group Hess was forming the Imperials Jim Hamillrefref who later became a mainstay in the Kingsmen Quartet was chosen to be his replacement They made one album for Festival Records one for Stateswood Skylites budget label and two more for Skylite Hamill did not get along with the rest of the group and William Lee Golden a newcomer to the music industry felt that Hamill was hurting the group and asked the group if he could be Hammils replacement After Hamills retirement from the group in 1964 Golden joined as baritone

The group recorded another album for Starday and another on Skylite in 1965 In 1966 Gatlin left the group to become a minister of music and on Goldens recommendation Duane Allen formerly of the Southernairs Quartet and more recently baritone of the Prophets Quartet was hired to replace him With Willie Wynn still singing tenor and Herman Harper as bass the group made another album for Skylite and one for United Artists RecordsUnited Artists and then began recording on the Heart Warming label Between 1966 and 1973 they made 12 albums with Heart Warming and the company also released several compilation albums on which they were included during those years The group also had an album on Vista Heart Warmings budget label that included unreleased songs from previous sessions Harper left the group in 1968 to join the Don Light Talent Agency before starting his own company the Harper Agency which remains one of the most reputable booking agencies in gospel music Noel Fox formerly of the Tennesseans and the Harvesters took over the bass part In 1970 the Oak Ridge Boys earned their first Grammy Award for Talk About the Good Times

In late October 1972 Richard Sterban the bass with J D Sumner and the Stamps Quartet left that group and joined the Oak Ridge Boys The quartet that appeared on Hee Haw in 1972 consisted of Willie Wynn Duane Allen William Lee Golden and Richard Sterban Joe Bonsall a Philadelphia native who was a member of the Keystone Quartet and recording on Duane Allens Superior label joined in April 1973 Sterban and Bonsall had both been in the Keystones during the late 1960s recording much of the ORBs material That same year the Oak Ridge Boys recorded a single with Johnny Cash and the Carter Family Praise the Lord and Pass the Soup that put them on the country charts for the first time The groups lineup remained consistent for the next 15 years

After opening a series of shows for Roy Clark the group moved in 1973 to the Columbia RecordsColumbia label for which they made three albums and several single musicsingles In early 1976 they toured Russia for three weeks with Roy Clark They went from being one of the top acts on Heart Warming to nearly the bottom on Columbia in terms of promoter entertainmentpromotion Columbia did not serve the gospel radio stations like Heart Warming did leaving the impression that the Oak Ridge Boys were leaving gospel music which hurt the groups popularity among its core fan demographic While promoting the single Heaven Bound the Oak Ridge Boys made appearances on The Mike Douglas Show and The Merv Griffin Show both nationally syndicated in the United States and Canada In 1976 despite having been picked by Paul Simon to sing backup on Slip Slidin Away the group asked to be released from its contract with Columbia after its single Family Reunion was only a lukewarm success Columbia complied with the request and the band immediately made a live album that was a mix of gospel and country on their own label

Career
Early career

Upon his release from San Quentin in 1960 Haggard started digging ditches for his brothers electrical contracting company Soon he was performing again and later began recording with Tally Records The Bakersfield sound was developing in the area as a reaction against the overproduced Nashville sound Haggards first record for Tally was Singing My Heart Out backed by Skid Row it was not a success and only 200 copies were pressed In 1962 Haggard wound up performing at a Wynn Stewart show in Las Vegas ValleyLas Vegas and heard Wynns Sing a Sad Song He asked for permission to record it and the resulting single was a national hit in 1964 The following year he had his first national top10 record with My Friends Are Gonna Be Strangers written by Liz Anderson mother of country singer Lynn Anderson and his career was off and running Haggard recalls having been talked into visiting Andersona woman he did not knowat her house to hear her sing some songs she had written If there was anything I didnt wanna do it was sit around some danged womans house and listen to her cute little songs But I went anyway She was a pleasant enough lady pretty with a nice smile but I was all set to be bored to death even more so when she got out a whole bunch of songs and went over to an old pump organ There they were My God one hit right after another There must have been four or five number one songs there

In 1967 Haggard recorded Im a Lonesome Fugitive with The Strangers American bandthe Strangers also written by Liz Anderson with her husband Casey Anderson which became his first numberone singleref nameRS15ref When the Andersons presented the song to Haggard they were unaware of his prison stretch Bonnie Owens Haggards backup singer and thenwife is quoted by music journalist Daniel Cooper in the liner notes to the 1994 retrospective Down Every Road I guess I didnt realize how much the experience at San Quentin did to him cause he never talked about it all that much  I could tell he was in a dark mood  and I said Is everything okay And he said Im really scared And I said Why And he said Cause Im afraid someday Im gonna be out there  and theres gonna be  some prisoner  in there the same time I was in stand upand theyre gonna be about the third row downand say What do you think youre doing 45200 Cooper notes that the news had little effect on Haggards career Its unclear when or where Merle first acknowledged to the public that his prison songs were rooted in personal history for to his credit he doesnt seem to have made some big splash announcement In a May 1967 profile in Music City News his prison record is never mentioned but in July 1968 in the very same publication its spoken of as if it were common knowledgeref nameautogenerated1962ref

The 1967 album Branded Man with The Strangers American bandthe Strangers kicked off an artistically and commercially successful run for Haggard In 2013 Haggard biographer David Cantwell stated The immediate successors to Im a Lonesome FugitiveBranded Man in 1967 and in 68 Sing Me Back Home and The Legend of Bonnie and Clydewere among the finest albums of their respective years Haggards new recordings showcased his band the Strangers specifically Roy Nicholss Telecaster Ralph Mooneys steel guitar and the harmony vocals provided by Bonnie Owens

At the time of Haggards first top10 hit My Friends Are Gonna Be Strangers in 1965 Owens who had been married to Buck Owens was known as a solo performer a fixture on the Bakersfield CaliforniaBakersfield club scene and someone who had appeared on television She won the new Academy of Country Musics first ever award for Female Vocalist after her 1965 debut album Dont Take Advantage of Me hit the top five on the country albums chart However Bonnie Owens had no further hit singles and although she recorded six solo albums on Capitol between 1965 and 1970 she became mainly known for her background harmonies on Haggard hits such as Sing Me Back Home songSing Me Back Home and Branded Manrefref

Producer Ken Nelson took a handsoff approach to produce Haggard In the episode of American Masters dedicated to him Haggard remembers The producer I had at that time Ken Nelson was an exception to the rule He called me Mr Haggard and I was a little twentyfour twentyfiveyearold punk from Oildale He gave me complete responsibility I think if hed jumped in and said Oh you cant do that it wouldve destroyed meref nameAmericanMastersref In the documentary series Lost Highway Nelson recalls When I first started recording Merle I became so enamored with his singing that I would forget what else was going on and I suddenly realized Wait a minute theres musicians here youve got to worry about But his songshe was a great writerrefref

Towards the end of the decade Haggard composed several numberone hits including Mama Tried songMama Tried The Legend of Bonnie and Clyde Hungry Eyes and Sing Me Back Home Daniel Cooper calls Sing Me Back Home a ballad that works on so many different levels of the soul it defies ones every attempt to analyze itref nameautogenerated1962  In a 1977 interview in Billboard magazineBillboard with Bob Eubanks Haggard reflected Even though the crime was brutal and the guy was an incorrigible criminal its a feeling you never forget when you see someone you know make that last walk They bring him through the yard and theres a guard in front and a guard behindthats how you know a death prisoner They brought Rabbit out  taking him to see the Father  prior to his execution That was a strong picture that was left in my mind  In 1969 Haggards first tribute LP Same Train A Different TimeSame Train Different Time A Tribute to Jimmie Rodgers was also released to acclaim

In the 1969 Rolling Stone review for Haggard and the Strangers 1968 album Mama Tried Andy Wickham wrote His songs romanticize the hardships and tragedies of Americas transient proletarian and his success is resultant of his inherent ability to relate to his audience a commonplace experience with precisely the right emotional pitch Merle Haggard looks the part and sounds the part because he is the part Hes greatrefref

Okie from Muskogee and The Fightin Side of Me
In 1969 Haggard and the Strangers released Okie from Muskogee songOkie From Muskogee with lyrics ostensibly reflecting the singers pride in being from Middle America United StatesMiddle America where people are conventionally patriotic dont smoke marijuana dont take LSD dont protest by Draftcard burningburning draft cards or otherwise Antiauthoritarianismchallenge authorityrefMalone Bill Country Music USA 2nd rev ed University of Texas Press Austin 2002 p 371ref American president Richard Nixon wrote an appreciative letter to Haggard upon his hearing of the song and would go on to invite Haggard to perform at the White House several timesrefrefrefref

In the ensuing years Haggard gave varying statements regarding whether he intended the song as a humorous satire or a serious political statement in support of conservative valuesrefref In a 2001 interview Haggard called the song a documentation of the uneducated that lived in America at the time However he made several other statements suggesting that he meant the song seriously On the Bob Edwards Show he said I wrote it when I recently got out of the joint I knew what it was like to lose my freedom and I was getting really mad at these protesters They didnt know anything more about the war in Vietnam than I did I thought how my dad who was from Oklahoma would have felt I felt I knew how those boys fighting in Vietnam feltref namekaufmanref In the country music documentary series Lost Highway he elaborated My dad passed away when I was nine and I dont know if youve ever thought about somebody youve lost and you say I wonder what soandso would think about this I was drivin on Interstate 40 and I saw a sign that said 19 Miles to Muskogee while at the same time listening to radio shows of The World Tomorrow radio and televisionThe World Tomorrow hosted by Garner Ted Armstrongref nameChapelle2007ref Muskogee was always referred to in my childhood as back home So I saw that sign and my whole childhood flashed before my eyes and I thought I wonder what dad would think about the youthful uprising that was occurring at the time the Janis Joplins I understood em I got along with it but what if he was to come alive at this moment And I thought what a way to describe the kind of people in America that are still sittin in the center of the country sayin What is goin on on these campuses as it was the subject of this Garner Ted Armstrong radio program And a week or so later I was listening to Garner Ted Armstrong and Armstrong was saying how the smaller colleges in smaller towns dont seem to have any problems  And I wondered if Muskogee had a college and it did and they hadnt had any trouble  no racial problems and no dope problems The whole thing hit me in two minutes and I did one line after another and got the whole thing done in 20 minutesref nameChapelle2007 refref In the American Masters documentary about him he said Thats how I got into it with the hippies I thought they were unqualified to judge America and I thought they were lookin down their noses at something that I cherished very much and it pissed me off And I thought You sons of bitches youve never been restricted away from this great wonderful country and yet here you are in the streets bitchin about things protesting about a war that they didnt know any more about than I did They werent over there fightin that war any more than I wasref nameAmericanMasters 

Haggard began performing the song in concert in 1969 and was astounded at the reaction it received



The studio version which was mellower than the usually raucous liveconcert versions topped the country charts in 1969 and remained there for a month It also hit number 41 on the Billboard allgenre singles chart becoming Haggards biggest hit up to that time surpassed only by his 1973 crossover Christmas hit If We Make It Through December which peaked at number 28ref namehagbillboardchartp1  Okie from Muskogee is also generally described as Haggards signature songrefref

On his next single The Fightin Side of Me released by his record company in 1970 over Haggards objections Haggards lyrics stated that he did not mind the counterculture switchin sides and standin up for what they believe in but resolutely declared If you dont love it leave it In May 1970 Haggard explained to John Grissom of Rolling Stone I dont like their views on life their filth their visible selfdisrespect yknow They dont give a shit what they look like or what they smell like What do they have to offer humanity In a 2003 interview with No Depression magazineNo Depression magazine Haggard said I had different views in the 70s As a human being Ive learned more I have more culture now I was dumb as a rock when I wrote Okie From Muskogee Thats being honest with you at the moment and a lot of things that I said then I sing with a different intention now My views on marijuana have totally changed I think we were brainwashed and I think anybody that doesnt know that needs to get up and read and look around get their own information Its a cooperative government project to make us think marijuana should be outlawedrefref

Haggard had wanted to follow Okie from Muskogee with Irma Jackson a song that dealt with an interracial romance between a white man and an African American woman His producer Ken Nelson United States record producerKen Nelson discouraged him from releasing it as a singleref nameautogenerated1962  Jonathan Bernstein recounts Hoping to distance himself from the harshly rightwing image he had accrued in the wake of the hippiebashing Muskogee Haggard wanted to take a different direction and release Irma Jackson as his next single When the Bakersfield California native brought the song to his record label executives were reportedly appalled In the wake of Okie Capitol Records was not interested in complicating Haggards conservative bluecollar imageref nameRSref

After The Fightin Side of Me was released instead Haggard later commented to The Wall Street Journal People are narrowminded Down South they might have called me a nigger lover In a 2001 interview Haggard stated that Nelson who was also head of the country division at Capitol at the time never interfered with his music but this one time he came out and said Merle I dont believe the world is ready for this yet  And he might have been right I mightve canceled out where I was headed in my careerref nameautogenerated1962 ref nameRS 

Okie From Muskogee The Fightin Side of Me and I Wonder If They Think of Me Haggards 1973 song about an American POW in Vietnam were hailed as anthems of the silent majority and have been recognized as part of a recurring patriotic trend in American country music that also includes Charlie Daniels In America and Lee Greenwoods God Bless the USArefrefrefref Although Gordon Friesen of Broadside magazine criticized Haggard for his John Birch SocietynowikinowikiJohnnowikinowiki Birchtype songs against war dissenters Haggard was popular with college students in the early 1970s not only because of the ironic use of his songs by counterculture of the 1960scounterculture members but also because his music was recognized as coming from an early countryfolk tradition Both Okie from Muskogee and The Fightin Side of Me received extensive airplay on underground radio stations and Okie was performed in concert by protest songprotest singers Arlo Guthrie and Phil Ochsref namekaufman 

Later career
