Guitar style
 in Birmingham Alabama
Emmanuel had said that even at a young age he was fascinated by Chet AtkinsChet Atkinss musical style sometimes referred to as Travis picking of playing bass lines chords melodies and harmonies simultaneously using the thumb and fingers of the right hand achieving a dynamic range of sound from the instrument Although Emmanuels playing incorporates a multitude of musical influences and styles including jazz blues bluegrass musicbluegrass folk musicfolk and rock this type of country musiccountry fingerstyle playing is at the core of his technique While Emmanuel has never had formal music training and does not read or write music his natural musical ability intrinsic sense of rhythm and charisma gained him fans from all over the world As a solo performer he never plays to a setlist and uses a minimum of effects onstageref namemusicfrisk  He usually completes studio recordings in one take

In his solo shows he mainly plays guitars made by Maton an Australian guitar manufacturer He usually travels with two custom Maton EBG808 TE models and one TE1 model both of which are Tommy Emmanuel artist signature modelsrefref He has played Maton guitars for most of his career and is somewhat of an ambassador for the company due to his longstanding association with the brandrefref Emmanuel is known for the battered and worndown appearances of his guitars a result of his dynamic energetic playing and percussive techniques One of his signature performances for example involves striking the whole body of the guitar in various places with his hands or a drummers Drum brushBrushessnaredrum brush to emulate the sound of a percussion kit

Emmanuel usually keeps one Maton EBG808 in standard guitar tuning EADGBE while he tunes his second Maton EBG808 to DGDGBE G6 tuning and his TE1 to CFBEGC He generally uses 012 gauge light strings on one EBG808 and 013 gauge medium strings on the second Maton EBG808 and on the TE1 This allows him to quickly change tuning by swapping between guitars during a show if needed rather than spending time onstage retuning one guitar

Emmanuel often curls his left thumb around the neck of the guitar onto the fretboard to play some notes rather than using only his fingers to play  contrary to how classical guitarists play but not unusual for jazz and country guitarists He frequently plays common threefinger chord shapes with just two fingers He commonly uses a thumbpick a flat pick plectrum his fingers or a combination of these in his playing a style known as hybrid picking Amongst his trademark rapid virtuoso licks and cascading harmonic progressions he often uses a technique that imitated an electric guitars tremolo system on acoustic guitar  by pressing the palm of his right hand against the Sound board musicsound board of the guitar near the neck joint while maintaining forward pressure with his left hand on the top of the headstock The guitar neck slightly bends away from the body and consequently affects the pitch of the strings to achieve the desired sound

Influences
As a young man in Australia Emmanuel wrote to his hero Chet Atkins in Nashville Tennessee Eventually Atkins replied with words of encouragement and a longstanding invitation to drop by to visitrefref

In 1997 Emmanuel and Atkins recorded as a duo releasing the album The Day Finger Pickers Took Over the World It would be Atkinss last album with the exception of Solo Sessions which Atkins estate released posthumouslyrefref Emmanuel and Atkins appeared together on The Nashville Networks Country Christmas in late 1997 and on that occasion Atkins stated about him He is one of the greatest guitar players Ive ever seen Atkins gave Emmanuel the guitar on which Arthur Guitar Boogie Smith recorded Guitar Boogie one of the foundation performances of the blues guitar world and a regular feature of Emmanuels shows

In July 1999 at the 15th Annual Chet Atkins Appreciation Society Conventionrefref Atkins presented Emmanuel with a Certified Guitar Player award an honour Chet personally bestowed to only four guitaristsref namepritcher  This award gains its fame from being bestowed by Atkins himself a widely recognised leader in guitar music The award states In Recognition of His Contributions to the Art of Fingerpicking Tommy performed at the Chet Atkins Appreciation Society CAAS in July each year in Nashvillerefref

In addition to being influenced by Chet Atkins Emmanuel has stated that he and his brother Phil Emmanuel were inspired by and modelled themselves on Hank Marvin and Bruce Welch of the Shadowsrefref
