Round the Wheel released in 1998 refined the bands sound and displayed a marked increase in both musical and lyrical maturity and added Paul McCandless as a guest player on soprano saxophonesoprano and tenor saxophone and Tony Furtado on banjo but did not earn them quite the level of fame that they would achieve in the next millennium From 1998 through 2001 SCI toured the country extensively and steadily playing over 500 Incidents in hundreds of cities including an appearance at Woodstock 99

Monroe was born on Bill Monroe Farmhis familys farm near Rosine Kentucky the youngest of eight children of James Buchanan Buck and Malissa Vandiver Monroe His mother and her brother Pendleton VandiverJames Pendleton Pen Vandiver were both musically talented and Monroe and his family grew up playing and singing at homeref nameLarkinGE

Bill was of Scottish AmericansScottish and English AmericansEnglish heritage Because his older brothers Birch and Charlie MonroeCharlie already played the fiddle and guitar Bill was resigned to playing the less desirable mandolinref nameLarkinGE He recalled that his brothers insisted that he remove four of the mandolins eight strings so he would not play too loudly

Monroes mother died when he was ten and his father died six years laterref nameLarkinGE Eventually his brothers and sisters moved away leaving Monroe to bounce between uncles and aunts until finally settling in with his disabled uncle Pendleton Vandiver whom he often accompanied when Vandiver played the fiddle at dances This experience inspired one of Monroes most famous compositions Uncle Pen recorded in 1950ref nameLarkinGE and the 1972 album Bill Monroes Uncle Pen On that album Monroe recorded a number of traditional fiddle tunes he had often heard performed by Vandiver Vandiver has been credited with giving Monroe a repertoire of tunes that sank into Bills aurally trained memory and a sense of rhythm that seeped into his bonesrefref

Also significant in Monroes musical life was Arnold Shultz an influential fiddler and guitarist who introduced Monroe to the bluesrefrefrefThe Father of Bluegrass Music DVD Documentary 1993ref

Professional career
In 1929 Monroe moved to Indiana to work at an oil refinery with his brothers Birch MonroeBirch and Charlieref nameLarkinGE Together with a friend Larry Moore they formed the Monroe Brothers to play at local dances and house parties

Birch and Moore soon left the group and Bill and Charlie carried on as a duo eventually winning spots performing live on radio stations first in Indiana and then sponsored by Texas Crystals on several radio broadcasts in Shenandoah Iowa Nebraska South Carolina and North Carolina from 1934 to 1936ref nameLarkinGE RCA RecordsPrevious labelsRCA Victor signed the Monroe Brothers to a recording contract in 1936ref nameLarkinGE They scored an immediate hit single with the gospel song What Would You Give in Exchange For Your Soul and ultimately recorded 60 tracks for Victors Bluebird RecordsBluebird label between 1936 and 1938refref

After the Monroe Brothers disbanded in 1938 Bill Monroe formed The Kentuckians in Little Rock Arkansas but the group only lasted for three monthsref nameLarkinGE Monroe then left Little Rock for Atlanta Georgia to form the first edition of the Blue Grass Boysref nameLarkinGE with singerguitarist Cleo Davis fiddler Art Wooten and bassist Amos Garren

In October 1939 Monroe successfully auditioned for a regular spot on the Grand Ole Opry impressing Opry founder George D Hay with his energetic performance of Jimmie Rodgers country singerJimmie Rodgerss Mule Skinner Bluesref nameLarkinGE Monroe recorded that song along with seven others at his first solo recording session for RCA Victor in 1940 by this time the Blue Grass Boys consisted of singerguitarist Clyde Moody fiddler Tommy Magness and bassist Bill Wesbrooksrefref

While the fast tempos and instrumental virtuosity characteristic of bluegrass music are apparent even on these early tracks Monroe was still experimenting with the sound of his group He seldom sang lead vocals on his Victor recordings often preferring to contribute high tenor harmonies as he had in the Monroe Brothers A 1945 session for Columbia Records featured an accordion soon dropped from the band Most importantly Monroe added banjo player David Stringbean Akeman to the Blue Grass Boys in 1942ref nameLarkinGE Akeman played the instrument in a relatively primitive style and was rarely featured in instrumental solos Monroes pre1946 recordings represent a transitional style between the string bandstringband tradition from which he came and the musical innovation to follow

 Original Bluegrass Band and Monroes heyday as a star 

Key developments occurred in Monroes music with the addition of Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs to the Blue Grass Boys in December 1945ref nameLarkinGE Flatt played a solid rhythm guitar style that would help to set the course for bluegrass timing Scruggs played the banjo with a distinctive threefinger picking style that immediately caused a sensation among Opry audiences Flatt and Scruggs joined a highly accomplished group that included fiddler Howdy Forrester and bassist Joe Forrester and would soon include fiddler Chubby Wise and bassist Howard Watts who often performed under the name Cedric Rainwater

In retrospect this lineup of the Blue Grass Boys has been dubbed the Original Bluegrass Band as the music finally included all the elements that characterize bluegrass music including breakneck tempos sophisticated vocal harmony arrangements and impressive instrumental proficiency demonstrated in solos or breaks on the mandolin banjo and fiddle By this time Monroe had acquired the 1923 Gibson F5 model Lloyd Loar mandolin which became his trademark instrument for the remainder of his careerrefRosenberg Neil V 2005 BLUEGRASS A History Urbana Ill University of Illinois Press ref

The 28 songs recorded by this version of the Blue Grass Boys for Columbia Records in 1946 and 1947 soon became classics of the genre including Toy Heart Blue Grass Breakdown Molly and Tenbrooks Wicked Path of Sin My Rose of Old Kentucky Little Cabin Home on the Hill and Monroes most famous song Blue Moon of Kentuckyref nameLarkinGE which was recorded by Elvis Presley in 1954 appearing as the Bside of his first single for Sun Records Monroe gave his blessing to Presleys rock and roll cover of the song originally a slow ballad in waltz time and rerecorded it himself with a faster arrangement after Presleys version became a hitref nameLarkinGE Several gospelthemed numbers are credited to the Blue Grass Quartet which featured fourpart vocal arrangements accompanied solely by mandolin and guitar  Monroes usual practice when performing sacred songs

Both Flatt and Scruggs left Monroes band in early 1948 soon forming their own group the Foggy Mountain Boys In 1949 after signing with Decca Records Monroe entered what has been called the golden age of his careerrefBill Monroe and Bluegrass by Roughstock staff January 27 2009 ref with what many consider the classic high lonesome version of the Blue Grass Boys featuring the lead vocals and rhythm guitar of Jimmy Martin the banjo of Rudy Lyle replacing Don Reno and fiddlers such as Merle Red Taylor Charlie Cline Bobby Hicks and Vassar Clements

This band recorded a number of bluegrass classics including My Little Georgia Rose On and On Memories of Mother and Dad and Uncle Pen as well as instrumentals such as Roanoke Big Mon Stoney Lonesome Get Up John and the mandolin feature Raw Hide Carter Stanley joined the Blue Grass Boys as guitarist for a short time in 1951 during a period when The Stanley Brothers had temporarily disbanded

On January 16 1953 Monroe was critically injured in a twocar wreckref nameLarkinGE He and Bluegrass Boys bass player Bessie Lee Mauldin were returning home from a fox hunt north of Nashville TennesseeNashville On highway 31W near White House their car was struck by a drunken driver Monroe who had suffered injuries to his back left arm and nose was rushed to General Hospital in Nashville It took him almost four months to recover and resume touringref nameLarkinGE In the meantime Charlie Cline and Jimmy Martin kept the band togetherref nameRosenberg

By the late 1950s however Monroes commercial fortunes had begun to slipref nameLarkinGE The rise of rockandroll and the development of the Nashville sound in mainstream country music both represented threats to the viability of bluegrass While still a mainstay on the Grand Ole Opry Monroe found diminishing success on the singles charts and struggled to keep his band together in the face of declining demand for live performances

Folk revival

Monroes fortunes began to improve during the American folk music revival of the early 1960s Many college students and other young people were beginning to discover Monroe associating his style more with traditional folk music than with the countryandwestern genre with which it had previously been identified

The word bluegrass first appeared around this time to describe the sound of Monroe and similar artists such as Flatt and Scruggs the Stanley Brothers Reno and Smiley Jim  JesseJim and Jesse and the Osborne Brothers While Flatt and Scruggs immediately recognized the potential for a lucrative new audience in cities and on college campuses in the North Monroe was slower to respond Under the influence of Ralph Rinzler a young musician and folklorist from New Jersey who briefly became Monroes manager in 1963 Monroe gradually expanded his geographic reach beyond the traditional southern country music circuitref nameLarkinGE Rinzler was also responsible for a lengthy profile and interview in the influential folk music magazine Sing Out that first publicly referred to Monroe as the father of bluegrass Accordingly at the first bluegrass festival organized by Carlton Haney at Roanoke Virginia in 1965 Bill Monroe was the central figureref nameLarkinGE

In 1964 before the Grateful Dead got together Jerry Garcia caravanned across the country from California to tag along with Monroerefref

The growing national popularity of Monroes music during the 1960s was also apparent in the increasingly diverse background of musicians recruited into his band Nonsoutherners who served as Blue Grass Boys during this period included banjo player Bill Keith musicianBill Keith and singerguitarist Peter Rowan from Massachusettsref nameLarkinGE fiddler Gene Lowinger from New Jersey banjo player Lamar Grier from Maryland banjo player Steve Arkin from New York and singerguitarist Roland White and fiddler Richard Greene musicianRichard Greene from California

Later years
 He founded the Hall in 1984
Even after the folk revival faded in the mid1960s it left a loyal audience for bluegrass music Bluegrass festivals became common with fans often traveling long distances to see a number of different acts over several days of performances

In 1967 Monroe himself founded an annual bluegrass festival at Beanblossom IndianaBean Blossom in southern Indiana a park he had purchased in 1951ref nameLarkinGE which routinely attracted a crowd of thousands a double LP from the festival featuring Monroe Jimmy Martin Lester Flatt and Jim and Jesse was released in 1973 The annual Bill Monroe Bean Blossom Bluegrass Festival is now the worlds oldest continuously running annual bluegrass festivalrefref

Monroes compositions during his later period were largely instrumentals including Jerusalem Ridge Old Dangerfield originally spelled Daingerfield after Daingerfield Texasthe town in East TexasrefStoney Lonesome Fiddle Book by Stacy Phillipsref and My Last Days on Earth he settled into a new role as a musical patriarch who continued to influence younger generations of musicians Monroe recorded two albums of duets in the 1980s the first featured collaborations with country stars such as Emmylou Harris Waylon Jennings and The Oak Ridge Boys while the second paired him with other prominent bluegrass musiciansref nameLarkinGE A 1989 live album celebrated his 50th year on the Grand Ole Opryref nameLarkinGE Monroe also kept a hectic touring scheduleref nameLarkinGE On April 7 1990 Monroe performed for Farm AidFarm Aid IV in Indianapolis Indiana along with Willie Nelson John Mellencamp Neil Young and with many other artistsrefref

 Death 
Monroes last performance occurred on March 15 1996 He ended his touring and playing career in April following a stroke Monroe died on September 9 1996 in Springfield Tennessee four days before his 85th birthdayref nameFlipporefrefref

 Legacy and influence 

According to Ralph Rinzler Bill Monroe impacted music in the following five waysrefref

 When others were going electric Bill created a space for an acoustic string band tradition to continue to grow and develop within country music
 He developed a distinct vocal tradition  the high lonesome sound
 He established the mandolin as a virtuoso string band instrument
 He composed a diverse repertoire of songs and instrumental tunes which have become standard fare among bluegrass country and some pop musicians
 More than any other musician of his time he skillfully infused country music with archaic tonal subtlety including AngloScotsIrish and Blues influences

Bill Monroe was made an honorary Kentucky Colonel in 1966ref nameRosenbergref He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame and MuseumCountry Music Hall of Fame in 1970ref nameLarkinGE  the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1971ref nameLarkinGE  and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as an early influence in 1997 Jimmie Rodgers country singerJimmie Rodgers Bob Wills Hank WilliamsHank Williams Sr and Johnny Cash are the only other performers honored in all three As the father of bluegrass he was also an inaugural inductee into the International Bluegrass Music Hall of FameInternational Bluegrass Music Hall of Honor in 1991 Monroe was a recipient of a 1982 National Heritage Fellowship awarded by the National Endowment for the Arts which is the United States governments highest honor in the folk and traditional artsrefref That years fellowships were the first bestowed by the NEA In 1993 he received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and he was awarded the List of recipients of the National Medal of ArtsNational Medal of Arts in 1995 His wellknown song Blue Moon of Kentucky has been covered not only by bluegrass but also rock and country artists most notably Elvis Presley Paul McCartney and Patsy Cline In 2003 CMT American TV channelCMT had Bill Monroe ranked Nonbsp16 on CMT 40 Greatest Men of Country Music

Artists that claimed to be influenced by or to be playing the bluegrass genre were often bullied by Bill Monroe He always considered himself the father and caretaker of bluegrass He would often say of new bands that did not perform to his standards That aint no part of nothin Even those who question the scope of bluegrass refer to Monroe as a musical giant and recognize that there would be no bluegrass without Bill Monroerefref

More than 150 musicians played in the Blue Grass Boys over the nearly 60 years of Monroes performing career Monroe tended to recruit promising young musicians who served an apprenticeship with him before becoming accomplished artists in their own right Some of Monroes band members who went on to greater prominence include singerguitarists Clyde Moody Lester Flatt Jack Cook Mac Wiseman Jimmy Martin Carter Stanley Del McCoury Peter Rowan Roland White Roland Dunn and Riders in the Sky bandDoug Green banjo players Earl Scruggs Bob Black Butch Robins Buck Trent Don Reno David Stringbean AkemanStringbean Osborne BrothersSonny Osborne and Bill Keith musicianBill Keith and fiddlers Tommy Magness Chubby Wise Vassar Clements Byron Berline Kenny Baker fiddlerKenny Baker Bobby Hicks Gordon Terry Randall Franks and Glen Duncan Monroe also regularly performed with flatpicking guitar virtuoso Doc Watson

Modern bluegrass singer and mandolin player Ricky Skaggs was influenced by Monroe Skaggs was only six years old in 1960 when he first got to perform on stage with Monroe and his band at the high school in Martha Kentucky He stated I think Bill Monroes importance to American music is as important as someone like Robert Johnson was to blues or Louis Armstrong He was so influential I think hes probably the only musician that had a whole style of music named after his bandref nameMusicref

In 1999 the portion of Indiana State Road 135 running from Morgantown IndianaMorgantown through to Nashville Indiana was dedicated to Bill Monroe and is known as the Bill Monroe Memorial Highwayrefref

Biography

Clements was born in Kinard Floridaref nameLarkinCountryref and grew up in Kissimmee FloridaKissimmee He taught himself to play the fiddle at age 7 learning Theres an Old Spinning Wheel in the Parlor as his first song Soon he joined with two first cousins Red and Gerald to form a local string band In his early teens Clements met Bill Monroe and the Blue Grass Boys when they came to Florida to visit Clements stepfather a friend of fiddler Chubby Wise Clements was impressed with his playing

In late 1949 Wise left Monroes group and the 21 yearold Clements traveled by bus to ask for an audition When told he would have to return the next day Clements was crestfallen lacking the money for either a hotel room or return bus trip Monroe gave him some money to a nights lodging and the next day Clements auditioned and was hired He remained with Monroe for seven years recording with the band in 1950 and 1951ref nameLarkinCountry

Between 1957 and 1962 he was a member of the bluegrass musicbluegrass band Jim and Jesse  the Virginia Boysref nameLarkinCountry  He also gained recognition joining with the popular bluegrass duo of Flatt and Scruggs on the popular theme to the hit television sitcom The Beverly Hillbillies Earl Scruggs pathbreaking banjo style had premiered with Bill Monroe in the late 1940s and thereafter gained widespread renown with Lester Flatt and the Foggy Mountain Boys

By the mid1960s however his struggles with alcohol left him making his living in Bluecollar workerbluecollar trades being employed briefly at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida as a plumber in a Georgia US stateGeorgia paper mill and as switchman for Atlantic Coast Line Railroad  He even sold insurance and once operated a convenience store while owning a potato chip franchisingfranchise in Huntsville Alabama Sobering up he returned to Nashville TennesseeNashville in 1967 where he became a much soughtafter studio musician

After a brief touring stint with Faron Young he joined John Hartfords Dobrolic Plectral Society in 1971ref nameLarkinCountry when he met guitarist Norman Blake American musicianNorman Blake and Dobro player Tut Taylor and recorded AereoPlain a widely acclaimed newgrass album that helped broaden the bluegrass market and sound After less than a year he joined up with Earl Scruggsref nameLarkinCountry

His 1972 work with the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band on their album Will the Circle be Unbroken Nitty Gritty Dirt Band albumWill the Circle be Unbroken earned even wider acclaim and he later worked on the Grateful Deads Wake of the Flood and Jimmy Buffetts A White Sport Coat and a Pink Crustaceanref nameLarkinCountry Within the next two years Clements would cut his first solo album

In 1973 he joined and toured with the bluegrass supergroup Old  In the Way with Jerry Garciaref nameLarkinCountry David Grisman Peter Rowan and John Kahn their selftitled live album Old  In the Way albumOld  In the Way was released in 1975

In 1974 he lent his talents to Highway Call a solo album by former Allman Brothers Band guitarist Dickey Betts
He was considered by many to be an outstanding fiddle virtuoso and he described his talent saying 

In his 50year career he played with artists ranging from Woody Herman and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band to the Grateful Dead Linda Ronstadt and Paul McCartney and earned at least five Grammy Award nominations and numerous professional accolades He once recorded with the pop group the Monkees by happenstance when he stayed behind after an earlier recording session He also appeared in Robert Altmans 1975 film Nashville filmNashvilleref nameLarkinCountry and Alan Rudolphs 1976 film Welcome to LA He made a duet album with Stéphane Grappelli Together at Last in 1987

In 2004 he performed in concert with jazz quartet Third Stream  in which a video documentary of the concert was done with Jim Easton guitar Tom Strohman sax Jim Miller bass and John Peifer drumsrefref

Though he played numerous instruments Clements indicated that he chose the fiddle over guitar recalling that I picked up a guitar and fiddle and tried them both out The guitar was pretty easy but I couldnt get nothing out of the fiddle So every time Id see those instruments sitting side by side Id grab that fiddle

Big band and swing music were considerable influences upon his style and musical development and he said that Bands like Glenn Miller Les Brown bandleaderLes Brown Tommy Dorsey Harry James and Artie Shaw were very popular when I was a kid I always loved rhythm so I guess in the back of my mind the swing and jazz subconsciously comes out when I play because when I was learning I was always trying to emulate the bigband sounds I heard on my fiddle

Vassar Clements played on over 200 albums including nearly 40 on which he starred or was featured His albums often featured newgrass style music and what Clements called Hillbilly Jazz His last album Livin With the Blues released in 2004 was his only blues recording it featured guest appearances by Elvin Bishop Norton Buffalo Maria Muldaur and others

Another member of the Country Gentlemen Charlie Waller American musicianCharlie Waller is responsible for the bands name Expressing his doubt that this new band could succeed Waller reportedly asked Duffey What are you going to call yourselves the seldom seenref nameCountry Music Encyclopediaref The band had weekly performances at clubs and performed regularly at the Red Fox Inn a music club in Bethesda Maryland The band switched over to the The BirchmereBirchmere music hall in Alexandria Virginia which resulted in a residencyref nameSmithsonian 

Members backgrounds
Each of the band members had a job during the week Duffey repaired musical instruments Eldridge was a mathematician Starling a physicianref nameenc  Auldridge a graphic artist and Gray a cartographer with National Geographic MagazineNational Geographicref namerosenberg  They agreed to play one night a week at local clubs perform occasionally at concerts and festivals on weekends and make records After playing for six weeks at a small Washington DC club called the Rabbits Foot the group found a home at the Red Fox Inn in Bethesda Marylandref nameCountry Music Encyclopedia They performed at that venue Friday nights from January 1972 through September 1977 before starting weekly performances at the Birchmere music hallref nameIBMA Scene at Red Foxref

Rise to popularity 19721976
The progressive bluegrass style played by the Seldom Scene had become increasingly popular during the 1970s especially Duffeys high tenor and the vocal blend of DuffeyStarlingAuldridgeref nameenc  Their weekly shows included bluegrass versions of country music rock and even classical popref nameenc  The bands popularity soon forced them to play more than once a weekref nameenc  but they continued to maintain their image as being seldom seen and on several of their early album covers were photographed with the stage lights on only their feet or with their backs to the camera Though the Scene remained a nontouring band they were prolific recorders producing seven albums in their first five years of existence including one live album among the first live bluegrass albumsref nameAllmusic Scene discographyref

John Starlings departure and Phil Rosenthal as lead singer 19771986
In 1977 John Starling left the group to focus on his medical career and was replaced by singer and songwriter Phil Rosenthal whose song Muddy Water had been recorded by the Scene on two earlier albums Starling and Rosenthal shared their lead vocals on the groups sixth studio album Baptizing albumBaptizing recorded in 1978 Around the same time the group switched record labels from Rebel RecordsRebel to Sugar Hill Records bluegrass labelSugar Hill Starling recorded a solo album for Sugar Hill in 1980 called Long Time Gone and another in 1982 called Waitin On a Southern Train on both of which Mike Auldridge played

The lineup of RosenthalDuffeyGrayAuldridgeEldridge recorded five albums of a comparable popularity to the ones with the founding members including John Starling Rosenthal proved to be as good lead singer as Starling and his baritone voice contrasted well with Duffeys high tenor extravaganzas He also wrote typically two to three songs on each of the albums and also added acoustic guitar solos to the groupref Album  AllMusic urlhttpswwwallmusiccomalbumactfourmw0000646266 accessdate20240711 languageen archivedate20231104 archiveurlhttpswebarchiveorgweb20231104151257httpswwwallmusiccomalbumactfourmw0000646266 urlstatuslive ref

More changes in lineup 19861996
In 1986 Phil Rosenthal and Tom Gray both left the band to focus on other pursuits and were replaced by Lou Reid and T Michael Coleman respectively Coleman proved to be very controversial as many purists objected to his use of an electric bass in what is nominally an acoustic genre but the albums produced by the band after Colemans arrival maintained the traditional appeal of any of the Scenes earlier albums

Reid left the band in 1992 and Duffey convinced former member John Starling to return to the band for the next yearref nameallbookref During that year the Scene recorded the album Like We Used to Be albumLike We Used to Be but Starling did not wish to stay with the band long term He was replaced in 1994 by lead singer Moondi Kleinref nameenc 

Throughout these changes band leader John Duffeys original plan of keeping a light touring schedule and staying close to home continued to prevail During 1995 and 1996 Klein and Coleman along with original member Mike Auldridge wanting to be part of a fulltime project left the Seldom Scene to form a new band called Chesapeake bandChesapeakeref nameallbook  For a time the Scene stopped recording

Early years
Clarence Joseph LeBlanc was born on June 7 1944 in Lewiston Maineref nameKingsbury The LeBlanc family who later changed their surname to White were of FrenchCanadian ancestry and hailed from New Brunswick Canadaref nameKingsburyref namebyrdwatcherref  Clarences father Eric LeBlanc Sr played Steelstring guitarguitar banjo fiddle and harmonica ensuring that his offspring grew up surrounded by musicref nameKingsburyref namebyrdwatcher  A child prodigy Clarence began playing guitar at the age of sixref nameroganref  At such a young age he was barely able to hold the instrument and as a result he briefly switched to ukulele awaiting a time when his young hands would be big enough to confidently grapple with the guitarref nametimeless

In 1954 when Clarence was ten the White family relocated to Burbank California and soon after Clarence joined his brothers Roland WhiteRoland and Eric Jr who played mandolin and banjo respectively in a trio called Three Little Country Boysref namehjort  Although they initially started out playing contemporary country music the group soon switched to a purely Bluegrass musicbluegrass repertoire as a result of Rolands burgeoning interest in the genreref nameKingsbury

In 1957 banjoist Billy Ray Latham and Dobro player LeRoy Mack were added to the lineupref nametimeless with the band renaming themselves the Country Boys soon afterref namehjort In 1961 the Country Boys also added Roger Bush on double bass as a replacement for Eric White Jrref namehjort  That same year Clarence and other members of the Country Boys appeared on two episodes of The Andy Griffith Showref namehjort  Between 1959 and 1962 the group released three Single musicsingles on the Sundown Republic and Briar International record labelsref namediscref

The Kentucky Colonels

Following the recording sessions for the Country Boys debut album the band changed its name to the Kentucky Colonels bandKentucky Colonels in September 1962 at the suggestion of country guitarist and friend Joe Maphisref namehjort  The bands album was released by Briar International under the title The New Sound of Bluegrass America in early 1963ref nametimeless2ref

Around this time Clarences flatpicking guitar style was becoming a much more prominent part of the groups musicref nameKingsbury  After attending a performance by Doc Watson at the Ash Grove music clubAsh Grove folk club in Los Angeles where he also met the guitarist Clarence began to explore the possibilities of the acoustic guitars role in bluegrass musicref nameKingsbury  At that time the guitar was largely regarded as a rhythm instrument in bluegrass with only a few performers such as  Watson exploring its potential for soloingref nameKingsbury  White soon began to integrate elements of Watsons playing styleincluding the use of open strings and syncopationinto his own flatpicking guitar techniqueref namebyrdwatcher  His breathtaking speed and virtuosity on the instrumentref nametimeless2 was largely responsible for making the guitar a lead instrument within bluegrassrefref

The Kentucky Colonels became well known on the bluegrass circuit during this period and made many live appearances throughout California and the United Statesref namehjort  Between bookings with the Colonels White also made a guest appearance on Eric Weissberg and Marshall Brickmans New Dimensions in Banjo  Bluegrass album which would be rereleased in 1973 as the soundtrack album to the film Deliverance with Weissberg and Steve Mandells version of Dueling Banjos added to the albums track listingref namebyrdwatcherreftitleDueling Banjos from the Original Soundtrack Deliverance album reviewlastJohnsonfirstZacwebsiteAllmusicpublisherRovi Corpaccessdate20130813ref

In 1964 the Colonels recruited fiddle player Bobby Sloan and continued to make live appearances at various clubs concert halls and festivalsref namehjort The Colonels second album Appalachian Swingref nametimeless2 was a commercial success and saw Whites flatpicking permanently expand the language of bluegrass guitarref namehjort2ref Music critic Thom Owens has remarked that Whites playing on the album helped pioneer a new style in bluegrass namely he redefined the acoustic guitar as a solo instrumentref nameallmusic2titleAppalachian Swing album reviewlastOwensfirstThomwebsiteAllmusicpublisherRovi Corpaccessdate20130813ref

Shortly after the recording of the Appalachian Swing album Roland and Clarence undertook some Session musiciansession work backing dobroist Tut Taylor on a Dobrothemed album that was released by World Pacific Records in late 1964 as Dobro Countryref namebyrdwatcher  Although the brothers were employed as session musicians the album was credited to Tut Taylor Roland and Clarence White upon releaseref namebyrdwatcher

Although the Colonels were a successful recording act it was becoming increasingly difficult for them to make a living due to the waning popularity of the American folk music revival due to the British Invasion and homegrown folk rock acts such as the Byrds and Bob Dylanref namebyrdwatcher  As a result the Colonels switched to electric instrumentationref namebyrdwatcher and hired a drummerrefref  In spite of these changes the Kentucky Colonels dissolved as a band following a show on October 31 1965ref nametimeless2  Clarence Roland and Eric Jr formed a new lineup of the Colonels in 1966 with several other musicians but this second version of the group was shortlived and by early 1967 they had broken upref namebyrdwatcher2ref

Session work 19661968
During 1964 White began to look beyond bluegrass music towards rock n roll as an avenue for artistic expressionref nametimeless  Although he was influenced by Country guitarists like Doc Watson Don Reno and Joe Maphis he also idolized the playing of jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt rock n roller Chuck Berry and studio musician James Burtonref namebyrdwatcher2  White even anticipated the viability of a folkrock hybrid when in the summer of 1964 he was approached by Jim Dickson to record a version of the thenunreleased Bob Dylan song Mr Tambourine Man with electric instrumentsref nametimeless  However despite Whites enthusiasm for the project he was unable to convince his bandmates in the Kentucky Colonels of the experiments validityref nametimeless and ultimately the song was instead recorded by Dicksons proteges the Byrdsrefref

By the time the original lineup of the Kentucky Colonels folded in late 1965 White had become a respected and wellknown guitaristref nametimeless  Abandoning bluegrass temporarily he switched from his Martin D28 acoustic guitar to an electric Fender Telecaster with the intention of becoming a studio musician like his hero James Burtonref namelightning  Transitioning to electric guitar required White to modify his right hand playing technique switch from open chording to fretting the whole Neck musicguitar neck with his left hand and practice using the tone and volume controlsref namelightning  However he soon mastered the intricacies of the instrument and between 1965 and 1968 he undertook session work for artists including Ricky Nelson the Monkees and the Vern GosdinGosdin Brothersref nametimelessref namebyrdwatcher2 
  
As 1965 turned into 1966 White met Gene Parsons and Gib Guilbeau at a recording session for the Gosdin Brothers and shortly after he began to perform live with the duo in local California clubs as well as doing regular session work on their records which were released under the moniker of Cajun Gib and Generef nameallmusicref namebyrdwatcher2  1966 also saw White begin playing with a country group called Trio which featured drummer Bart Haney and former Kentucky Colonel Roger Bush on bassref namebyrdwatcher2  In autumn of that year as a result of his friendship with Gilbeau Parsons and the Gosdin Brothers White was asked to provide lead guitar to exByrd Gene Clarks debut solo album Gene Clark with the Gosdin Brothersref nameallmusicrefref  White briefly joined Clarks touring band shortly thereafterrefref

During the Clark album sessions White reconnected with mandolin player and bassist Chris Hillman who he had known during the early 1960s as a member of the bluegrass combo the Hillmenref namehjort3ref  Hillman was currently a member of the Byrds and in December 1966 he invited White to contribute countrified lead guitar playing to his songs Time Between and The Girl with No Name which both appeared on the Byrds Younger Than Yesterday albumref namehjort3  The countryoriented nature of the songs was something of a stylistic departure for the group and can be seen as an early indicator of the experimentation with country music that would color the Byrds subsequent workrefref  White also contributed guitar to the bands followup album The Notorious Byrd Brothersrefref and to their seminal 1968 country rock release Sweetheart of the Rodeoref nameallmusic3ref

Nashville West


By mid1967 White had begun performing at night in the band the Reasons aka Nashville West which included bass player Wayne Moore along with Parsons and Guilbeau as banjoistturneddrummer and lead singer respectivelyref namehjort4ref  The band mostly worked at the Nashville West club in El Monte California frequently borrowing the clubs name as their ownref namehjort4  Critic Erik Hage has said that in the years since their formation the band have become legendary as one of the first to play a seamless blend of country and rockref nameallmusic3 although LA group the International Submarine Band which featured country rock pioneer Gram Parsons no relation to Gene were also exploring a similar sound concurrentlyrefref

The StringBender

During 1967 while they were both members of Nashville West White and Parsons invented a device that enabled Clarence to simulate the sound of a pedal steel guitar on his 1954 Fender Telecasterref namebyrdwatcher3ref  The need for such a device was driven by Whites desire to bend his guitars Strings musicBstring up a full Major secondtone while keeping his left hand on the strings and Fingerboardfretboardref namehjort5ref  In order to achieve this feat White felt that he needed a third handref namebyrdwatcher3  The guitarist turned to his friend Parsons who was an amateur machinist and asked him to design and build an apparatus to pull or drop the Bstringref namebyrdwatcher3

The device which was known as the ParsonsWhite StringBender also known as the BBender was a springlever mechanism built into the inside of Whites guitar which linked to the guitars strap button and the Bstringref nameKingsburyref namehjort5  When it was activated by pulling down on the guitar neck it pulled on the Bstring and caused the guitar to simulate the crying sound of a pedal steelref nameKingsbury  White would go on to use the device extensively as a member of the Byrds and as a result the distinctive sound of the StringBender would become a defining characteristic of that bands music during Whites tenure with the grouprefref

Following the abrupt departure from the Byrds of singer and guitarist Gram Parsons in July 1968refref White was invited to join the group as a fulltime member He remained until the band was finally dissolved by lead guitarist Roger McGuinn in February 1973  This extended tenure with the band makes White the second longestserving member of the Byrds after McGuinnref namefrickeref  White was brought into the group at Bassistbass player Chris Hillmans suggestion as someone who could handle the bands older rock material and their newer countryflavored repertoireref namebyrdwatcher4ref

Death

Musical influence
Clarence White helped popularize the acoustic guitar as a lead instrument in bluegrass music building on the work of guitarists such as Doc Watson Prior to the advent of the more aggressive flatpicking style pioneered by guitarists like Watson and White the guitar was strictly a rhythm instrument save for a few exceptions such as the occasional guitar track by banjoist Don Reno Many of the most influential flatpickers of the 20th century cite White as a primary influence including Dan Crary Norman Blake American musicianNorman Blake and Tony Rice  Rice owned and played Whites highly modified 1935 CF Martin  CompanyMartin D28 David Grier and Russ Barenberg are two other acoustic guitarists who were heavily influenced by Whites guitar work  Whites bluegrass playing with the Kentucky Colonels was also a considerable influence on Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Deadref namelightning who traveled with the band during 1964refref

On the electric side of the guitar spectrum White was similarly influential Together with fellow Byrds bandmember Gene Parsons White invented the BBender device This device raises the Bstring second string of the guitar a whole step by the use of pulleys and levers attached to both the upper strap knob and the second string on the guitar It is activated by pushing down on the neck and produces a pedal steel type sound Arlen Roth heavily influenced by this style did not at the time know that White and Parsons had invented a Bbender so instead developed his own unique allfinger bending version of this technique This was heavily documented in his groundbreaking book Nashville Guitar all of his recordings as well as his book Masters of the Telecaster Subsequently his Telecaster sound became as notable as his bluegrass playing Marty Stuart another guitarist influenced by Whites playing now owns and regularly plays Whites 1954 Fender Telecaster with the prototype BBenderrefhttpwwwmartystuartcomZArtGuitarPlayer894htm Gill Chris Steel And Wood Heart And Soul  The Marty Stuart Guitar Collection reprinted from Guitar Player Magazine August 1994ref

Music archivist and writer Alec Palao has called White one of a handful of true greats amongst the instrumentalists of 20th century popular music before adding that the waves created by the guitarists idiosyncratic style are still forming ripples within bluegrass country and rock n rollrefref  In 2003 White was ranked Nonbsp41 on Rolling Stone magazines list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time In 2010 guitar manufacturer Gibson Guitar CorporationGibson ranked White at Nonbsp42 on their Top 50 Guitarists of All Time listrefref

 East Coast Bluegrass Band 
The East Coast Bluegrass Band was the predecessor to Nothin Fancy formed in 1985 It was formed to compete in the East Coast Bluegrass Championship in Crimora Virginiaref namebelleville  In 1986 the group won the Virginia Folk Music Society State Bluegrass Band Championshipref namesamhillbandscomhttpwwwsamhillbandscombandseastcoastindexshtml Biography East Coast Bluegrass Band Sam Hill Entertainmentref After winning the contest the band continued to play together at local functions   The members of the band developed some original material but remained true to the traditional style of the great bluegrass bands of the 1940s and 1950sref namesamhillbandscom Nothin Fancy was formed in 1994 Mike Andes and Mitchell Davis joined forces with Gary Farris on guitar Tony Shorter on bass and Guy Carawan on fiddle to play the same East Coast Bluegrass Championship in September 1994 that East Coast Bluegrass Band had once played almost a decade earlier Nothin Fancy released their first project Bluegrass in a Plain Brown Wrapper shortly afterwards

Nothin Fancy and East Coast Bluegrass Band continued to coexist until 2000 when East Coast Bluegrass Bands members drifted apart and had to reorganize

 Notable Changes 
Chris Sexton who had appeared with Nothin Fancy for their firstplace victory in the band competition at the Maury River Fiddlers Convention in 1998 and recorded as a guest fiddler on the bands second and third releases Earn Your Ticket and Field of Dreams respectively officially became the newest member of Nothin Fancy in 2000  The fourth project Now and Then is the first album to feature the fivepiece group as it is today

Shorter departed from the group in 2005 and was replaced by Eli Johnston of Branson MO  Nothin Fancy released Album Nonbsp7 under Pinecastle with Johnston and featured him as the lead vocal on the song Tupelo County Jail but Johnston only stayed with the group for 13 months  Citing artistic differences he left the group and joined the band Pine Mountain Railroad  Nothin Fancys members called Shorter back into service in time for the 6th Annual Nothin Fancy Bluegrass Festival  Shorter who at the time was playing bass for country star Keith Bryant happily agreed and the band was reunited with its original cast and has stayed as such since

Gary Farris the guitar player also departed the group in July 2012 and was replaced by Justin Tomlinrefhttpbluegrasstodaycomjustintomlintonothinfancy Justin Tomlin to Nothin Fancy Bluegrass Todayref Tomlin left in March 2014 and Jesse Smathers joined the group in his placerefhttpbluegrasstodaycomjessesmatherstonothinfancy Jesse Smathers to Nothin Fancy Bluegrass Todayref In June 2015 Jesse Smathers departed the group and was replaced by guitar and dobro player Caleb Coxrefhttpbluegrasstodaycomjessesmatherstolonesomeriverband Jesse Smathers to Lonesome River Band Bluegrass Todayref A month later the band signed a recording contract with Mountain Fever Records and released their first project for the label By Any Other Name in August 2015refhttpbluegrasstodaycomnothinfancytomountainfever Nothin Fancy to Mountain Fever Bluegrass Todayref

Their sixth album Reflections was a much more personal album with Andes penning 10 of the 13 songs  It featured the novelty single I Met My Baby in the PortaJohn Line as a bonus track also by Andes  Reflections was not as commercially successful as Once Upon a Road but it was from these two albums and the performances from this period that Nothin Fancy had found its highly unique voice which paid homage to bands such as the The Country GentlemenCountry Gentlemen and the Seldom Scene  The late Charlie Waller American musicianCharlie Waller a founding member of the The Country GentlemenCountry Gentlemen who went on to lead that group until his death in 2004 met with Andes at the httpwwwspbgmacom Society for the Preservation of Bluegrass Music of America annual convention and learned the song Heaven Got an Angel from Andes that was recorded originally on Field of Dreams and recorded it on the The Country GentlemenCountry Gentlemen album Cryin in the Chapel

 Musical style and sound 
The band seeks to remain true to the traditional sounds of the great bluegrass bands of the 1940s and 50sref namesamhillbandscom while also performing and recording original songs by their prolific songwriter lead singer Mike Andes  Classic bluegrass material draws from Bill Monroe Ralph Stanley the The Country GentlemenCountry Gentlemen and the Seldom Scene but song selection ranges from original material to gospel classics to covers of pop artists such as Bob Seger Bruce Springsteen Bill Withers Bob Dylan and Creedence Clearwater Revival

In live performance Nothin Fancy has been noted for its strong vocals fourpart arrangements and its highenergy shows wellseasoned with humor  The quintets early years saw the band gathering around one microphone employing a shellgame choreography for solos and backup which keeps the show visually active as well as aurally pleasing although the most recent configuration is more traditional with individual microphones for instruments and vocals Andes clear singing style is attributed to the unique stylings of Charlie Waller American musicianCharlie Waller whose earthy bassbaritone voice sang with clear enunciation  Farris sings a bold tenor harmony remarkable for its projection his powerful delivery has been likened to the late John Duffey of the Seldom Scene  Shorter occasionally sings baritone harmonies an octave higher while Davis sings bass vocals more on gospel songs In later recordings Davis gave up singing bass and allowed Sexton to sing bass on gospel songs

Nothin Fancy Bluegrass Festival
In 2001 a Rockbridge County entrepreneur Morris OShields created a bluegrass festival at the Glen Maury Park the site of the Maury River Fiddlers Convention where Nothin Fancy won its victory three years before  The festival was named for Nothin Fancy who have served as the host act in years sincerefhttpwwwrockbridgeweeklycomrw_articlephpndx9737 Rockbridge Weekly Virginia Based Bluegrass Band Nothin Fancy Garners National Music Awardref  Just as the band originally named itself after the first music festival in which it competedsubsequently winning the prizeit then had a music festival whose competition it had also won subsequently named for it

The sonamed festival has become a muchloved annual event that brings scores of bluegrass fans to the Shenandoah Valley and to the little town of Buena Vista VA where Farris calls home and from which the band operates  Held each year at the Glen Maury Park in Buena Vista Virginia the music festivalfestival has perennially played host to major bluegrass musicbluegrass musical groupbands  The 2008 music festivalfestival for example included such names as Rhonda Vincent Michelle Nixon Blue Mountain Sunrise The Deer Creek Boys The Country GentlemenRandy Waller  the Country Gentlemen Blue Moon Rising and the httpwwwthegarywaldrepbandcom Gary Waldrep BandrefhttpwwwcybergrasscommodulesphpnameNewsfilearticlesid5313 Cybergrass SPBGMA Entertaining Group Of The Year Nothin Fancy To Host Bluegrass Fest September 10 2008ref  It has also hosted bands and artists such as IIIrd Tyme Out the httpwwwlonesomeriverbandcom Lonesome River Band Missy Raines Marty Raybon The Dillards the Lewis Family httpwwwgoldwingexpressnet Goldwing Express httpwwwlarrystephensonbandcom Larry Stephenson httpwwwmarknewtonbandcom Mark Newton Doyle Lawson and httpwwwcharliesizemorebandcom Charlie Sizemore

After high school he enrolled at Washington University in St Louis completed four years of a commercial arts program and dropped out to focus on music however he did receive a degree in 1960 He immersed himself in the local music scene working as a DJ playing in bands and occasionally recording singles for local labels

Music career

In 1965 he moved to Nashville Tennessee the center of the country music industry In 1966 he signed with RCA Victor and produced his first album Looks at Life in the same yearrefref

In 1967 Hartfords second album Earthwords  Music spawned his first major songwriting hit Gentle on My Mindref nameigftcomref His recording of the song was only a modest success but it caught the notice of Glen Campbell who recorded his own version which gave the song much wider publication At the 10th Annual Grammy Awards1968 Grammys the song netted four awards two of which went to Hartford It became one of the most widely recorded country songs of all time and the royalties it brought in allowed Hartford great financial independence Hartford later said that the song bought his freedomref namebiographyHartfords httpwwwjohnhartfordcombiographycfm biography  from his official siteref

As his popularity grew he moved to the West Coast where he became a regular on The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour other television appearances followed as did recording appearances with several major country artists Hartford played banjo and sang the vocal harmonies on the Guthrie Thomas song Ill be Lucky He also played with The Byrds on their album Sweetheart of the Rodeo

His success on the Smothers Brothers series was enough that Hartford was offered the lead role in a TV detective series but he turned it down to move back to Nashville and concentrate on music He also was a regular on The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hourref nameAMG  as the banjo picker who would stand up from his seat in the audience to begin the theme music and The Johnny Cash Show

Hartford is considered a cofounder of the newgrass movement although he remained deeply attached to traditional music as well His last band and last few albums reflect his love for prebluegrass oldtime music

Steamboating
The culture of the Mississippi River and its steamboats captivated Hartford from an early age He said that it would have been his lifes work but music got in the way so he intertwined them whenever possible In the 70s Hartford earned his steamboat pilots license which he used to keep close to the river he loved for many years he worked as a pilot on the riverboatsteamboat Julia Belle Swain during the summers He also worked as a towboat pilot on the Mississippi RiverMississippi Illinois RiverIllinois and Tennessee RiverTennessee Rivers

During his later years he came back to the river every summer Working as a pilot is a labor of love he said After a while it becomes a metaphor for a whole lot of things and I find for some mysterious reason that if I stay in touch with it things seem to work out all right His home in Madison Tennessee was situated on a bend of the Cumberland River and built to simulate the view from a steamboat deck He used to talk to the boat captains by radio as their barges crawled along the river That bend of the Cumberland River known as Hartfords Bend or John Hartford PointrefDansby Andrew June 5 2001 httpswwwrollingstonecommusicnewsjohnhartforddeadaftercancerbattle20010605 John Hartford Dead After Cancer Battle  Rolling Stoneref is denoted on official navigational charts with the John Hartford LightrefUS Army Corps of Engineers 2013 httpcdm16021contentdmoclcorgcdmrefcollectionp16021coll10id170 Cumberland River navigation charts Smithland Kentucky to Celina Tennessee Chart No 27ref

Works

AereoPlain and Morning Bugle are often considered to be Hartfords most influential works coming as they did at the beginning of a period in which artists such as Hartford and the New Grass Revival led by Sam Bush would create a new form of country music blending their country backgrounds with influences from a number of other sources His later years had a number of live albums as well as recordings that explored the repertoire of oldtime folk music He sketched the cover art for some of his midcareer albums drawing with both hands simultaneously

Development

Scruggs is noted for popularizing a threefinger banjopicking style now called Scruggs style that has become a defining characteristic of bluegrass musicref nametrishkaref Prior to Scruggs most banjo players used the clawhammerfrailing or clawhammer technique which consists of holding the fingers bent like a claw and moving the entire hand in a downward motion so that the strings are struck with the back of the middle fingernail This motion is followed by striking the thumb on a single stringref nameclawhammervideoref The threefinger style of playing is radically different from frailing the hand remains stationary and only the fingers and thumb move somewhat similar to classical guitar techniqueref namebrownpaul  Scruggs style also involves using Fingerpickpicks on three digits see photo each plucking individual stringsdownward with the thumb then upward with the index and middle finger in sequence When done skillfully and in rapid sequence the style allows any digit though usually the thumb to play a melody while the other two digits play arpeggios of the melody line The use of picks gives each note a louder percussive attack creating an exciting effect described by The New York Times as like thumbtacks plinking rhythmically on a tin roofref namenytimesref This departure from traditional playing elevated the banjo to become more of a solo instrumenta promotion from its former role of providing background rhythm or serving as a comedians propand popularized the instrument in several genres of musicref nameassociatedrefref nametelegraphrefref nameinstructionbookref

Earl Scruggs did not invent threefinger banjo playing in fact he said the threefinger style was the most common way to play the fivestring banjo in his hometown in western North Carolinaref namebrownpaul  An early influence was a local banjoist Snuffy JenkinsDeWitt Snuffy Jenkins who plucked in a finger style According to banjoist and historian Tony Trischka Jenkins came about as close as one could to Scruggs style without actually playing itref nametrishka  At age ten when Scruggs first learned the technique he recalled that he was at home in his room after a quarrel with his brother He was idly playing a song called Reuben and suddenly realized that he was playing with three fingers not two That excited me to no end he later recalled and said he ran through the house repeatedly yelling Ive got itref namebrownpaul ref namewebsitebio  From there he devoted all his free time to perfecting his timing and to adding syncopation and variations to it Controversy exists as to the actual origin of threefinger picking stylerefref Don Reno an eminent banjo player who also played this style and who knew Scruggs at that young age described Scruggs early playing as similar to that of Snuffy Jenkinsref namewillis  Scruggs however consistently referred to it as his own saying that he adapted to it a syncopated roll that was quite differentref namewillis ref namebaderbrianref On the subject John Hartford said Heres the way I feel about it Everybodys all worried about who invented the style and its obvious that three finger banjo pickers have been around a long timemaybe since 1840 But its my feeling that if it wasnt for Earl Scruggs you wouldnt be worried about who invented itref namewillis 

With Bill Monroe and the Blue Grass Boys
At age 15 Scruggs played in a group called The Morris Brothers for a few months but quit to work in a factory making sewing thread in the Lily Textile Mill near his home in North Carolinaref namecooperbookref He worked there about two years earning 40 cents an hour until the draft restriction for World War II was lifted in 1945 at which time he returned to music performing with Lost John Miller and his Allied Kentuckians on WNOX in Knoxvilleref namewillis  About this time an opening to play with Bill Monroe became available
