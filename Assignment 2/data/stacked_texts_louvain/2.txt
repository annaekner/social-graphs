Great Plains was a Progressive countryprogressive Country musiccountry Pop musicpop band that formed in 1987 The band comprised Jack Sundrud currently as of 2015 of Poco bandPoco Russ Pahl Denny DadmunBixby Michael Young and Lex Browning In their career they recorded two studio albums and had four singles enter the Billboard magazineBillboard country charts Their highest charting single Faster Gun peaked at Nonbsp41

Early days
The band began with Jack Sundrud Russ Pahl and Michael Young who were all working in Michael Johnson singerMichael Johnsons Bluer Than Blue backup band  Sundrud was a seasoned professional having toured with various acts such as Poco bandPoco Nicolette Larson and Allman Brothers guitarist Dickey Betts Brent Maher was producing Johnson and was looking for a new band to produce Maher liked the sound of Michael Johnsons backup band Sundrud was playing bass at the time so Maher asked Austin Cunningham to join the band in the studio to do some experimentation  The band recorded a few tracks mostly Cunninghams songs with himself on lead vocals  The band lineup  instrumentation at that time was Austin Cunningham on acoustic guitar and lead vocals Jack Sundrud on bass and vocals Russ Pahl on lead guitar steel guitar and vocals and Michael Young on drums  After recording a few sessions Cunningham decided that he wanted to pursue a solo career and left the band Sundrud then played some of his own songs for producer Maher and his daughter Dianna who ran Mahers publishing company Moraine Music They liked the songs and signed Sundrud to their publishing company as a songwriter Maher and the band then recorded more tracks of Sundruds material with Sundrud on lead vocals

The band showcased for RCA and they passed It was around this time that the band decided to hire a regular bassist and move Sundrud to acoustic guitar and lead vocals so in 1989 the band added Denny DadmunBixby to join the band on bass and vocals  Sundrud first met Bixby when the latter was recording with Wild Choir Gail Davies band Sundruds first road gig was with Davies in 1982 The recording of the first record was slow and piecemeal since the band all had other gigs and needed income  Pahl was working with Don Williams Bixby with Wild Choir and Gail Davies and Young was doing sessions and had a growing customcar business building cars The band recorded when they could until 1989 but in early 1990 Sundrud was asked to join country rock band Poco after Richie Furay had left the Legacy tour the Legacy tour and album initially featured all 5 original Poco members This was Sundruds second stint with Poco having been a member of the band from 198587 Sundruds first professional band the Minnesotabased Podipto a regional band signed to GRT Records had opened for Poco in 1971  Sundruds Poco gig put off the finishing of the Great Plains project for a year

Record deal
The band finished the recording in 1991 showcased for SonyColumbia and got a record deal  The début album was produced by Brent Maher and Don Potter musicianDon Potter assisted by Brian Maher  The first single A Picture of You written by Sundrud and songwriter Gary Burr peaked at Nonbsp48 Faster Gun was their highest chart entry at Nonbsp41

The first album failed to bring in large sales numbers and both Russ Pahl and Michael Young left the band in 1992  Sundrud and Bixby hung on using studio musicians to record most of a second album but during the recording process their record label Sony had a changing of executives and the band was dropped in 1993

Also in 1993 they were nominated by the Academy of Country Music for Top New Vocal Group or Duet along with Confederate Railroad and Little Texas bandLittle Texas but lost to Confederate Railroad

It was around this time that Brent Maher became involved with what would become Magnatone Records an independent label financed by Roy Speer who founded the Home Shopping Network Other artists included Shelby Lynne Billy Montana Rich McCready and Caryl Mack Parker

Another chance
Sundrud and Bixby decided to make Great Plains a band again and brought multiinstrumentalist  singer Lex Browning on board They scrapped what they had been working on during the second album and started over with Brent Maher and Don Potter producing again The result was 1996s Homeland  The label released 3 singles from that album all of which once again failed to move beyond the 40s in the charts including Dancin With The Wind written by Sundrud and longtime Nashville songwriter  performer Craig Bickhardt Healin Hands written by Sundrud and Chuck Cannon and Wolverton Mountain written by Claude King and Merle Kilgore Dancin With The Wind and Wolverton Mountain also had videos produced The band then recorded a couple of songs with Sundruds friend producer Michael Clute Diamond Rio Magnatone released a single Theres More Where That Came From written by Sundrud and Tia Sillers but they dropped the band the day after the single was released Great Plains played some priorcommitted dates for a few months and disbanded for good in 1996

After disbanding
Jack Sundrud rejoined Poco in 2000 and is still with the band as of 2015 once again playing bass and providing vocals  Sundrud cowrote the hit Cains Blood with Michael Johnson for the vocal group 4 Runner which peaked at Nonbsp26 on the country charts in 1995 He also cowrote with Craig Bickhardt the Nonbsp1 country hit It Must Be Love Ty Herndon songIt Must Be Love for Ty Herndon Sundrud recorded a solo album By My Own Hand in 2005 and a second album effort in collaboration with Craig Bickhardt called Idlewheel in 2006 which morphed into a full band with tour dates through 2008

Lex Browning returned to Portland Oregon where he had previously played with Jeffrey Fredericks band Les Clams He is a member of the Freak Mountain Ramblers with whom he has recorded four albums and in 2009 released his first solo album Good Rain on Red Newt Records  As of September 2018 Browning joined his exbandmate Sundrud in Poco where he plays guitar fiddle and vocals

DadmunBixby sang backing vocals on Suzy Bogguss 1998 album Nobody Love Nobody Gets Hurt  He toured with Suzy Bogguss and Rodney Crowell playing Bass and adding backing vocals before returning to Portland Oregon where he often performs with Lex Browning   He has also released two CDs of his own Fish Out Of Water in 2002 and JOYRIDE in 2017

While on the tour with Ronstadt Frey and Henley decided to form a band together and informed Ronstadt of their intention Frey later credited Ronstadt with suggesting Leadon for the band and arranging for Leadon to play for her so Frey and Henley could approach him about forming a band together They also pitched the idea to Meisner and brought him on boardrefref These four played live together behind Ronstadt only once for a July concert at Disneylandref nameEagles but all four appeared on her Linda Ronstadt albumselftitled albumrefref It was later proposed that JD Souther should join the band but Meisner objected The four were signed in September 1971 to Asylum Records the new label started by David Geffen who was introduced to Frey by Jackson Browne Geffen bought out Freys and Henleys contracts with Amos Records and sent the four to Aspen Colorado to develop as a bandrefref Having not settled on a band name yet they performed their first show in October 1971 under the name of Teen King and the Emergencies at a club called The Gallery in Aspenrefrefrefref

The idea of naming the band Eagles came during a peyote and tequilainfluenced group outing in the Mojave Desert However accounts of the origin of the name vary Don Felder who had yet to join the Eagles and was not at the desert credited Leadon with originating the name when he recalled reading about the Hopis reverence for the eagle while Souther suggested that the idea came when Frey shouted out Eagles when they saw eagles flying aboverefref Steve Martin a friend of the band from their early days at The Troubadour recounts in his autobiography that he suggested that they should be referred to as the Eagles but Frey insists that the groups name is simply Eagles Geffen and partner Elliot Roberts initially managed the band they were later replaced by Irving Azoff while the Eagles were recording their third album

For their next album On the Border Henley and Frey wanted the band to break away from the country rock style and move more towards hard rock The Eagles initially started with Glyn Johns as the producer for this album but he tended to emphasize the lush side of their doubleedged music After completing only two usable songs the band turned to Bill Szymczyk to produce the rest of the albumrefref Szymczyk wanted a harderedged guitarist for the song Good Day in Hell and the band remembered Bernie Leadons childhood friend Don Felder a guitarist who had jammed backstage with the band in 1972 when they opened for Yes bandYes in Boston Felder had been nicknamed Fingers at the jam by Frey a name that stuck due to his guitar proficiency In January 1974 Frey called Felder to add slide guitar to the song Good Day in Hell and the band was so impressed that they invited him to join the group as the fifth Eagle the next day He appeared on one other song on the album the uptempo breakup song Already Gone Eagles songAlready Gone on which he performed a guitar duet with Frey Already Gone was released as the first single from the album and it reached number 32 on the charts On the Border yielded a number 1 Billboard magazineBillboard single Best of My Love Eagles songBest of My Love which hit the top of the charts on March 1 1975 The song was the Eagles first of five charttoppers The album included a cover version of the Tom Waits song Ol 55 and the single James Dean songJames Dean which reached number 77 on the charts

Hillman was born in Los Angeles California the third of four childrenrefref He spent his early years at his familys ranch home in rural northern San Diego County CaliforniaSan Diego County approximately  from Los Angeles He has credited his older sister with exciting his interest in Country musiccountry and folk music when she returned from college during the late 1950s with folk music records by The New Lost City Ramblers and others Hillman soon began watching many of the countrymusic shows on local television in southern California at the time such as Town Hall Party The Spade Cooley Show and Cals Corral Hillmans mother encouraged his musical interests and bought him his first guitar shortly thereafter he developed an interest in Bluegrass musicbluegrass particularly the mandolin At the age of 15 Hillman went to Los Angeles to see the Kentucky Colonels bandKentucky Colonels bluegrass band at the Ash Grove music clubAsh Grove and later convinced his family to allow him to travel by train to Berkeley CaliforniaBerkeley for lessons from mandolinist Scott Hambly When Chris was 16 his father committed suiciderefref

Hillman became known in San Diegos folk music community as a solid player this won him an invitation to join his first band the Scottsville Squirrel Barkersref nameLarkinCountry The band lasted barely two years recording only one album Blue Grass Favorites which was distributed in supermarkets however it has a posthumous reputation as the spawning ground for a number of musicians who went on to play in the Eagles the Flying Burrito Brothers the Byrds Hearts  Flowers and the Country Gazette bandCountry Gazette When the band broke up in late 1963 Hillman received an invitation to join the Golden State Boys regarded as the top bluegrass band in southern California and featuring future country star Vern Gosdin his brother Rex and banjoist Don Parmley later of the Bluegrass Cardinals Shortly thereafter the band changed its name to The Hillmenref nameLarkinCountry soon Hillman was appearing regularly on television and using a fictitious ID Chris Hardin to allow the underage musician into the country bars where many of his gigs were played When the Hillmen folded he briefly joined a spinoff of Randy Sparks The New Christy MinstrelsNew Christy Minstrels known as the Green Grass Revival

 Career 

 The Byrds 19641968 


At this point a frustrated Hillman considered quitting music and enrolling at UCLA when he received an offer from The Hillmens former manager and producer Jim Dickson to join Jim later Roger McGuinn David Crosby Gene Clark and Michael Clarke in a new band The Byrdsref nameLarkinCountry Hillman was recruited to play bass guitar although he had never picked up the instrument Thanks to his bluegrass background he quickly developed his own melodic style on the instrument The Byrds first single a jangly cover of Bob Dylans Mr Tambourine Man was an international hit and marked the birth of folk rock During the mid1960s the Byrds ranked as one of the most successful and influential American pop groups they recorded a string of hits including Turn Turn Turn Eight Miles High and So You Want to Be a Rock n Roll Star

Hillman kept a low profile on the bands first two albums on which McGuinn and Clark shared lead vocals with Crosby adding high harmony and singing the bridge on All I Really Want to Do However Clarks departure in 1966 and Crosbys growing restlessness allowed Hillman the opportunity to develop as a singer and songwriter in the group He came into his own on the Byrds 1967 album Younger Than Yesterday cowriting and sharing lead vocals with McGuinn on the hit So You Want to Be a Rock n Roll Starref nameLarkinCountry Hillman also wrote and sang the minor hit Have You Seen Her Face Thoughts and Words Time Between and The Girl with No Name the latter two demonstrating his bluegrass and country roots Hillmans prominence continued with the Byrds next album The Notorious Byrd Brothers on which he shared songwriting credit on seven of the albums eleven songs

 Pioneering country rock 
Internal strife dogged the Byrds and by the beginning of 1968 the band was down to two original members Hillman and McGuinn with Hillmans cousin Kevin Kelley musicianKevin Kelley on drums They then hired Gram Parsons to replace Crosby Hillman who had brought country music into the Byrds earliest recording of Satisfied Mind found another lover of country music in Parsons  Sweetheart of the Rodeo was recorded in Nashville and Los Angeles and continues to inspire musicians in the Americana formatref nameLarkinCountry Parsons left the band shortly thereafter Hillman brought in former Kentucky Colonels guitarist Clarence White as a replacement and White suggested that the group replace Kelley with Gene Parsons no relation to Gram on drums but this lineup was shortlived and Hillman himself left the Byrds due to financial misappropriation by their management

History

Inception
During recording of Buffalo Springfields third and final album Last Time Around lead singers Stephen Stills Neil Young and Richie Furay each recorded songs without the other members present  One of Furays solo efforts was the countryinfluenced ballad Kind Woman which he recorded with the help of producerengineerbassist Jim Messina musicianJim Messina and pedal steel guitarist Rusty Young musicianRusty Youngref nameEderref

When Buffalo Springfield split up Furay Messina and Rusty Young decided to start their own group oriented toward such songs Its original lineup was Furay vocals and rhythm guitar Messina lead guitar vocals producer Rusty Young pedal steel guitar banjo dobro guitar mandolin and vocals George Grantham musicianGeorge Grantham drum kitdrums and vocals and Randy Meisner bass guitarbass and vocals The group was signed to a recording contract with Epic Records which acquired the rights to Furay from the Springfields Atlantic Records subsidiary Atco RecordsAtco label in return for those to Graham Nash of The Hollies who was moving to Atlantic as part of forming Crosby Stills  Nashref nameEder  Originally the new group was named Pogo after the Pogo comicsPogo comic strip character but was changed when its creator Walt Kelly objected and threatened to sue

Furay era 19691973
Their debut Pickin Up the Pieces Poco albumPickin Up the Pieces 1969 is considered a pioneering album of the country rock genrerefEder Bruce   Pickin Up the Pieces review Allmusicref The first edition of the Rolling Stone Record Guide edited by Dave Marsh and John Swenson gave the release 5 stars its highest rating as an essential album However the album performed weakly peaking at Nonbsp63 on Billboard magazineBillboard Billboard 200album chartref nameThe Great Rock Discography

The bands lineup proved to be a problem throughout its career During the recording of the debut album Meisner left the group as a result of a conflict with Furay reportedly Meisner had objected after Furay barred all but himself and Messina from the first albums final mix playback sessionsrefEliot Marc To the Limit The Untold Story of the Eagles Da Capo Press 2004 p37 ref After a stint playing with Ricky Nelsons Stone Canyon Band Meisner later became a founding member of the Eagles bandEagles Messina briefly took over on bass until Timothy B Schmit joined the band in September 1969ref nameThe Great Rock Discography

Their second studio album Poco albumPoco 1970 again resulted in low sales peaking at Nonbsp58 However the bands next album the live set Deliverin or DeLIVErin as it is sometimes represented picked up moderate airplay Furays Cmon hitting Nonbsp69 Deliverin became Pocos first album to reach the Top 40 on the Billboard 200Billboard 200 peaking at Nonbsp26

Messina chose to leave the band in October 1970 feeling Furay exerted too much control over the groups sound He also was anxious to get off the road and return to his career in studio production This would lead him ultimately on to Loggins  Messina At the recommendation of Peter Cetera of Chicago bandChicago Messina selected guitaristsinger Paul Cotton a onetime member of the Illinois Speed Press to replace himref nameThe Great Rock Discography

The realigned Poco now on its third lineup on just its fourth album hired Steve Cropper as record producerproducer and released From the Inside Poco albumFrom the Inside 1971 Again poor sales were the result as the release landed at Nonbsp52

The band and its management were dissatisfied with Croppers production and hired Canadian  Jack Richardson record producerJack Richardson whod had big success with The Guess Who and oversaw the next three albums beginning with A Good Feelin to Know 1972 The band built the LP around the title track a popular concert tune but the single failed to chart The album itself peaked at Nonbsp69 As a result Furay became increasingly discouraged with Pocos prospects especially since exbandmates Stills Young Meisner and Messina were so successful with their respective groups In an April 26 1973 Rolling Stone magazine interview with Cameron Crowe he vented that Poco was still a secondbilled act and had not increased its audience

The next album Crazy Eyes 1973 reached Nonbsp38 but Furay departed at its release and joined with JD Souther and Chris Hillman to create the SoutherHillmanFuray Band on Asylum Records  Poco decided not to replace Furay and continued as a quartetref nameThe Great Rock Discography

PostFuray era 19731977
After Furays departure the band released their last two albums with Epic Seven Poco albumSeven 1974 and Cantamos 1974 The albums charted at Nonbsp68 and Nonbsp76 respectively Poco left Epic after Cantamos and signed with ABCDunhill Records

Head Over Heels Poco albumHead Over Heels was their first ABC release featuring Schmits acoustic Keep On Tryin which became the groups most successful single to date charting at Nonbsp50 on the Billboard Hot 100Billboard Hot 100 Around the time of the release of Head Over Heels The Very Best of Poco 1975 albumThe Very Best of Poco was released as a compilation album that documented the groups years with Epic  Epics release fought with Head Over Heels for attention though neither charted very well hitting Nonbsp43 and Nonbsp90 respectivelyref nameThe Great Rock Discography

The groups next ABC album was Rose of Cimarron albumRose Of Cimarron which also failed to generate much enthusiasm and peaked at Nonbsp89 Another Epic release also came out in 1976 the live album Live Poco albumLive

Al Garth exLoggins and Messina who guested on Head Over Heels and Rose of Cimarron was added to the groups 1976 touring line up on sax and violin but was gone by the end of that year

In the summer of 1976 the group was on the bill with the StillsYoung Band teaming but was left high and dry when Neil Young pulled out of the tour which was then canceled

Indian Summer Poco albumIndian Summer was released the following spring peaking at Nonbsp57 while the title track reached Nonbsp50ref nameThe Great Rock Discography The appearance of Steely Dans Donald Fagen playing synthesizer on two of the albums tracks marked a move away from the country rock sound the band had primarily been known for

Success 19771980
In August 1977 Schmit quit to join the Eagles bandEagles coincidentally replacing former Poco member Meisner yet again  As a result a fully produced live album recorded at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium in Los Angeles in July 1977 was shelved by ABC  After languishing in storage for many years the album was eventually released by John Thaler and Futuredge Music in partnership with Universal Special Projects as The Last Roundup PocoThe Last Roundup in 2004

After Schmits departure Poco decided to take a break Grantham took some time off while Young and Cotton decided to continue as the CottonYoung Band and redoubled their efforts to succeed  They selected the Britons Steve Chapman Drum kitdrums and Charlie Harrison bass guitarbass backing vocals formerly of Judas Jump both of whom had played together with Leo Sayer and Al Stewart to round out their new quartet  However ABC decided to pick up the CottonYoung album   as long as they continued under the Poco name Thus although Grantham had never quit Poco he found himself bought out of the group after he was not happy with the changes in its business setup including the groups publishing no longer being divided evenly After a stint with McGuinn Clark  Hillman he subsequently landed a job as drummer for Ricky Skaggs

Legend PocoLegend 1978 the CottonYoung album with cover art by graphic artist and later comedy actor Phil Hartman subsequently became the groups most commercially successful LP containing two Top 20 hits Crazy Love Poco songCrazy Love written and sung by Rusty Young which also had a sevenweek run at Number 1 on the Hot Adult Contemporary TracksAdult Contemporary chart in early 1979 the biggest hit on the AC chart that year and Cottons Heart of the Night songHeart of the Night  The album was RIAA certificationcertified gold Pocos first album to achieve this distinction in original distribution

Kim Bullard keyboard instrumentkeyboards backing vocals joined the band in December 1978 just after Legend was released  While Crazy Love was riding up the charts in early 1979 ABC Records was sold to MCA Records  Poco was retained by MCA and the Legend album was reissued on the MCA label

With the momentum built up from Legends success Poco were invited by the Musicians United for Safe Energy MUSE collective to play during their concerts at Madison Square Garden in September 1979 And their new hit Heart of the Night appeared on the resulting live album No Nukes albumNo Nukes the concerts and album all being in support of nuclearfree energy Both the concerts and the album also featured several other big artists such as Bruce Springsteen and Jackson Browne

19801999

During the first half of the 1980s the group released five more albums Under the Gun Poco albumUnder the Gun 1980 Blue And Gray 1981 Cowboys  Englishmen 1982 on MCA and moving over to Atlantic Records Ghost Town PocoGhost Town 1982 and Inamorata PocoInamorata 1984 Poco failed to duplicate the success achieved by Legend with each album performing more poorly than its predecessorref nameThe Great Rock Discography

Poco also contributed the song Ill Leave it Up to You to Fast Times at Ridgemont Highs soundtrack in 1982

On Inamorata the band mostly played down their Country rock sound to adopt more of an 80s style with more keyboards and glossy synth sounds as well as electronic drums The album also featured guest spots by former members Timothy B Schmit Richie Furay and George Grantham

The group lost its recording contract with Atlantic due to the slow sales of Inamorata but continued to tour mostly in small clubs Bullard left to rejoin Crosby Stills  Nash in 1983 but still appeared on the sessions for Inamorata   and Harrison who had not played on Inamorata departed in mid1984 New members Jeff Steele bass and Rick Seratte keyboards backing vocals came in for Pocos 1984 tour dates but they departed along with drummer Chapman to be replaced in 1985 by future Great Plains Tennessee bandGreat Plains front man Jack Sundrud vocals bass guitar and the returning Grantham Granthams reunion with Poco was brief though In late 1985 Steve Wariner asked him to join his band Chapman came back to take over drums again During this period the band  relocated to Nashville and recorded some demos though no record deal resulted And after a few scattered live dates for the group in 1986 and 1987 Paul Cotton pursued a solo career and did not perform with Poco again until 1992 while Young played in Vince Gills band

After a lengthy recording hiatus at the urging of Richard Marx and his manager Allen Kovac who took on Poco the band reemerged on the RCA label with the successful Legacy PocoLegacy 1989 reuniting original members Young Furay Messina Grantham and Meisner twenty years after Pocos debut Though Timothy B Schmit and Paul Cotton were also approached to appear on the project Schmit declined and Cotton who was busy with his solo career was bought out of the group and it ended up being only the five originals The album produced a Top 20 hit Call It Love in the fall of 1989 and another Top 40 hit Nothing to Hide in early 1990 earning Poco its second gold album in its 19th releaseref nameThe Great Rock Discography

The group having added a keyboardist Dave Vanacore toured in early 1990 opening for Marx and appeared at Farm Aid IV on April 7 1990 at the Hoosier Dome in Indianapolis Indiana But Furay now a church minister in Colorado then had to bow out due to his commitments and Poco toured as a headliner in the summer of 1990 with Sundrud returning to take over rhythm guitar from Furay

Despite Legacys gold status and the two hit singles the band did not make much money on their 1990 tour one of the problems being their booking into military bases that turned out to be mostly empty as the troops were all deployed for the Desert Shield operation in the Persian Gulf RCA ended up dropping them from their roster and recordings for a proposed follow up to Legacy were abandoned

In 1991 Poco toured as an acoustic trio with Young Messina and Meisner drummer Gary Mallaber joined them for dates in Japan that July mostly to make up dates that were missed the previous year But by the end of 1991 Messina and Meisner had returned to their individual careers

After Messina and Meisner left Young formed a side project Four Wheel Drive with John Cowan from New Grass Revival Foster  LloydBill Lloyd from Foster  Lloyd and Patrick Simmons of Doobie Brothers They were signed to a recording deal with RCA RecordsRCA Nashville and completed an album which was never released Warner Bros Records then picked up the group in 1993 but when they were threatened with lawsuits from bands who had already copyrighted the name Four Wheel Drive they changed the bands name to The Sky Kings But their one and only album minus Simmons who left when the Doobies schedule got too busy completed in 1997 was not released until 2000 three years after the group disbanded

In the meantime Rusty Young was the sole owner of the Poco name by early 1992 and though they had not officially disbanded the band seemed to be quietly fading away Despite this Young once again teamed with Cotton brought in new members Richard Neville vocals bass and Tim Smith drums and toured through the end of the decade although on a very limited schedule Young and Cotton also occasionally appeared as Poco as an acoustic duo

On September 16 1995 Poco appeared at Deadwood Jam in Deadwood South Dakota where former Loggins  Messina drummer Merel Bregante filled in for Tim Smith

20002013
Poco again became more active as a touring unit after they signed with Nashville manager Rick Alter and brought back Grantham and Sundrud in June 2000 reuniting the groups 1985 lineup

Running Horse 2002 found the band in the studio for the first time in thirteen years The CD was released through the bands website Furay who had continued to make guest appearances at their shows over the years when they played in his adopted homestate of Colorado reunited with the band again for a soldout show in Nashville in May 2004 resulting in the CDDVD release Keeping the Legend Alive 2004

On July 29 of that same year during a show at Stearns Square in Springfield Massachusetts Grantham suffered a stroke during the performance For their gig the following night at Barnstable County MassachusettsBarnstable County Fair in East Falmouth MA Poco brought in local drummer Chuck Woodhams then called Youngs Nashville neighbor Muscle Shoals Sound Studio drummer George Lawrence who had earlier stood in for Tim Smith at some Poco concerts in June 1999 to sub on drums for Grantham for the rest of 2004 He became a permanent member in 2005 Granthams recovery was slow and expensive and the group created a donor fund on its official website Poconutorg to offset some of his considerable medical expenses

Poco continued to write and record while performing at festivals performing arts centers theaters and clubs  In 2005 they played a short tour in Europe but Cotton was hospitalized in Norway with health issues and missed the last two shows of the tour Guitarist and singer Bill Lloyd of duo Foster  Lloyd substituted for Cotton for several subsequent shows in the US

Cotton returned in 2006 stabilizing the lineup of Young Cotton Sundrud and drummer George Lawrence Cotton and Sundrud released solo albums and Young started writing an autobiographical history of the band Poco alumni continued to periodically reunite in concert with this lineup

Beginning in 2009 Grantham occasionally appeared with the band again but limited his contributions to vocals only  Richie Furay and Jim Messina returned for several 2008 Poco performances at the Wildwood Lodge in Steelville Missouri a tour of California in 2009 ending at the Stagecoach Festival in Indio where they were joined by Grantham and Timothy B Schmit and several dates opening for Loggins and Messina featuring Furay Messina and Grantham

Bareback at Big Sky 2005 and  The Wildwood Sessions 2006 captured live acoustic versions of songs both new and familiar from their 40plus year career   Live at Columbia Studios Hollywood 93071 2010 unearthed an unreleased 1971 live performance by Furay Young Schmit Grantham and the then recently recruited Cotton in front of a private audience of family and friends

In early 2010 Paul Cotton left Poco abruptly publicly citing a financial dispute with Young On his official website he announced he would not be appearing with Poco at the Wildwood concerts stating It was not all that shocking when Rusty told me on February 27 that he would not honor the contract that I had been requesting for over 15 years and that this was goodbye On March 12 2010 Young responded on Pocos official website It was a sad day when I read on Pauls website that he wasnt coming to Wildwood and I guess that means hes leaving the band Poco immediately reformed with Young Sundrud Lawrence and new keyboardist and multiinstrumentalistsinger Michael Webb of Nashville Tennessee

The bands new incarnation continued to tour and record In early 2012 a live video of a new song Neil Young was released on YouTube as a teaser for a new studio album All Fired Up Poco albumAll Fired Up that was recorded in Nashville and released in March 2013 Selling on iTunes the bands website and through a distributor in Europe Young Sundrud and Webb penned all the songs on the selfproduced album

In its 45th year Rusty Young was the only original member in the band and remained the leader and front man on stage  He has been the only member of Poco to have performed at every gig and played on every recording since the bands inception in 1968

Retirement
At the end of 2013 Rusty Young announced his retirement At the age of 68 he said he had spent 45 years on the road in the same band and needed a break A few shows were booked into 2014 including three farewell shows in Florida One of those shows was a performance in a recording studio in front of a live audience for a DVD documentary of the bands live show Young said there could be some oneoffs in the future after that but the band would not be actively touring as before Young was finishing his memoirs for a book to be published He and Sundrud wrote and recorded music for childrens story videos as the Session Cats Lawrence Sundrud and Webb continued to write record and play in their own projects and to do freelance work with other artists in Nashville where they live Young continued to do guest performances with former members of Poco and other country rock artists

Poco was inducted into the httpCMHOForg Colorado Music Hall of Fame CMHOF with the CMHOF induction ceremony which took place at the Paramount Theatre Denver Colorado on January 9 2015 and included a performance by the following lineup of band members Paul Cotton Richie Furay Timothy B Schmit and Rusty Youngrefref  Also inducted into the CMHOF along with Poco were Firefall The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band and Stephen Stills and Manassas bandManassas

In early 2020 Poco friend and fan Tom Hampton was brought in by Sundrud to replace Browning for tour dates but touring was suddenly halted in March due to the COVID19 pandemicrefref

Rusty Young died on April 14 2021 at his home in Davisville Missouri from a heart attack He was 75refref  His death marked the end for Poco

History
Initial career 19711976
Jim Messina musicianJim Messina formerly of Buffalo Springfield and Poco bandPoco was working as an independent record producer for Columbia Records in 1970 when he met Kenny Loggins a littleknown singersongwriter and guitarist who was signed to ABCDunhill as a staff songwriterref nameLarkinref

The two recorded a number of Loggins compositions in Messinas home living room When Columbia signed Loggins to a sixalbum contract with the assistance of Messina recording began in earnest for Loggins debut album with Messina as producer Messina originally intended to lend his name to the Loggins project only to help introduce the unknown Loggins to Messinas wellestablished Buffalo Springfield and Poco audiences However by the time the album was completed Messina had contributed so much to the album  in terms of songwriting arrangement instrumentation and vocals  that an accidental duo was born

Their debut album was released November 1971 as Kenny Loggins with Jim Messina Sittin In Loggins and Messina albumSittin In The albums first single release the Caribbeanflavored Vahevala or Vahevella or Vaheevella found top 3 success on Chicagos WCFL AMWCFL on May 18 1972refref Vahevala and Nobody But You both reached the Hot 100 Although at first the album went unnoticed by radio upon release it eventually gained traction by autumn 1972 particularly on college campuses where the pair toured heavily Loggins and Messinas harmonies meshed so well that what was begun as a oneoff album became an entity unto itself Audiences regarded the pair as a genuine duo rather than as a solo act with a wellknown producer Instead of just continuing to produce Loggins as a sole performer they decided to record as a duo Loggins and Messinaref nameLarkin

On March 3 1973 Loggins and Messina played Carnegie Hall Ian Dove in the New York Times called it a nearperfect rock n roll concertrefref

When our first album Sittin In Loggins and Messina albumSittin In came out we started receiving a lot of excitement about the music and good sales Messina recalled in 2005 We had a choice It was either I now go on and continue to produce him and we do the solo career or we stay together and let this work For me I did not desire to go back out on the road I had had enough of that and I wanted to produce records But Clive Davis then president of the record company intervened and said You know I think youd be making a mistake if you guys didnt take this opportunity Things like this only happen once in a lifetime It may merit you sleeping on it overnight and making a decision that will be in your best interest He was absolutely correct Kenny made the decision as well It delayed his solo career but it gave him an opportunity I think to have oneref nameThibodeaux 

Messina assembled The Kenny Loggins Band by summoning old friends bassist Larry Sims and drummer Merel Bregante formerly of The Sunshine Company multireedist Jon Clarke musicianJon Clarke and violinistmultireedist Al Garth Famed Grammywinning keyboardist songwriter and record producer Michael Omartian played keyboards on the Sittin In Loggins and Messina albumdebut Loggins and Messina albumsecond and Full Sail Loggins and Messina albumthird albums but did not join them on tour Los Angelesbased session percussionist Milt Holland played on all of the duos studio albums but like Omartian he did not tour with themrefref

Over the next four years from 1972 to 1976 they produced four more studio albums of original material plus one album of Cover versioncovers of other artists material So Fine Loggins and Messina albumSo Fine and two live albums They sold 16 million records and were the most successful duo of the early 1970s surpassed later in the decade only by Hall  Oatesref nameThibodeaux  They charted three top 20 singles from the second and third albums Your Mama Dont Dance No 4 Thinking of You Loggins and Messina songThinking of You No 18 and My Music songMy Music No 16 Their work was covered by other prominent artists including Lynn Anderson who recorded Listen to a Country Song songListen to a Country Song in 1972 and reached No 3 on the charts and Anne Murray who reached the US top ten with Dannys Song in early 1973 and the US top twenty with A Love Song Loggins and Messina songA Love Song in early 1974 The later studio albums Mother Lode albumMother Lode 1974 Native Sons Loggins and Messina albumNative Sons 1976 often found both Loggins and Messina more as two solo artists sharing the same record rather than as a genuine partnership As both Loggins and Messina noted in 2005 their collaboration eventually became more a competition

Never really a team of true equals because of the initial teacherapprentice nature of their music experience levels the pair had quietly amicably parted in 1976 Their final studio album of original material Native Sons Loggins and Messina albumNative Sons was released January 1976 Later that year the duo went on a final tour ref nameLarkin though prior to the start of the tour Loggins accidentally cut his hand with a craft knife while practicing his woodcarving hobby at home which required surgery thereby preventing him from playing guitar for most of that final tour The final two concert dates of Loggins  Messina  as a duo  were in Honolulu Hawaii at the Neil S Blaisdell Center on September 24 and 25 1976 upon which the duo then parted to embark on solo careers Messina found solo success elusive but Loggins went on to become one of the biggest hitmakers of the 1980s

A greatesthits album The Best of Friends albumThe Best of Friends was released in November 1976 two months after the duo had ended  In January 1977 a second live album from concerts in 1975 and 1976 Finale albumFinale was released more by record company decision than one intended by the artists

Reformation
The two reunited in 2005 to choose tracks for an expanded compilation album of singles and album cuts The Best Sittin In Again which proved successful enough for them to embark on tour together Their successful Sittin In Again tour was launched in mid2005 and playedout the remainder of the year They also released an album that year of the tour Every couple of years wed talk about it but I was having too much fun as a solo artist Loggins said that summer It was very rewarding for me and I wasnt ready to share the reins I still had a lot of stuff to do on my own to prove myself and to express myself in a way that wouldnt have fit in with Loggins and Messinaref nameThibodeaux 

The two were pleased enough to consider future Loggins and Messina projects and the two also toured in 2009 Like most relationships we were a moment in time Loggins said Its just really fun to be able to go back and celebrate that and just sort of really honor each other as grown men in a way we never really did back then We were young and competitive and didnt realize that it wasnt necessarily all about getting your way but you learn that if you grow upref nameThibodeaux

Career
Early years
Lynne appeared on The Nashville NetworkTNNs country music show Nashville Now in 1987 She soon landed a recording contract with Epic Records Her first recording for Epic was a duet with George Jones If I Could Bottle This Up which became a top50 hit in 1988  Epic teamed Lynne with producer Billy Sherrill for her 1989 debut album Sunrise Shelby Lynne albumSunrise The followup 1990s Tough All Over Shelby Lynne albumTough All Over took more of a mainstream country direction and 1991s Soft Talk found Lynne moving into slick country pop

Lynne placed several songs on the country charts during this period but none managed to break into the top 20 Critics generally regarded her as a promising talent and she won the Academy of Country Music Award for New Female Artist of the YearAcademy of Country Music Award for Top New Female Vocalist in 1991 beating the other two nominees Carlene Carter and Matraca Berg

However she was tiring of the lack of control she was afforded over her image and musical direction She split from Epic and signed with the smaller Morgan Creek ProductionsMorgan Creek label debuting with 1993s Temptation Shelby Lynne albumTemptation an exercise in Bob Willsstyle Western swing and big band jazz The label folded not long after and she moved on to Magnatone for 1995s Restless Shelby Lynne albumRestless which marked a return to contemporarystyle country Afterward Lynne disappeared from recording for several years  One notable project that she assisted on was Vince Gills 1996 High Lonesome Sound album where she provided background harmony vocals on the song You and You Alone songYou And You Alone
Vince Gill and Shelby Lynne performed the song at the 1997 CMA awards show

Breakthrough
In 1998 Lynne moved to Palm Springs Californiarefref For her next record she worked with producer and songwriter Bill Bottrell The result was the confessional and eclectic pop rock and bluesinfluenced album I Am Shelby Lynne That album came from the most vulnerable desperate place she recalled years later I think about it every dayref namedusty trailref Island Def Jam released the album in the UK during the fall of 1999 and then in the US the following year to wide critical acclaimrefref At the 43rd Grammy Awards held on February 21 2001 she won the award for Grammy Award for Best New ArtistBest New Artist Thirteen years and six albums to get here said Lynne during her acceptance speechrefref One of the songs Dreamsome also appeared on the soundtrack of the film Bridget Joness Diary filmBridget Joness Diary

Musical legacy
NewtonJohns first boyfriend Ian Turpie once said of her early appearances In those days she had a small voice but it was very pure She could sing prettily in tuneThe improvement in her singing since she went to England has been remarkable She told me Shirley Bassey has been a big influence on her After hearing Bassey she worked at developing her head voice to sound like a chest voice the way Bassey uses hers The power shes developed is amazingref nameMurphy 

Michael Dwyer of the Sydney Morning Herald maintains that following NewtonJohns career was like watching our slightly older and braver sister growing up in public and her passing feels today like a lost member of the familyrefref Rachel Syme of The New Yorker also suggests that her familial downtoearth demeanor and humanity may have even superseded her singing accomplishments Her most lasting legacy might be as the rare celebrity who was almost universally well liked and thought of as an essentially kind and warmhearted personrefrefrefref

Long before and after the career summit of Grease NewtonJohn proved herself to be a fairly versatile performer lending her instrument to everything from sentimental ballads and New Age soul searching to lively dance productions and rock  soul fervor Maura Johnston of Vulture assesses NewtonJohn was a regular charttopperthroughout the 70s her lithe soprano adapting well to the soft pop sound of the era with AM Gold staples and tracks from the folk and country worldAs it turned out NewtonJohns voice was pretty well suited to the spiky dance pop that would become popular in the early 1980s tooref name2ref However Stephen Thomas Erlewine of the Los Angeles Times offers a counterpoint on her career decline in the mid1980s Hardness never was NewtonJohns comfort zone though and the 1980s were a much harder decade than the 1970s The inherent warmth of 1970s studio sessions gave way to the cold synthesized gleam of the 1980s a sterile sound that suited her well only once the candied fauxnew wave of Twist of Fate produced by David Fosterrefref Johnston further maintains Her pop heyday transcended any attempts to musically pigeonhole her and by the time she stopped having many new hits her musical legacy  had been pretty well solidifiedref name2

The Monkees



From 1965 to early 1970 Nesmith  along with Micky Dolenz Peter Tork and Davy Jones musicianDavy Jones  was a member of the television poprock band the Monkees created for the television The Monkees TV seriessituation comedy of the same name Nesmith won his role largely by appearing nonchalant when he auditionedref name0 He rode his motorcycle to the audition and wore a knit capwool hat to keep his hair out of his eyes producers Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider remembered the wool hat guy and called Nesmith back

Once he was cast Screen Gems bought his songs so they could be used in the show Many of the songs Nesmith wrote for the Monkees such as The Girl I Knew Somewhere Mary Mary songMary Maryref name0 and Listen to the Band songListen to the Band became minor hits One song he wrote You Just May Be the One is in mixed meter interspersing 54 bars into an otherwise 44 structure
 in 1967

Even before Colgems and Don Kirshners surreptitious release of the Monkees 2nd LP without the knowledge or consent of the four musicianactors they came to be frustrated by their studiomanufactured bubblegum image Within weeks of the release of More of the Monkees Nesmith lobbied successfully with the groups creators Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider that the Monkees be allowed to play their instruments on future records 
During a group meeting with Kirshner and Colgems lawyer Herb Moelis in a suite at the Beverly Hills Hotel each actor received a 250k royalties check yet Nesmith still threatened to quit Moelis rebuked him Youd better read your contract Nesmith defiantly punched a hole in the wall declaring to Moelis That could have been your face motherfucker Weeks later due to a breach of verbal agreement over the next single release which was promised to Nesmith by Rafelson  Schneider Nesmith led the charge in completely ousting musical supervisor Don Kirshner effectively giving the four youths complete artistic and production control of their output and the group finally worked as a true 4man rock group on 1967s Headquarters the Monkees albumHeadquarters despite Jones  Dolenz having very limited instrumental skills studio time being pricey and retakes costlyref nameSandoval Andrew 2001

During the bands first independent press conference Nesmith called their 2nd LP More of the Monkees probably the worst record in the history of the world partly due to rushed shoddy studio engineering The band took a hit to its artistic credibility when fans learned the four had not played all the instruments on the first 2 LPs But still sales continued to be profitable Headquarters sold 2 million copies down 2 million units from its predecessor but still reached the number 1 spot on Billboard falling only to Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band a week later and remaining 2 all through the entire 1967 Summer of Loveref nameSandoval Andrew 2001

For the remaining five Monkees LPs ironically the original Kirshner formula of hired studio musicians  songwriters again became the norm although Nesmith Tork Dolenz and Jones contributed about 50 of the original compositions Nesmith the majority of thoseref nameSandoval Andrew 2001
By the end of the Monkees run Nesmith was withholding many of his original song ideas from Monkees albums planning to release them in his postMonkees solo career 
Nesmiths last contractual Monkees commitment was a commercial for KoolAid and Nerf balls in April 1970 fittingly the spot ends with Nesmith frowning and saying Enerfs enerf As the bands sales declined Nesmith asked to be released from his contract despite it costing him I had three years left  at 150000 equivalent to 116 million in 2022 a year He remained in a financial bind until 1980 when he received his inheritance from his mothers estate In a 1980 interview with Playboy he said of that time I had to start telling little tales to the tax man while they were putting tags on the furniture

Beginnings

In 1982 Matt Davenport and Danny Gregg founded a band at Opryland USA a former country musicbased amusement park in Nashville Tennessee The band was first named the Grizzly River Boys after a new river rafting ride at the park but quickly changed names to the Tennessee River Boys due to its members disliking the original name Originally intended to promote the park through a onetime television special the band proved popular enough that it became one of many regular performers there Davenport Gregg and Ty Herndon alternated as lead vocalists with Davenport also playing bass guitar and Gregg on rhythm guitar completing the lineup were Larry Beard lead guitar fiddle banjo Mel Deal steel guitar Al DeLeonibus piano and Ed Mummert drumsrefref The group swapped lead voices told jokes and balanced oldschool country concert shtick with a contemporary sound Herndon left the group in 1983 to compete on the talent show Star Search and became a solo artist for Epic Records between 1995 and the early 2000sref titleTy Herndon biography lastErlewine firstStephen Thomas authorlinkStephen Thomas Erlewine publisherAllMusicref Herndon was temporarily replaced by Anthony Crawford musicianAnthony Crawford and then Virgil True before his role was taken over by Marty Roe who had originally toured nationally with the Christian band Windsongref namenew and worked in the park by doing impersonations of Larry Gatlin Following Herndons departure DeLonibus and Mummert quit as well with Dan Truman who had previously played in Brigham Young Universitys Young Ambassadorsref namestambler and Jimmy J J Whiteside taking their places Beard quit shortly afterward and ultimately became a session musician and former Mel McDaniel sideman Jimmy Olander took his place The band through the assistance of Bill Anderson singerBill Andersons drummer Len Snuffy Miller submitted demo musicdemos to various Nashville record labels with no success

By 1985 the Tennessee River Boys had quit working at Opryland According to Roe while the band enjoyed playing at the park they also felt that their status as a theme park attraction discredited them as real musicians to those in the Nashville community For the next few years they played at small venues such as high school auditoriums and usually worked no more than four concerts a month They also competed on Star Search but were eliminated in the first round Frustrated by the sporadic touring schedules Whiteside quit the group and was replaced by Brian Prout who previously performed in Hot Walker Band and Heartbreak Mountainref namenewref namestambler Around 1986 Deal and Gregg both left the group the latter due to health complications from a serious illness he had developed as a teenager They initially chose to operate as a quintet with Davenport as the sole lead vocalist and Roe and Prout singing harmony when this arrangement proved unsuccessful they found mandolinist Gene Johnson a former member of the bluegrass group Eddie Adcocks IInd Generation which Olander was a fan of as a child Johnson debuted at a concert in Clewiston Florida in May 1987 Also at this point the band members supplemented their incomes with outside jobs Johnson continued to work in carpentry Olander and Roe mowed lawns and Prout drove tour buses

In 1988 the band caught the attention of Keith Stegall a singersongwriter who would later become known primarily for his work as Alan Jacksons record producer Stegall produced demos for the Tennessee River Boys but noted that Davenport could not record the lead vocal and bass parts at the same time as they would be difficult to separate in the control room As a result Stegall had Roe sing a scratch vocal track live with the other musicians which would then be replaced by Davenports voice in postproduction Upon hearing Roe sing the scratch track Stegall successfully convinced the other members that Roe should be the lead vocalist instead Due to his discomfort outside the lead role and his wifes dissatisfaction with his career Davenport quit in late 1988 becoming the last founding member to leave The group quickly had to find a replacement as they were scheduled to appear on the talk show Nashville Now on January 23 1989 Alan LeBeouf who had just left Baillie  the Boys expressed interest in replacing Davenport but ultimately declined due to other commitments They finally chose Dana Williams a nephew of the bluegrass group Osborne Brothers and former sideman for Jimmy C Newman who had been a fan of the Tennessee River Boys since Herndon was a member

1990 Signing with Arista Nashville
Williams officially joined before the Nashville Now appearance but the band still did not have a record deal at this point They continued to record demos in Prouts garage with assistance from Monty Powell who had previously hired Roe and Olander for recording jingles but wanted to produce commercial music Powell was a friend of audio engineer Mike Clute who would later become one of the bands producers and songwriters Tim DuBois and Van Stephenson DuBois was talking with record executive Clive Davis about creating a country music branch of Arista Records called Arista Nashville Stephenson would later sign to the label in 1993 as a member of Blackhawk bandBlackhawk Initially DuBois was hesitant about signing the Tennessee River Boys as he felt that there were too many popular bands in country music and he was about to sign both Asleep at the Wheel and Exile American bandExile He expressed interest in signing Roe as a solo artist but at Powells insistence he agreed to see the band open for George Jones at a May 1989 concert and officially signed them to Arista Nashville in 1990ref nameallmusic titleDiamond Rio biography accessdateSeptember 10 2007 lastHuey firstSteve publisherAllMusicref The band members also decided to choose a new name as they thought that Tennessee River Boys sounded more suitable for a bluegrass or gospel group than a country onerefref Among the names they had chosen were Kilroy and TTown Mavericks the latter of which was rejected by Arista executives Prout suggested Diamond Rio after the truck manufacturing company Diamond Reo Trucksrefref The name had been previously rejected by another country band Shenandoah bandShenandoah whose lead singer Marty Raybon also a former member of Heartbreak Mountain gave Prout permission to use the name even though Shenandoah conducted business under that name

Shortly after the band received its record deal the band underwent a series of misfortunes when Olander Johnson and Williams came down with health problems On August 9 1990 Johnson was injured in a carpentry accident in Arkansas a day before his 41st birthday severely cutting his left thumb Robert Bolin substituted for Johnson during the bands tour in Brazil with Kevin Welch and Jann Browne On September 6 four weeks after Johnsons accident Williams was water skiing with his family in Cookeville Tennessee as his boat came forward at high speed when his wife was picking him up The propeller slashed Williams legs and he was rushed to a hospital for his injuries Brian Helgos and Paul Gregg Danny Greggs brother and a member of Restless Heart substituted for Williams Meanwhile Olander discovered that he had a lemonsized tumor that was pressing against his esophagus The tumor was never successfully diagnosed although it ultimately vanished

Musical career

Starting in 2001 the other members had noticed that Roe was having difficulty maintaining proper pitch musicpitch in concert Although they did not want to confront him about it for fear of bruising his ego they eventually convinced Roe of his problems by listening to concert recordings together Roe also consulted unsuccessfully with vocal coaches and throat doctors at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center The band attempted to cover up Roes problems by removing certain songs from concert set lists lowering the key musickey on others having Truman sometimes take the lead vocal and using pitch correction software but even these did not fully correct the issues Finally they consulted vocal coach Diane Sheets a friend of Johnsons soninlaw She determined that Roe was overcompensating for a small degree of hearing loss typical of musicians who have performed live for long periods of time thus tightening muscles in his throat and diaphragm and causing him to lose pitch Although Roe was initially cynical toward Sheetss coaching she was ultimately successful in restoring his voice

20022007 Completely Cant You Tell and Greatest Hits II
In 2002 Diamond Rio released its seventh studio album Completely Diamond Rio albumCompletely The band originally conceived it as a double album featuring traditional country on one disc and more poporiented country on the other but according to Prout this concept did not fully materialize because country music has blinders on as far as whats acceptable  and what isnt although Olander and Williams noted that the idea allowed them more leeway in choosing songsref namestretchref In addition to earning a gold certification it produced two consecutive Nonbsp1 singles in Beautiful Mess Diamond Rio songBeautiful Mess and I Believe Diamond Rio songI Believeref nameallmusic the latter being the bands last single to top Hot Country Songs Third single Wrinkles songWrinkles made Top 20 while the last single We All Fall Down also written by Steven Dale Jones failed to reach top 40 Two of the albums tracks were previously recorded by other artists Make Sure Youve Got It All written by Bill Anderson singerBill Anderson and Steve Wariner was originally recorded on Collin Rayes 1998 album The Walls Came Downrefref and If Youd Like Some Lovin by its cowriter David Ball country singerDavid Ball on his 1996 album Starlite Loungerefref

Rick Cohoon of Allmusic praised the album for its musical variety saying With artists as well anchored in the business as Diamond Rio the musical quality is a given The real challenge is outdoing yourself and coming up with fresh concepts The selections on this album seem to be the fruition of that search for musical renewal He cited Beautiful Mess and I Believe as standout tracksref namecohoonref Ray Waddell of Billboard magazineBillboard also thought that the singles were among the best tracks on the album while highlighting the instrumental track Rural Philharmonic which Olander had originally intended to record for a solo albumref namestretch as an example of the bands strong musicianshiprefref Chrissie Dickinson of the Chicago Tribune was less favorable commending the masterful musicianship and Roes light vocal timbre while criticizing the song selections as mostly a paintbynumbers trip around the musical block from the predictable power balladry of I Believe to the saccharine sentiments of We All Fall Downrefref

A seventh album tentatively titled Cant You Tell was recorded in 2003 but it was cancelled after its first two singles  the title track and One Believer  both failed to make Top 40 upon their releases in late 2004 and early 2005 respectively Diamond Rios second Greatest Hits package Greatest Hits II Diamond Rio albumGreatest Hits II was released in 2006 Like their first Greatest Hits album this compilation included several new songs as well as the bands greatest hits one of these new songs God Only Cries was released as a single peaking at Nonbsp30 Shortly after the albums release Diamond Rio parted ways with Arista Nashville

Musical stylings
In the country music industry particularly record producers hire mostly session musicians to record instrumental tracks for an album for both solo artists and bands as opposed to rock musicrock bands who record their own instrumental and vocal tracks on their albums Diamond Rio has been one of few selfcontained country bands to have followed the practice of each member playing their own instruments and singing their own vocals on all their albums themselves without any additional input from outside musicians The sole exception has been the inclusion of string sections on some of their later work starting with I Know How the River Feelsref namecanoeref and continuing through certain tracks on One More Day and Completelyref namecwref According to Prout other labels had rejected the band prior to their signing with Arista Nashville due to the band members insistence that they play all their own instrumentsref namemicah

Their early music blended neotraditionalist country with occasional traces of country rock primarily in the songs prominent rhythm sectionsref nameallmusicref nameoldies A bluegrass musicbluegrass influence has also been shown primarily in the threepart harmonies among Roe lead Williams baritone and Johnson tenorref namemicah Bluegrass influences are also shown in the bands prominent use of the mandolin as well as in the instrumentals featured on many of their earlier albumsref nameallmusicref nameoldiesref The bands later material has tended towards poporiented ballads such as I Believe and One More Day  songs which received critical acclaim for their often religiousthemed messages but were considered departures from the more traditional material of their first four albumsref namecw

Another trademark of Diamond Rios sound is the custombuilt BBender guitar played by Olanderrefref He refers to this instrument as the Taxicaster because of its yellow body and blackandwhite checkered pickguard which give it the coloration of a taxicabref namenew

1993 Dos Mundos
At the insistence of Sony Music NashvilleColumbia Nashville his first album Dos Mundos was an almost entirely Spanish country album Trevino who is not a native Spanish speaker and needed lessons before he could record the album was displeased with the decision I didnt like that a bit because I didnt want people to think I was a Tejano musicTejano artistEverybody thinks Im a Tejano singer crossing over to the country formatref nameremz The album was certified gold selling over 500000 copiesref nameamg

1998 Departure from Sony
Trevino asked to leave his contract with Sony in the hopes of moving in a different musical direction Sony refused to release him from the contract and Trevino cut a new album and released the single Only Lonely Me on August 18 1998 Before the album could be released Sony agreed to release Trevino and the album was shelvedrefref The same year Trevino appeared on compilation CD Tribute To Tradition released on Columbia label with a cover version of City Lights 1 country classic recorded by Ray Price musicianRay Price in 1958

20022004 In My Dreams
For his next album In My Dreams Trevino wanted to do a country record that had a Latin flavor to itref nameremz He wrote or cowrote every song on the album except for the final track a cover of the Bryan Adams song Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman The title track In My Dreams became a single and remained on the charts for twenty weeks falling just shy of the Top 40 on the Billboard country charts Trevino was disappointed with the final ranking but said the album opened a lot of doors for me It made people take me a little more seriously than Bobbie Ann Masonref nameremz

Musical style

Capitol changed the name of the band to The Bob Seger System In the transition between labels guitarist Carl Lagassa left the band and keyboard player Bob Schultz joined The Systems first single with Capitol was the antiwar message song 2  2   which reflected a marked change in Segers political attitudes from The Ballad of the Yellow Beret The single was again a hit in Detroit and hit number 1 on radio stations in Buffalo New York and Orlando Floridarefref but went unnoticed almost everywhere else and failed to chart nationally in the US The single did however make the Canadian national charts peaking at

Bernard Matthew Leadon III pronounced LEHdun born July 19 1947refref is an American singer musician songwriter and founding member of the Eagles bandEagles for which he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998 Prior to the Eagles he was a member of three country rock bands Hearts  Flowers Dillard  Clark and the Flying Burrito Brothers He is a multiinstrumentalist guitar banjo mandolin steel guitar dobro coming from a Bluegrass musicbluegrass background He introduced elements of this music to a mainstream audience during his tenure with the Eagles

Leadons music career since leaving the Eagles has been lowkey resulting in two solo albums the first actually being a collaborative project with Michael Georgiades with a gap of 27 years in between Leadon has also appeared on many other artists records as a session musician

Early life and musical beginnings

In San Diego California Leadon met fellow musicians Ed Douglas and Larry Murray of the local bluegrass outfit the Scottsville Squirrel Barkers The Barkers proved a breeding ground for future California country rock talent including shy 18yearold mandolin player Chris Hillman with whom Leadon maintained a lifelong friendship Augmented by banjo player and future Flying Burrito Brother Kenny Wertz the Squirrel Barkers eventually asked Leadon to join the group upon Wertzs joining the United States Air ForceAir Force in 1963

He later met  future Eagles lead guitarist Don Felder whose band the Continentals had just lost guitarist Stephen Stills 

A call from exSquirrel Barker Larry Murray in 1967 to join his fledgling psychedelic countryfolk group Hearts  Flowers brought Leadon to California where he became involved with the burgeoning LA folkcountry rock scene Leadon recorded one album with the band its second release Of Horses Kids and Forgotten Women for Capitol Records The record was a local hit but failed to make much of a dent on the national album charts Discouraged the group disbanded the following year

Dillard  Clark
By late 1968 Leadon had befriended bluegrassbanjo legend Doug Dillard late of the Dillards While staying with Dillard informal jam sessions with songwriter and exByrds member Gene Clark began to take shape and morphed into what eventually became the countryrock band Dillard  Clark In 1968 the group recorded The Fantastic Expedition of Dillard  Clark featuring Leadons backing vocals and multiinstrumental work The album included several compositions cowritten with Clark most notably the future Eagles staple and somewhat of a signature song for Leadon from their debut album Train Leaves Here This Morning

The Flying Burrito Brothers
 Rick Roberts musicianRick Roberts Chris Hillman Michael Clarke musicianMichael Clarke Bernie Leadon
Leadon left Dillard  Clark in 1969 eventually reconnecting with exSquirrel Barker and exByrd Chris Hillman who asked him to join the Flying Burrito Brothers a fledgling countryrock band that Hillman had formed a year earlier with fellow exByrd Gram Parsons Leadon recorded two albums with the group Burrito Deluxe and the postParsons LP The Flying Burrito Bros albumThe Flying Burrito Bros After the latter albums release in 1971 Leadon had tired of the bands lack of commercial success and decided to leave the band to pursue an opportunity to play with three musicians he had worked with while moonlighting in Linda Ronstadts backing band that summer forming the Eagles

Eagles

Leadon was the last original member to join the Eagles a band initially formed by guitaristsinger Glenn Frey drummersinger Don Henley and former Poco bandPoco bassistsinger Randy Meisner Leadon is often credited with helping shape the bands early countryrock sound bringing his strong sense of harmony as well as his country bluegrass and acoustic sensibilities to the group Instruments he played during his tenure in the band were electric guitar BBender acoustic guitar banjo mandolin dobro and pedal steel guitar

Upon the release of their debut album Eagles albumEagles the group met with near instant success due largely to the strength of their hit singles Take It Easy Peaceful Easy Feeling and Witchy Woman cowritten by Leadon and Henley all of which highlighted Leadons multiinstrumental talent and harmony vocals Their followup Desperado Eagles albumDesperado was another strong countryrock venture highlighted by the classics Tequila Sunrise Eagles songTequila Sunrise and the Desperado Eagles songtitle track Leadon had a prominent role on the album but it was met by surprisingly lukewarm reviews and lackluster sales As a result the band attempted to distance itself from the country rock label for their third album On the Border In doing so Leadon encouraged the group to recruit his old friend guitarist Don Felder to the band The result was the guitarheavy top 40 hit Already Gone Eagles songAlready Gone The album also included My Man Leadons touching tribute to his old bandmate and friend Gram Parsons who had died of a drug overdose the year prior at Joshua Tree National ParkJoshua Tree National Monument in southeastern California

With the wild success of On the Border and its followup smash One of These Nights tension within the band grew with some sources saying Leadon grew increasingly frustrated by the bands direction away from his beloved country and bluegrass toward albumoriented stadium rock He famously quit the band in 1975 by pouring a beer over Glenn Freys headrefEliot Marc 2005 httpsbooksgooglecombooksido_EjE6iyQoC To the Limit The Untold Story of the Eagles p 131 Da Capo Pressref He later cited a need to get healthy and break the vicious cycle of touring recording and heavy drug use that was rampant within the band

Upon Leadons departure Asylum Records released Their Greatest Hits 19711975 which highlighted the bands Leadon years and went on to become the bestselling album in United States history with sales in excess of 38 million units He was replaced by former James Gang guitarist and singer Joe Walsh

Although it has long been believed that he left because he was dissatisfied with the band moving into rock and roll Leadon denies it and said in 2013 Thats an oversimplification it implies that I had no interest in rock or blues or anything but country rock Thats just not the case I didnt just play Fender Telecaster I played a Gibson Les Paul and I enjoyed rock  roll Thats evident from the early albumsrefref

Later career

Upon leaving the Eagles Leadon retreated from the limelight only to resurface in 1977 with musician friend Michael Georgiades for the album Natural Progressions credited to The Bernie LeadonMichael Georgiades Band featuring Leadon and Georgiades on guitars and alternating lead vocals along with Bryan Garofalo on bass Dave Kemper on drums and Steve Goldstein on keyboard

In 1985 he recorded an album of bluegrass and gospel favorites under the name Ever Call Ready featuring Chris Hillman and Al Perkins He also had a short stint with the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band in the late 1980s

In 1993 he became a member of Run CW a novelty group singing Motown hits bluegrass style recording two albums for MCA Records

In 1998 Leadon reunited with the Eagles in New York City for the bands induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame All seven current and former Eagles members performed together on Take It Easy and Hotel California

In 2004 he released his second solo effort in 27 years and his first under solely his name Mirror

The postaccident investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board NTSB showed that the leading cause of the accident was Denvers inability to switch fuel tanks during flight The quantity of fuel had been depleted during the planes flight to Monterey and in several brief practice takeoffs and landings Denver performed at the airport immediately before the final flight His newly purchased amateurbuilt Rutan aircraft had an unusual fuel tank selector valve handle configuration The handle had originally been intended by the planes designer to be between the pilots legs The builder instead put it behind the pilots left shoulder The fuel gauge was also placed behind the pilots seat and was not visible to the person at the controlsref nameAVW ref nameNTSB  An NTSB interview with the aircraft mechanic servicing Denvers plane revealed that he and Denver had discussed the inaccessibility of the cockpit fuel selector valve handle and its resistance to being turnedref nameAVW ref nameNTSB 

Before the flight Denver and the mechanic had attempted to extend the reach of the handle using a pair of Locking pliersViseGrip pliers but this did not solve the problem and the pilot still could not reach the handle while strapped into his seat NTSB officials postaccident investigation showed that because of the fuel selector valves positioning switching fuel tanks required the pilot to turn his body 90 degrees to reach the valve This created a natural tendency to extend ones right foot against the right rudder pedal to support oneself while turning in the seat which caused the aircraft to Aircraft principal axesyaw nose right and pitch upref nameAVW ref nameNTSB 

The mechanic said that he told Denver that the fuel sight gauges were visible only to the rear cockpit occupant Denver had asked how much fuel was shown He told Denver that there was less than half in the right tank and less than a quarter in the left tank He then provided Denver with an inspection mirror so he could look over his shoulder at the fuel gauges The mirror was later recovered from the wreckage Denver said that he would use the autopilot in flight to hold the airplane level while he turned the fuel selector valve He turned down an offer to refuel the aircraft saying that he would only be flying for about an hourref nameAVW ref nameNTSB 

The NTSB interviewed 20 witnesses about Denvers last flight Six of them had seen the plane crash into the bay near Point Pinosref nameAVW ref nameNTSB  Four said the aircraft was originally heading west Five said that they saw the plane in a steep bank with four saying that the bank was to the right north Twelve described seeing the aircraft in a steep nosedown descent Witnesses estimated the planes altitude between  when heading toward the shoreline Eight said they heard a pop or backfire accompanied by a reduction in the engine noise level just before the plane crashed into the sea

In addition to Denvers failing to refuel and his subsequent loss of control while attempting to switch fuel tanks the NTSB determined other key factors that led to the accident Foremost among these was his inadequate transition training on this type of aircraft and the builders decision to put the fuel selector handle in a hardtoreach placeref nameAVW ref nameNTSB  The board issued recommendations on the requirement and enforcement of mandatory training standards for pilots operating homebuilt aircraft It also emphasized the importance of mandatory ease of access to all controls including fuel selectors and fuel gauges in all aircraft

History
The groups members were originally part of country pop singer Don King musicianDon Kings road bandref nameLarkin When King stopped touring in 1981 the group decided to stay together The band played up to five sets a night six days a week for a time at Knights Corral on Nolensville Rd in Nashville as Bobby Mark and Sandgap until they auditioned for the TV show Star Search in 1983 They won the grand prize of 100000 and a recording contractref nameallmusicref

The band originally chose the name Savanna When another band with a similar name emerged the group decided to change its own monikerref nameLarkin They met at their managers office in Nashville TennesseeNashville and began looking through area telephone books for inspiration They blindly landed on the name of a nearby thoroughfare Sawyer Brown Road and derived the new band name Sawyer Brownref nameallmusicref nameoldiesref


The band signed with Capitol Records and scored a Top 20 hit with their first single Leona in 1984ref nameLarkin That success was quickly followed by their first Nonbsp1 hit Step That Stepref nameLarkin The band had their ups and downs on the charts throughout the 1980s landing only sporadic Top 10 hits However by 1990 they had accumulated enough hits for a Greatest Hits package and were successful on the touring circuit

Originally Sawyer Brown was known for a primarily country pop sound dominated largely by novelty tunes by 1991 however the band began to express a more serious side to its music by adding ballads to its repertoireref nameallmusic That year the band also dropped its affiliation with Capitol and Curb Records assumed promotion and distribution of all subsequent albums and singles except for 2003 when Sawyer Brown temporarily switched to Lyric Street Records Bobby Randall also left the band in 1991 and was replaced by Duncan Cameronref nameoldies Cameron subsequently departed in 2004 with Shayne Hill assuming the role of lead guitarist

In 1991 after the release of their album Buick guitarist Bobby Randall left the group to remain close to his family and host a shortlived TV talent show Be a Star Bobby Randall joined to band called Dallas County Line formed in Birmingham AlabamaBirmingham Alabama in late 1991  early 2003 are disbanded Duncan Cameron formerly of The Amazing Rhythm Aces was chosen as his replacement just as Sawyer Brown was about to become country musics it band The band then switched labels moving to Curb Records and releasing the albums The Dirt Road Café on the Corner and Outskirts of Town which saw hit after hit for the band in the early to mid1990sref nameLarkin

Part of the bands newfound success was due to singersongwriter Mac McAnally who wrote several songs for the group The McAnallypenned songs mostly ballads helped to redefine Sawyer Brown who up until this point had been reviled by many critics for being a flamboyant bubble gum pop act that emphasized style over substance The Walk the final single off the Buick album is said to be the turning point for the group

Following The Walk the band scored a number of Top 5 and Top 10 hits including 2 more Billboard Nonbsp1s with 1992s Some Girls Do songSome Girls Do and 1993s Thank God for You which Mark Miller cowrote with Mac McAnally By 1995 Sawyer Brown had enough hits for a second Greatest Hits package The album titled Greatest Hits 1990 to 1995 included two new singles This Time and I Dont Believe in Goodbye which themselves became Top 5 hits

In the latter half of the 1990s the group seemed to gradually fall out of favor with country radio despite a crossover hit in 1999 with Drive Me Wild They parted ways with Curb in 2003 and signed with Lyric Street Records One single was released on Lyric Street before Sawyer Brown left that label as well 2004 saw the group returning to Curb Records just as Duncan Cameron decided to leave the group to pursue a lifelong dream of flying for Southwest Airlines Guitarist Shayne Hill replaced Duncans post as guitarist although both Cameron and Hill are in the credits on Mission Temple Fireworks Stand The albums title track featuring Robert Randolph guitaristRobert Randolph peaked at Nonbsp55 The second single off that album They Dont Understand was a minor Top 40 hit on the country charts and Top 20 on the Christian single charts

 Pop and rock era 

 Bubblegum Osmonds and Homemade 

Record producer Mike Curb saw the Osmonds perform as a band and recognized that they combined a rare mix of polished performing style instrumental skill and vocal talentref nameosmondbroscom He signed the Osmonds to MGM Records and arranged for them to record at Muscle Shoals Sound StudioMuscle Shoals with RB producer Rick Hallref nameInside the Osmonds DVD Under Halls guidance the Osmonds hit the top spot on the pop chart with One Bad Apple in 1971 The song One Bad Apple written by George Jackson songwriterGeorge Jackson was composed in the style of Jackson 5The Jackson 5 it was not originally offered to The Jackson 5refref though the Osmonds would later state that The Jackson 5 considered recording itrefref The Osmond and Jackson families would eventually meet in 1972 and become friendsrefhttpswebarchiveorgweb20101124023137httpjayosmondcomnewshtml Jay pays tribute to Michael Jackson June 26 2009 Retrieved from the Internet Archive June 20 2021ref One Bad Apple debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 on 2 January 1971 first hitting No 1 in February where it stayed for five weeks

The Osmonds soon had hits with other light RBstyle pop numbers like Double Lovin No 14 and YoYo Billy Joe Royal songYoYo No 3 In each of these hits the formula was the same Merrill sang lead and Donny was colead in essence singing the hook or chorus of the song At this time the Osmonds also recorded several songs that were billed to Donny the lead soloist on the songs Sweet and Innocent Donny Osmond songSweet and Innocent No 7 Go Away Little Girl No 1 Hey Girl Freddie Scott songHey Girl No 9 and Puppy Love Paul Anka songPuppy Love No 3 Uni Records also rereleased their 1967 single Flower Music this time with I Cant Stop as the Aside where it reached No 96 Their transition to pop stars required more elaborate choreography than their original work had required so older brother Virl Osmond taught the quintet how to dancerefrefrefref Olive Osmond initially taught the quintet how to sing harmony the harmony arrangements eventually fell upon Wayne who was found to have absolute pitchperfect pitchref namestilltheosmondbrothers

 Transition to rock Phase III and Crazy Horses 

The Osmonds began writing and performing their own music and their sound moved towards rock music beginning with their album Phase III albumPhase III In addition to YoYo Phase III produced the major hit Down by the Lazy River No 4ref nameosmondbroscom Their next Crazy Horses albumCrazy Horses album was the bands first personal statementthe brothers have been quoted as saying that the title song refers to air pollution from cars and its instrumentation featured an even hard rockharder rock sound bordering on early heavy metal musicheavy metal They wrote all the songs and played all the instruments with Alan on rhythm guitar Wayne on lead guitar Merrill on lead vocals and bass Jay on drums and Donny on keyboards all of the brothers sang backing vocals and an occasional lead on album cutsrefref Donny largely switched to instrumental contributions for much of 1972 to accommodate his changing voice by 1973 Donny had settled from his former boy soprano range into a smooth baritenor voice

Donnys voice change was a major upset to the groups original formula for success largely eliminating Merrills youngsounding coleads voice and forcing Merrills mature tenor voice to strain to cover most of the higher notes with audible difficulty through the next few years The success of Crazy Horses singles Hold Her Tight No 14 and title track Crazy Horses songCrazy Horses on which Donny did not sing but did contribute with a prominent keyboard riff kept the group very popular through 1973 As the group toured Donny continued to sing his solo hits with the band progressively lowering the key musickey until his voice change was complete

With their cleancut image talent and energetic poprock sound the Osmonds toured to crowds of fans across the United States By this time the Osmonds had broken through in the United Kingdom as well counting group and solo recordings members of the Osmond family charted 13 singles on the UK charts in 1973 Some observers coined a new word Osmondmania to describe the phenomenon by analogy with the similar Beatlemania of the previous decade The group also had their own Saturdaymorning cartoon series in 1972 and 1973 The Osmonds TV seriesThe Osmonds on American Broadcasting CompanyABCTV

 Emergence as teen balladeers The Plan and Love Me for a Reason 

The older Osmond brothers were of age to go on church missions typically mandatory for members of the church Noting that the Osmonds music career was a major publicity boon for the church that had brought tens of thousands of new members the church exempted the Osmonds from missionary service on the logic that the group served as de facto missionaries for the faith through their fame and musicref nameInside the Osmonds DVDrefhttpwwwdonnycomquestionplview628Did_You_Ever_Serve_A_Mission__And_Were_You_Born_In_The_Churchhtml refref namestilltheosmondbrothers Merrill would eventually serve a mission in 2022 after the group disbandedrefref They recorded an ambitious album in 1973 called The Plan The Osmonds albumThe Plan perhaps best described as a Mormon concept album with progressive rock aspirations One reviewer suggested that The Plan carried a toostrong religious message given that Mormonism is fairly conservative and not usually associated with the themes of rockandroll The reviewer likewise suggested that the music was too varied and too experimentalref ref The album produced only two minor hits Let Me In The Osmonds songLet Me In and Goin Home The Osmonds songGoin Home both No 36 in the United States although they both went top 5 in the United Kingdom and Let Me In was also a major hit on the easy listening charts

Following the release of The Plan the popularity of the Osmonds as a group began to decline Alan Wayne and Merrill all married their wives in 1973 and 1974 Donny married in 1978 Jay would not marry until 1987 and the band began to slow their tour circuitref nameInside the Osmonds DVD  The Plan was also a major departure from the pop music which made them so popular The combination of this album along with Donnys voice change the year before meant that the Osmonds popularity with young fans would wane

Another major factor in the bands decline was the sheer diversity of its output within three years the Osmonds had waffled between bubblegum pop hard rock and easy listening and Donnys solo career as an oldies cover artist further muddled the bands direction Donnys collaboration with Steve and Eydie We Can Make it Together which Alan Wayne and Merrill had penned for Donny came out on the easy listening charts at the same time the much harder Crazy Horses song was charting

 Donnys solo career and the emergence of Marie and Jimmy as spinoff acts 



Donny Marie and Jimmy soon began to emerge as solo artists Jimmy was becoming big in Japan phrasebig in Japan and in 1972 had a No 1 hit in the United Kingdom with Long Haired Lover from Liverpool Marie then 13 years old hit No 1 on the US country chart in 1973 with Paper Roses a song originally recorded by Anita Bryant a decade before Donny had a string of pop hits with cover versioncovers of earlier teenpop songs including Go Away Little Girl No 1 originally by Steve Lawrence Puppy Love songPuppy Love No 3 a Paul Anka composition and The Twelfth of Never No 8 originally recorded by Johnny Mathis Between 1971 and 1976 Donny had twelve Top 40 hits including five in the Top 10 for most of these the Osmonds were still performing as a full band but backing and giving star billing to Donny while he sang lead

Donnys numerous solo hits have led many to assume he was the groups lead singer Merrill was usually the lead singer Donny would usually sing the choruses on songs billed to the Osmonds thus being a colead All five members of the group sang lead at various times Jay would sing lead on some of the groups harder rock tunes while Alan and Wayne would occasionally contribute a lead vocal on some album tracks Donnys emergence as a solo star and the record companys desire to appeal to the teengirl audience often thrust Donny out in front of the groupref name  Inside the Osmonds DVD 

By now the family was touring recording creating and producing for five technically separate artists The Osmonds Donny Osmond Marie Osmond and Jimmy Osmondplus Donny and Marie had begun recording duets and had hits with Im Leaving It Up to You No 4 and Morning Side of the Mountain No 8 Through all the stress and pressures created by these many efforts the family hung together largely at Georges commandref namestilltheosmondbrothers The 2001 American Broadcasting CompanyABCTV movie Inside the Osmonds depicts the family mottoes as being It doesnt matter whos out front as long as its an Osmond and family faith and career In that orderref name  Inside the Osmonds DVD

 Fall from pop prominence The Proud One and Brainstorm 



By 1976 though the groups record sales were softening Their 1975 album The Proud One albumThe Proud One sold poorly despite the Proud One songthe title track a cover of a Frankie Valli minor hit providing a charttopping easy listening hit and the groups last US top40 hit to date and MGM Records was sold to PolyGram Their first album on the subsidiary label Polydor RecordsPolydor was the album Brainstorm that album sold only slightly better than its predecessor and its lead single I Cant Live a Dream another Valli cover fell short of the top 40  Polydor would release two more albums from the family Osmond Family Christmasa Christmas album that included all of the performing family members and a greatest hits compilation

 21stcentury obscurity 

The Osmonds rank among the poorest performers in terms of having their hits of the 1970s survive in recurrent rotation classic hits and oldies stations rarely play any of their music with the occasional exception of One Bad Apple According to Sean Ross at RadioInsight discussing the fifteen popular songs of 1971 that saw the biggest declines in airplay

Nicolette Larson July 17 1952  December 16 1997 was an American singer She is perhaps best known for her work in the late 1970s with Neil Young and her 1978 hit single of Youngs Lotta Love which hit Nonbsp1 on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chartref nameadult and Nonbsp8 on the pop singles chartref nameus It was followed by four more adult contemporary hits two of which were also minor pop hits

By 1985 she shifted her focus to country music charting six times on the US country singles chartref namecountry Her only top40 country hit was Thats How You Know When Loves Right a duet with Steve Wariner She died in 1997 of cerebral edema and liver failure

 Early life and career 
Nicolette Larson was born in Helena Montanaref namelarson2refref namelarsonallm titleBiography Nicolette Larson lastErlewine firstStephen Thomas publisherAllmusic accessdateSeptember 6 2011ref Her fathers employment with the United States Department of the TreasuryUS Treasury Department necessitated frequent relocation for the family She graduated from high school in Kansas City Missouri where she attended the University of MissouriKansas CityUniversity of Missouri for three semesters and worked at waitressing and office jobs before beginning to pursue the musical career she had dreamed of since singing along to the radio as a child

In the early 1970s Larson eventually settled in San Francisco California where she worked in a record store Discount Records on Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley CaliforniaBerkeley which also sold tickets for shows at the Fillmore West and Winterland and for the Golden Gate Country Bluegrass Festival Turning to singing her performance career began with  a booking as the opening act for Eric Andersen at The Egress a club in VancouverVancouver British Columbia In 1975 Larson auditioned for Hoyt Axton who was producing Commander Cody and His Lost Planet AirmenCommander Cody This led to Larson singing with Hoyt Axton and The Banana Band who were opening for Joan Baez on the Diamonds and Rust tour in 1975 She earned her first recording credit on Commander Codys 1975 album Tales From the Ozone toured with his band and also provided background vocals on subsequent Commander Cody albums in 1977 and 1978 Other early career singing credits were for Axton and Guy Clark both in 1976 the following year her resume included further credits with Mary Kay Place Rodney Crowell Billy Joe Shaver Jesse Colin Young Jesse Winchester and Gary Stewart singerGary Stewart

Larson and Guthrie Thomas both had their first professional recording session on Axtons Southbound album for AM Records As newcomers to the recording industry they were listed on the back cover of the album as Street Singers entirely separate from the highly paid more established artists also appearing on the albumrefref

Larsons work with Emmylou Harris  whose 1977 album Luxury Liner albumLuxury Liner prominently showcased Larson on the song Hello Stranger  led to her meeting and then befriending Harriss associate and friend Linda Ronstadt In 1977 Larson was at Ronstadts Malibu CaliforniaMalibu home when neighbor Neil Young phoned to ask Ronstadt if she could recommend a female vocal accompanist Ronstadt suggested Larson she was the third person that day to mention Larson to Young He came over to meet Larson who recalled Neil ran down all the songs he had just written about twenty of them We sang harmonies with him and he was jazzedrefref

The following week Ronstadt and Larson cut their vocals for Youngs American Stars n Bars album at Youngs La Honda CaliforniaLa Honda ranch  the two women were billed on the album as the Bullets  and in November 1977 Young invited Larson to Nashville to sing on his Comes a Time album This led to Larsons being signed to Warner Bros Records

Larson continued her background singing career into 1978 accruing credit on recordings by Marcia Ball Rodney Crowell Emmylou Harris Quarter Moon in a Ten Cent Town and Norton Buffalo She also sang on the Doobie Brothers Minute by Minute That albums producer Ted Templeman then produced Larsons debut album Nicolette albumNicoletteref namelarsonref

 19781983 
Larsons work with Commander Cody had led to her being signed to the country musicCW division of Warner Bros Records However her debut album Nicolette albumNicolette released September 29 1978 was an eclectic mix of rock CW and RB

Despite the release of her album so late in the year Larson was acclaimed Female Vocalist of 1978 by Rolling Stone which wrote no one else could sound as if she were having so much fun on an album Nicolette reached Nonbsp15 on Billboards album chart aided by the hit single Lotta Love a Neil Young composition Larsons Lotta Love hit 1 on the Easy ListeningAdult Contemporary chart and went Top 10 Pop in February 1979 Linda Ronstadt Valerie Carter Bill Payne James Burton and Patrick Simmons performanced on Nicolette albumNicolette albumrefhttpswwwwincityvoicesorgartmusicjeffsplaylistnicolette Nicolette wincityvoicesorg Retrieved 22 August 2024ref 

Warner Brothers also issued the limited edition 5000 copies promoonly Live at the Roxy Theatre West HollywoodRoxy album comprising a December 20 1978 concert given by Larson at the Sunset Boulevard nightclub Larson was also featured on the No Nukes albumNo Nukes album recorded in September 1979 at Madison Square Garden backed by the Doobie Brothers in her performance of Lotta Love

Larson would be unable to consolidate the commercial success augured by her debut the second single off Nicolette Rhumba GirlrefRhumba Girl was written by Jesse Winchester who introduced it as Rhumba Man on his Nothing But a Breeze album Although Larson had been a session singer on Nothing But a Breeze she had not sung on Rhumba Man first hearing the song at a live performance by Winchesterref just missed becoming a major hit for Larson at Nonbsp48 Her second album In the Nick of Time released November 1979 failed to showcase Larsons voice attractively Don Shewey in Rolling Stone wroteblockquoteLarsons roughedged downhome tone is definitely appealing  especially when she backs up the likes of Neil Young and Steve Goodman whose High and Outside album featured a duet with Larson The One That Got Away  but as a soloist her limited vocal resources are severely taxed  Its symptomatic of Nicolette Larsons problems as a performer that the finest singing on In the Nick of Time is by Michael McDonald singerMichael McDonald Let Me Go Lovenbsp McDonalds entrancing vocal presencenbsp so overshadows Larsons that she seems to be playing second fiddle rather than sharing the lead Elsewhere Larson is dwarfed by Ted Templemans typically luxurious productionref namelarsonblockquote

Released as the albums lead single Let Me Go Love reached only Nonbsp35 in February 1980 That year Larson was heard on the airwaves via guest appearances on Say Youll Be Mine by Christopher Cross and the Nitty Gritty Dirt BandDirt Bands Make a Little Magic Larson had enough residual popularity from her debut for In the Nick of Time to become a moderate success Because she had no major hit Larsons 1981 and 1982 album releases Radioland albumRadioland her last album produced by Templeman and All Dressed Up and No Place to Go were unsuccessful even though both releases showed Larson back in strong vocal form In 1982 Larson received some adult contemporary musicadultcontemporary radio airplay with her remake of I Only Want to Be With You No 53refhttpswwwsessiondayscom2022041982nicolettelarsonionlywanttobewithyouus53 I Only Want to Be With You sessiondayscom  Retrieved 22 August 2024ref

Career

1960s
Diamond was not rehired after his 16 weeks with Sunbeam and he began writing and singing his own songs for demos I never really chose songwriting he says It just absorbed me and became more and more important in my liferef nameRS76 His first recording contract was billed as Neil and Jack an The Everly BrothersEverly Brotherstype duet with high school friend Jack Packerref nameRS88 They recorded the unsuccessful singles You Are My Love at Last with What Will I Do and Im Afraid with Till Youve Tried Love both records released in 1962 Cashbox and Billboard magazines gave all four sides positive reviews and Diamond signed with Columbia Records as a solo performer later in 1962 In July 1963 Columbia released the single Clown Town  At Night Billboard gave a laudatory review to Clown Town and Cashbox was complimentary to both sides but it still failed to make the charts Columbia dropped him from their label and he went back to writing songs in and out of publishing houses for the next seven years

Diamond wrote wherever he could including on buses and used an upright piano above the Birdland New York jazz clubBirdland Club in New York City One of the causes of this early nomadic life as a songwriter was his songs wordiness Id spent a lot of time on lyrics and they were looking for hooks and I didnt really understand the nature of that he saysref nameRS76 He was able to sell only about one song a week during those years barely enough to survive He found himself only earning enough to spend 35 cents a day on food equivalent to  in ref nameRS76 But the privacy that he had above the Birdland Club allowed him to focus on writing without distractions Something new began to happen I wasnt under the gun and suddenly interesting songs began to happen songs that had things none of the others didref nameRS76 Among them were Cherry Cherry and Solitary Man songSolitary Man Solitary Man was the first record that Diamond recorded under his own name which made the charts It remains one of his personal favorites as it was about his early years as a songwriter even though he failed to realize it at the time He describes the song as an outgrowth of my despairref nameJackson

Diamond began to feel restricted by Bang Records because he wanted to record more ambitious introspective music such as Brooklyn Roads starting in 1968 Berns wanted to release Kentucky Woman as a single but Diamond was no longer satisfied writing simple pop songs so he proposed Shilo songShilo which was not about the American Civil WarCivil War but rather an imaginary childhood friend Bang believed that the song was not commercial enough so it was relegated to being an LP track on Just for You Neil Diamond albumJust for You Diamond was also dissatisfied with his royalties and tried to sign with another record label after discovering a loophole in his contract that did not bind him exclusively to either WEB IV or Tallyrand but the result was a series of lawsuits that coincided with a slump in his record sales and professional success A magistrate refused WEB IVs request for a temporary injunction to prevent Diamond from joining another record company while his contract dispute continued in court but the lawsuits persisted until February 1977 when he triumphed in court and purchased the rights to his Bangera master tapesref nameJackson

History
The band was formed in Columbus Ohio in 1970 and had its first success in Cincinnati Craig Fuller Tom McGrail Jim Caughlan and John David Call had played together in various bands since high school notably the Vikings the Omars the Sacred Turnips and the Swiss Navy

In 1970 the first Pure Prairie League lineup was Fuller McGrail singersongwriterguitarist George Ed Powell a popular Cincinnati folk singer Phill Stokes bassist in Columbus bands Sanhedrin Move and JD Blackfoot and Robin Suskind a popular guitar teacher in the University of Cincinnati neighborhood on guitar and mandola with John David Call joining the band later that year Calls steel guitar added country credibility to the bands playlist and sparked guitar duels with Fuller that created the signature sound of the band They rose to popularity as the house band at New Dillys Pub in the Mt Adams section of Cincinnati

In mid1971 McGrail and Stokes left the band to rehearse with  but were unable to put a viable band together Jim Caughlan who had played guitar and drums with Fuller Call and McGrail in earlier bands took over on drums and Jim Lanham from California formerly of The Yellow Payges and Country Funk replaced Stokes on bassref nameLarkinref Suskind departed as well soon after the arrival of Caughlan and Lanham 

Early on Pure Prairie League was looking for national artist representation and made contact with a wellknown Cleveland based rock and roll promoter Roger Abramson At the behest of the groups roadie Jim Westy Westermeyer who had also worked for the James Gang Abramson saw the band at New Dillys Pub and later signed them to a management contract Abramson was able to land a contract with RCA Records He then placed Pure Prairie League as an opening act with many of the concerts he produced at that time

Their selftitled Pure Prairie League albumfirst album used a Norman Rockwell The Saturday Evening PostSaturday Evening Post cover showing a trailworn cowboy named Luke who would appear on the cover of every Pure Prairie League recording thereafterref nameLarkin After releasing their debut album recorded in New York City in March 1972 and embarking on a nationwide tour Call Caughlan and Lanham all left the band

At that point Pure Prairie League owed RCA another album and Craig Fuller agreed to record the second record in RCAs Toronto studio with the help of George Ed Powell and Bob Ringe who had also produced the first album Al Brisco played pedal steel guitar on the session Bustin Out begun in the summer of 1972 was produced by Ringe and featured the songs of Fuller and Powellref nameLarkin Billy Hinds from Cincinnati drums percussion joined the band and Hindss friend Michael Connor played piano on most of the sessions and would become a regular in the Pure Prairie League lineup for years to come Mick Ronson added string arrangements to several tracks most notably Boulder Skies and Call Me Tell Meref nameLarkin Michael Reilly who would become the longtime bass player and front man for the band joined in early September 1972 soon after the record was completed Bustin Out was released in October 1972ref nameLarkin

Shortly afterward the group returned to Ohio and Fuller had to face trial for charges of draft evasion in Kentucky Before conscientious objector CO status could be arranged he was sentenced to six months in jail and forced to leave Pure Prairie League in February 1973 At this point RCA dropped the band and their future looked bleak

By August 1973 the band members were in Cincinnati and managed to persuade Call to return Fuller though out of prison by now was working the late shift in a community hospital to satisfy his CO requirements and was not inclined to rejoin at that time He was eventually given a full pardon by President Gerald Ford Reilly took over as the bands leader and front man and brought in his friend Larry Goshorn vocals guitars to replace Fuller in November 1973 Goshorn had played in a popular Ohio band called the Sacred Mushroom

Loggins had a short gig playing guitar for The Electric PrunesThe New Improved Electric Prunesthe New Improved Electric Prunes in 1969 before writing four songs for the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band that were included on their album Uncle Charlie  His Dog Teddyref namePOEMhttpwwwpoemhuntercomlyricskennylogginsbiography Biography Kenny Loggins Poem Huntercomref During his early 20s he was in the band Gator Creek with Mike Deasy The first recorded version of Dannys Song later recorded by Loggins and Messina and a No 7 Hot 100 hit for Anne Murray in 1973 was included on their only album released on Mercury Records

 Loggins and Messina 
Jim Messina musicianJim Messina formerly of Poco bandPoco and Buffalo Springfield was working as an independent record producer for Columbia Records in 1970 when he was introduced to Loggins then a littleknown singersongwriter who was signed to ABC RecordsABCDunhill

The two recorded a number of Logginss compositions in Messinas home living room When Columbia signed Loggins with Messinas help to a sixalbum contract recording began in earnest for Logginss debut album with Messina as producer He assembled The Kenny Loggins Band by summoning his old friends bassist Larry Sims and drummer Merel Bregante both formerly of the Sunshine Company a disbanded 1960s group from Los Angeles violinistmultireedist Al Garth and multireedist Jon Clarke Keyboardist Michael Omartian also played on the album and despite dropping out at the start of the touring continued to play keyboards on the next two albums Los Angelesbased session percussionist Milt Holland described by Messina as an ethnomusicologyethnomusicologist also contributedrefref

Messina originally intended to lend his name to the Loggins project only to help introduce the unknown Loggins to Messinas wellestablished Buffalo Springfield and Poco audiences But by the time the album was completed Messina had contributed so much to the album in terms of songwriting arrangement instrumentation and vocals that an accidental duo was born Thus the full name of their first album was Sittin In Loggins and Messina albumKenny Loggins with Jim Messina Sittin In The albums first single release the Caribbeanflavored Vahevala found top 3 success on WCFL AMWCFL on May 18 1972refref


Although the album went unnoticed by radio upon release it eventually found success by fall 1972 particularly on college campuses where the pair toured heavily Loggins and Messinas vocal harmonies meshed so well that what was begun as a oneoff album became an entity in itself Audiences regarded the pair as a genuine duo rather than as a solo act with a wellknown producer Instead of continuing to produce Loggins as a sole performer they decided to record as a duo Loggins  Messina

When our first album Sittin In came out we started receiving a lot of excitement about the music and good sales Messina recalled in 2005


Both members of the duo were guitarists Loggins played rhythm guitar with both acoustic and electric guitar and harmonica and Messina played lead guitar with both acoustic and electric guitar mandolin and Dobro Over the next four years they produced five more albums of original material in the studio plus one album of Cover versioncovers of other artists material and two live albums They sold 16 million records and were the most successful duo of the early 1970s surpassed later in the decade only by Daryl Hall  John Oatesref nameThibodeaux  Their work also included Lynn Andersons Listen to a Country Song songListen to a Country Song which was released in 1972 and reached Nonbsp4 on the US Billboard magazineBillboard Hot Country Singles chart and Dannys Song and A Love Song Loggins and Messina songA Love Song for Anne Murray which reached Nonbsp7 and Nonbsp12 on the Billboard Hot 100 pop chart in 1973 and 1974 respectively  The latter two songs also hit Nonbsp1 on the Canadian RPM magazineRPM Top Singles chart Later studio albums often found Loggins and Messina more as two solo artists sharing the same record than as a genuine partnership As they both noted in 2005 their collaboration eventually became more a competition Following their January 1976 release of Native Sons Loggins and Messina albumNative Sons and a final concert in Honolulu Hawaii on September 25 1976 the pair amicably and quietly parted to pursue solo careers A greatesthits album The Best of Friends albumThe Best of Friends was released in November 1976 Two months later a live album Finale albumFinale was released more by record company decision than one intended by the artists one year after the duo had come to an end

 Solo career

Two years after Warner Brothers Records dropped Raitt from their label they notified her of their plans to release the Tongue and Groove album I said it wasnt really fair recalled Raitt I think at this point they felt kind of bad I mean I was out there touring on my savings to keep my name up and my ability to draw was less and less So they agreed to let me go in and recut half of it and thats when it came out as Nine Lives Bonnie Raitt albumNine Lives That album released in 1986 to critical and commercial disappointment was Raitts last new recording for Warner Brothersref nameLarkinBlues

Musical styles
Nitty Gritty Dirt Bands music encompasses a wide variety of styles Colin Larkin in The Virgin Encyclopedia of Country Music wrote that their early albums contained jug band and Vaudeville influences while by the release of Uncle Charlie and His Dog Teddy the band abandoned the jokey elementsand pursued a career as purveyors of superior country rockref namevirgin Mark Deming spoke similarly of their early material noting influences of bluegrass musicbluegrass in the Mr Bojangles cover as well as the tracks from the first Will the Circle Be Unbroken album He also defined the bands late1970s output as soft rock and that their 1990s and 21stcentury material was indebted to American folk musicref nameallmusic On the same site Stephen Thomas Erlewine also noticed influences of soft rock on The Dirt Bandref nameerlewine dirt Rickey Ferguson thought the bands country influences were more evident on Plain Dirt Fashion due to the use of instruments such as Dobro fiddle and mandolinref namerickey Holly Gleason noted the twang evident in Hannas and Ibbotsons singing voices and thought the bands rhythm sections were stronger than usual for a country bandref namegleason

During the release of Will the Circle Be Unbroken the band members were noted for their longhaired appearance which at the time was considered counter to the appearances of country music acts at the time Bill Monroe was said to have refused an offer to appear on the album and Roy Acuff was initially apprehensive before joiningref namegone The band said that an impetus behind their shift to country music in the 1980s was the lack of a successful pop song after An American Dream and Make a Little Magic followed by a realization that members of the country music community in Nashville were still fans of their musicref namegone They also thought that the first two Will the Circle Be Unbroken projects helped to dim the lines between pop and country especially since the genre of country rock was still new when the first one was recordedrefref Walter Tunis of the Lexington HeraldLeader thought that the band was an early example of the Californiabased country rock movement of the 1970s furthered by bands such as the Flying Burrito Brothers and Eagles bandEagles and that such a comparison was furthered when former Eagles member Bernie Leadon joined He also thought that the bands success in country in the 1980s was more indebted to marketing and changes in taste from listeners more so than a shift in sound within the band itself Leadon also stated that he heard influences of the Eagles within the Nitty Gritty Dirt Bands songsrefref Jim Wensits of The South Bend Tribune described the band as a coming force in country rock during the success of Mr Bojangles and added that they confounded critics by refusing to be categorized He also thought that the bands sound during the 1970s was comparable to the Eagles and that some songs such as their cover of Jambalaya featured influences of Cajun musicrefref

In a 2022 concert review Jeffrey B Remz of Country Standard Time opined that Jeff Hannas voice was well intact at 75 and that he had an affable easy going stage presence He also noted that Jaime Hanna Carpenter and Fadden occasionally sang lead vocals as well He also praised the use of fiddle and mandolin in their live settingsrefref

Life and career
19591980 Early life and career beginnings
Sheena Shirley Orr was born on 27 April 1959 at Bellshill Maternity Hospital in North Lanarkshire Scotlandrefref the youngest of six children of Annie and steel mill labourer Alex Orr She has two brothers Robert and Alex and three sisters Marilyn Anessa and Morag Her earliestknown public performance as a singer was in 1964 at the age of five when she sang Early One Morning for her uncle and aunt and various relatives at the couples 25th wedding anniversary celebrationref nameOfficial websiteref

Eastons father died in 1969 and her mother had to support the family According to Eastons website despite her mothers heavy workload she was always available for her children Sheena always speaks very highly of her mum and the wonderful job she did in bringing up her and her siblings including teaching them all to read at home before they were even enrolled in schoolref nameOfficial website

Easton did not consider a singing career until she saw the movie The Way We Were with Barbra Streisand Streisands singing over the opening credits overtook the young girl and convinced her that what she wanted most was to be a singer and to have the same effect on othersrefref

Her top grades in school earned her a scholarship to attend the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in Glasgow where she trained from 1975 to 1979 as a speech and drama teacher by day while singing with a band called Something Else by night at local clubsref nameOfficial website She chose to study teaching rather than performing because it was a course of study that would let her perfect her craft as a singerref nameOfficial website

In 1979 she married Sandi Easton the first of her four husbands They divorced after eight months and Sheena decided to keep the surname Easton That year one of her tutors coaxed her into auditioning for Esther Rantzen producer of the BBC programme The Big Time TV seriesThe Big Time Rantzen was planning a documentary film to chronicle a relative unknowns rise to popmusic stardom Easton was selected as the subject for the programme EMI executives awarded her a contract and Christopher Neil was assigned as her recording producer Deke Arlon became her first manager and Easton spent much of 1980 being followed by camera crews who filmed her throughout the process of her audition through to making her first EMI single Modern Girl In the course of the filming she met and sang for Dorothy Squires Dusty Springfield and Lulu singerLulu whose manager Marion Massey told her that she saw Easton as a potential TV star with her own series but not as a pop singer for the 1980s as she lacked rugged individuality

The story behind Mississippi
ref




Mississippi was another song composed by Werner Theunissen It was written in the same vein as Massachusetts Bee Gees songMassachusetts by the Bee Gees a song he liked very much  The band started to play the song live for a few months and later they sent a demo of it to EMI Bovema in Heemstede who were immediately interested  They ended up rerecording the song in the EMI Studio But this did not work out as planned Their producer at that time Eddy Hilberts who had success with a repertoire of country songs gave a country like twist to the song Personally the sisters did not have anything with country music although influenced by the Eagles bandEagles they liked country rockref name3 FM

Mississippi was released as a single in April 1975 Initially it did nothing until Meta de Vries the Dutch radio jockey started playing it  She thought Pussycat bandPussycat was an English band Hans Van Willigenburg played the song on his radio programme as well  During his broadcast he would play three new songs after which listeners could vote by postcard which artist should be invited to his studio  They voted for Pussycat  The group also performed the song for the TV show Herkent U Deze Tijd by Kick Stokhuyzen The same week the single entered the Top 40 in November 1975refref  The following week they performed Mississippi at TopPop and a week later the single had climbed to  1 Although Toni and Marianne still worked as typists for DSM they were unable to maintain their jobs as besides the Netherlands Mississippi had become No 1 in Germany as well As their fame grew the band realized they needed a manager so their record company got them their new manager Jan Buysref namePussycat Nostalgiaref
