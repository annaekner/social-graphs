Musical styles
Nitty Gritty Dirt Bands music encompasses a wide variety of styles Colin Larkin in The Virgin Encyclopedia of Country Music wrote that their early albums contained jug band and Vaudeville influences while by the release of Uncle Charlie and His Dog Teddy the band abandoned the jokey elementsand pursued a career as purveyors of superior country rockref namevirgin Mark Deming spoke similarly of their early material noting influences of bluegrass musicbluegrass in the Mr Bojangles cover as well as the tracks from the first Will the Circle Be Unbroken album He also defined the bands late1970s output as soft rock and that their 1990s and 21stcentury material was indebted to American folk musicref nameallmusic On the same site Stephen Thomas Erlewine also noticed influences of soft rock on The Dirt Bandref nameerlewine dirt Rickey Ferguson thought the bands country influences were more evident on Plain Dirt Fashion due to the use of instruments such as Dobro fiddle and mandolinref namerickey Holly Gleason noted the twang evident in Hannas and Ibbotsons singing voices and thought the bands rhythm sections were stronger than usual for a country bandref namegleason

During the release of Will the Circle Be Unbroken the band members were noted for their longhaired appearance which at the time was considered counter to the appearances of country music acts at the time Bill Monroe was said to have refused an offer to appear on the album and Roy Acuff was initially apprehensive before joiningref namegone The band said that an impetus behind their shift to country music in the 1980s was the lack of a successful pop song after An American Dream and Make a Little Magic followed by a realization that members of the country music community in Nashville were still fans of their musicref namegone They also thought that the first two Will the Circle Be Unbroken projects helped to dim the lines between pop and country especially since the genre of country rock was still new when the first one was recordedrefref Walter Tunis of the Lexington HeraldLeader thought that the band was an early example of the Californiabased country rock movement of the 1970s furthered by bands such as the Flying Burrito Brothers and Eagles bandEagles and that such a comparison was furthered when former Eagles member Bernie Leadon joined He also thought that the bands success in country in the 1980s was more indebted to marketing and changes in taste from listeners more so than a shift in sound within the band itself Leadon also stated that he heard influences of the Eagles within the Nitty Gritty Dirt Bands songsrefref Jim Wensits of The South Bend Tribune described the band as a coming force in country rock during the success of Mr Bojangles and added that they confounded critics by refusing to be categorized He also thought that the bands sound during the 1970s was comparable to the Eagles and that some songs such as their cover of Jambalaya featured influences of Cajun musicrefref

In a 2022 concert review Jeffrey B Remz of Country Standard Time opined that Jeff Hannas voice was well intact at 75 and that he had an affable easy going stage presence He also noted that Jaime Hanna Carpenter and Fadden occasionally sang lead vocals as well He also praised the use of fiddle and mandolin in their live settingsrefref

Prolific songwriter
Jenkins proved a master at crafting topical songs from traditional musical and lyrical forms For example Floyd Collins opened with two lines that came directly from an old British ballad

Oh come all you young peoplebr 
and listen while I tellbr 
The fate of Floyd Collinsbr 
a lad we all know wellref nameWolfe p 191 

Jenkins was adept at more than just ballads turning out one song after another as his stepdaughter Irene described it like a mill grinding wheatref nameKenney p 149  Many of his topical compositions were recorded by other artists over the ensuing years including Billy the Kid drawn from a popular 1926 biography of the cowboy killer The Wreck of the Royal Palm about a twotrain collision in Georgia in 1926 The Tragedy on Daytona Beach based on the 1929 death of race car driver Lee Bible in Florida The Fate of Frank Dupre the story of an Atlanta robberymurder and Ben Dewberrys Final Run which recounted the death of an Atlantan who was the engineer in a 1908 train wreckref name  Georgia ref nameMcNeil p 205McNeil p 205refref nameMiller p 161Miller p 161ref In all he wrote more than 300 nonsacred songs many of them news balladsref nameMcNeil p 205 

Although the genres popularity lasted just one brief year country artists returned to the form again and againrefPeterson p 31ref  in the late 1920s pioneers such as Jimmie Rodgers country singerJimmie Rodgers and the Carter Family and in the 1930s early folk artists such as Woody Guthrie and Lead BellyrefWolfe p 197198ref The genre was revisited during the folk revival of the 1950s and 1960s in particular by Bob Dylan who wrote one of his first songs based on the same formula used by Jenkins and Phil Ochs many of whose songs came directly from newspaper headlines

Meanwhile Jenkins earned very little from the songs he wroteref nameMcNeil p 205McNeil p 205ref The hit The Death of Floyd Collins for example brought him just 25 and under his agreement with the producer he was working with at Okeh he also gave up all rights to the songrefPeterson p 2425ref After experiencing copyright problems Jenkins began keeping meticulous records of his songs The practice eventually paid off Years later after Mahalia Jackson recorded one of his gospel songs God Put a Rainbow in the Sky his stepdaughter Irene was able to prove the song was not in the public domain but was Jenkinss compositionref nameMiller p 161 

Last recordings and later years

The Jenkins Familys popularity opened Rev Jenkinss ministry to a wide audience as they performed at concerts and organized revival meetings throughout Georgia Over time Jenkins also served as pastor of several churches In 1939 he lost his eyesight completely yet continued to preach until the time of his death and also broadcast as an evangelist on border blasterMexicos powerful uncontrolled radio stationsref nameMiller p 161

Jewish songs
Guthries second wife Marjorie Mazia was born Marjorie Greenblatt and her mother Aliza Greenblatt was a wellknown Yiddish poet Guthrie wrote numerous Jewish lyrics which can be linked to his close collaborative relationship with Aliza Greenblatt who lived near Guthrie and his family in Brooklyn in the 1940s Guthrie the Oklahoma troubadour and Greenblatt the Jewish wordsmith often discussed their artistic projects and critiqued each others works finding common ground in their shared love of culture and social justice Their collaboration flourished in 1940s Brooklyn where Jewish culture was interwoven with music modern dance poetry and antifascist prolabor socialist activism Guthrie was inspired to write songs that arose from this unlikely relationship he identified the problems of Jews with those of his fellow Okies and other oppressed peoples

These lyrics were rediscovered by Nora Guthrie and were set to music by the Jewish Klezmer group The Klezmatics with the release of Happy Joyous Hanukkah on JMG Records in 2007 The Klezmatics also released Wonder Wheelnbsp Lyrics by Woody Guthrie an album of spiritual lyrics put to music composed by the bandrefWoodyGuthrieorg httpwwwwoodyguthrieorgmerchandiseklezmaticshtm Happy Joyous Hanukkah  Wonder Wheel Retrieved October 13 2008ref The album produced by Danny Blume was awarded a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary World Music Albumref namecdbabyklezref

The postaccident investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board NTSB showed that the leading cause of the accident was Denvers inability to switch fuel tanks during flight The quantity of fuel had been depleted during the planes flight to Monterey and in several brief practice takeoffs and landings Denver performed at the airport immediately before the final flight His newly purchased amateurbuilt Rutan aircraft had an unusual fuel tank selector valve handle configuration The handle had originally been intended by the planes designer to be between the pilots legs The builder instead put it behind the pilots left shoulder The fuel gauge was also placed behind the pilots seat and was not visible to the person at the controlsref nameAVW ref nameNTSB  An NTSB interview with the aircraft mechanic servicing Denvers plane revealed that he and Denver had discussed the inaccessibility of the cockpit fuel selector valve handle and its resistance to being turnedref nameAVW ref nameNTSB 

Before the flight Denver and the mechanic had attempted to extend the reach of the handle using a pair of Locking pliersViseGrip pliers but this did not solve the problem and the pilot still could not reach the handle while strapped into his seat NTSB officials postaccident investigation showed that because of the fuel selector valves positioning switching fuel tanks required the pilot to turn his body 90 degrees to reach the valve This created a natural tendency to extend ones right foot against the right rudder pedal to support oneself while turning in the seat which caused the aircraft to Aircraft principal axesyaw nose right and pitch upref nameAVW ref nameNTSB 

The mechanic said that he told Denver that the fuel sight gauges were visible only to the rear cockpit occupant Denver had asked how much fuel was shown He told Denver that there was less than half in the right tank and less than a quarter in the left tank He then provided Denver with an inspection mirror so he could look over his shoulder at the fuel gauges The mirror was later recovered from the wreckage Denver said that he would use the autopilot in flight to hold the airplane level while he turned the fuel selector valve He turned down an offer to refuel the aircraft saying that he would only be flying for about an hourref nameAVW ref nameNTSB 

The NTSB interviewed 20 witnesses about Denvers last flight Six of them had seen the plane crash into the bay near Point Pinosref nameAVW ref nameNTSB  Four said the aircraft was originally heading west Five said that they saw the plane in a steep bank with four saying that the bank was to the right north Twelve described seeing the aircraft in a steep nosedown descent Witnesses estimated the planes altitude between  when heading toward the shoreline Eight said they heard a pop or backfire accompanied by a reduction in the engine noise level just before the plane crashed into the sea

In addition to Denvers failing to refuel and his subsequent loss of control while attempting to switch fuel tanks the NTSB determined other key factors that led to the accident Foremost among these was his inadequate transition training on this type of aircraft and the builders decision to put the fuel selector handle in a hardtoreach placeref nameAVW ref nameNTSB  The board issued recommendations on the requirement and enforcement of mandatory training standards for pilots operating homebuilt aircraft It also emphasized the importance of mandatory ease of access to all controls including fuel selectors and fuel gauges in all aircraft

Hillman became known in San Diegos folk music community as a solid player this won him an invitation to join his first band the Scottsville Squirrel Barkersref nameLarkinCountry The band lasted barely two years recording only one album Blue Grass Favorites which was distributed in supermarkets however it has a posthumous reputation as the spawning ground for a number of musicians who went on to play in the Eagles the Flying Burrito Brothers the Byrds Hearts  Flowers and the Country Gazette bandCountry Gazette When the band broke up in late 1963 Hillman received an invitation to join the Golden State Boys regarded as the top bluegrass band in southern California and featuring future country star Vern Gosdin his brother Rex and banjoist Don Parmley later of the Bluegrass Cardinals Shortly thereafter the band changed its name to The Hillmenref nameLarkinCountry soon Hillman was appearing regularly on television and using a fictitious ID Chris Hardin to allow the underage musician into the country bars where many of his gigs were played When the Hillmen folded he briefly joined a spinoff of Randy Sparks The New Christy MinstrelsNew Christy Minstrels known as the Green Grass Revival

At this point a frustrated Hillman considered quitting music and enrolling at UCLA when he received an offer from The Hillmens former manager and producer Jim Dickson to join Jim later Roger McGuinn David Crosby Gene Clark and Michael Clarke in a new band The Byrdsref nameLarkinCountry Hillman was recruited to play bass guitar although he had never picked up the instrument Thanks to his bluegrass background he quickly developed his own melodic style on the instrument The Byrds first single a jangly cover of Bob Dylans Mr Tambourine Man was an international hit and marked the birth of folk rock During the mid1960s the Byrds ranked as one of the most successful and influential American pop groups they recorded a string of hits including Turn Turn Turn Eight Miles High and So You Want to Be a Rock n Roll Star

Hillman kept a low profile on the bands first two albums on which McGuinn and Clark shared lead vocals with Crosby adding high harmony and singing the bridge on All I Really Want to Do However Clarks departure in 1966 and Crosbys growing restlessness allowed Hillman the opportunity to develop as a singer and songwriter in the group He came into his own on the Byrds 1967 album Younger Than Yesterday cowriting and sharing lead vocals with McGuinn on the hit So You Want to Be a Rock n Roll Starref nameLarkinCountry Hillman also wrote and sang the minor hit Have You Seen Her Face Thoughts and Words Time Between and The Girl with No Name the latter two demonstrating his bluegrass and country roots Hillmans prominence continued with the Byrds next album The Notorious Byrd Brothers on which he shared songwriting credit on seven of the albums eleven songs

Nothin Fancy and East Coast Bluegrass Band continued to coexist until 2000 when East Coast Bluegrass Bands members drifted apart and had to reorganize

 Notable Changes 
Chris Sexton who had appeared with Nothin Fancy for their firstplace victory in the band competition at the Maury River Fiddlers Convention in 1998 and recorded as a guest fiddler on the bands second and third releases Earn Your Ticket and Field of Dreams respectively officially became the newest member of Nothin Fancy in 2000  The fourth project Now and Then is the first album to feature the fivepiece group as it is today

Shorter departed from the group in 2005 and was replaced by Eli Johnston of Branson MO  Nothin Fancy released Album Nonbsp7 under Pinecastle with Johnston and featured him as the lead vocal on the song Tupelo County Jail but Johnston only stayed with the group for 13 months  Citing artistic differences he left the group and joined the band Pine Mountain Railroad  Nothin Fancys members called Shorter back into service in time for the 6th Annual Nothin Fancy Bluegrass Festival  Shorter who at the time was playing bass for country star Keith Bryant happily agreed and the band was reunited with its original cast and has stayed as such since

Gary Farris the guitar player also departed the group in July 2012 and was replaced by Justin Tomlinrefhttpbluegrasstodaycomjustintomlintonothinfancy Justin Tomlin to Nothin Fancy Bluegrass Todayref Tomlin left in March 2014 and Jesse Smathers joined the group in his placerefhttpbluegrasstodaycomjessesmatherstonothinfancy Jesse Smathers to Nothin Fancy Bluegrass Todayref In June 2015 Jesse Smathers departed the group and was replaced by guitar and dobro player Caleb Coxrefhttpbluegrasstodaycomjessesmatherstolonesomeriverband Jesse Smathers to Lonesome River Band Bluegrass Todayref A month later the band signed a recording contract with Mountain Fever Records and released their first project for the label By Any Other Name in August 2015refhttpbluegrasstodaycomnothinfancytomountainfever Nothin Fancy to Mountain Fever Bluegrass Todayref

 Recordings 

East Coast Bluegrass Band released four selfproduced albums  They then contracted Tim Austin of Doobie Shea RecordsDoobie Shea Studios to produce and record the project Recording began in February 1996 Later that spring lightning struck and destroyed the studio and all the recorded sessions Once it was up and running again they were one of the first acts to record in the new studioref namesamhillbandscom After four albums thirteen years and hundreds of performances the band released their first nationally distributed recording project Lifes Mysteries on Copper Creek Records

The group now appearing as Nothin Fancy was approached by Pinecastle Records and signed to the label in 2002  They recorded their fifth project Once Upon a Road with the title song written for the band by Tom T Hall and his wife Dixie  Once Upon a Road rose to number 10 on the Bluegrass Charts as posted by Bluegrass Unlimited  Their bluegrass gospel song When the Angels Take My Hand rose to the Number 1 spot on the Bluegrass Gospel charts as posted by the nowdefunct Bluegrass Now magazine  The album also earned them a showcase at the International Bluegrass Music Association IBMA Convention in October 2002 and a nomination for the International Bluegrass Music AwardsIBMA Emerging Artist of the Year Award

Their sixth album Reflections was a much more personal album with Andes penning 10 of the 13 songs  It featured the novelty single I Met My Baby in the PortaJohn Line as a bonus track also by Andes  Reflections was not as commercially successful as Once Upon a Road but it was from these two albums and the performances from this period that Nothin Fancy had found its highly unique voice which paid homage to bands such as the The Country GentlemenCountry Gentlemen and the Seldom Scene  The late Charlie Waller American musicianCharlie Waller a founding member of the The Country GentlemenCountry Gentlemen who went on to lead that group until his death in 2004 met with Andes at the httpwwwspbgmacom Society for the Preservation of Bluegrass Music of America annual convention and learned the song Heaven Got an Angel from Andes that was recorded originally on Field of Dreams and recorded it on the The Country GentlemenCountry Gentlemen album Cryin in the Chapel

 Musical style and sound 
The band seeks to remain true to the traditional sounds of the great bluegrass bands of the 1940s and 50sref namesamhillbandscom while also performing and recording original songs by their prolific songwriter lead singer Mike Andes  Classic bluegrass material draws from Bill Monroe Ralph Stanley the The Country GentlemenCountry Gentlemen and the Seldom Scene but song selection ranges from original material to gospel classics to covers of pop artists such as Bob Seger Bruce Springsteen Bill Withers Bob Dylan and Creedence Clearwater Revival

In live performance Nothin Fancy has been noted for its strong vocals fourpart arrangements and its highenergy shows wellseasoned with humor  The quintets early years saw the band gathering around one microphone employing a shellgame choreography for solos and backup which keeps the show visually active as well as aurally pleasing although the most recent configuration is more traditional with individual microphones for instruments and vocals Andes clear singing style is attributed to the unique stylings of Charlie Waller American musicianCharlie Waller whose earthy bassbaritone voice sang with clear enunciation  Farris sings a bold tenor harmony remarkable for its projection his powerful delivery has been likened to the late John Duffey of the Seldom Scene  Shorter occasionally sings baritone harmonies an octave higher while Davis sings bass vocals more on gospel songs In later recordings Davis gave up singing bass and allowed Sexton to sing bass on gospel songs

Nothin Fancy Bluegrass Festival
In 2001 a Rockbridge County entrepreneur Morris OShields created a bluegrass festival at the Glen Maury Park the site of the Maury River Fiddlers Convention where Nothin Fancy won its victory three years before  The festival was named for Nothin Fancy who have served as the host act in years sincerefhttpwwwrockbridgeweeklycomrw_articlephpndx9737 Rockbridge Weekly Virginia Based Bluegrass Band Nothin Fancy Garners National Music Awardref  Just as the band originally named itself after the first music festival in which it competedsubsequently winning the prizeit then had a music festival whose competition it had also won subsequently named for it

The sonamed festival has become a muchloved annual event that brings scores of bluegrass fans to the Shenandoah Valley and to the little town of Buena Vista VA where Farris calls home and from which the band operates  Held each year at the Glen Maury Park in Buena Vista Virginia the music festivalfestival has perennially played host to major bluegrass musicbluegrass musical groupbands  The 2008 music festivalfestival for example included such names as Rhonda Vincent Michelle Nixon Blue Mountain Sunrise The Deer Creek Boys The Country GentlemenRandy Waller  the Country Gentlemen Blue Moon Rising and the httpwwwthegarywaldrepbandcom Gary Waldrep BandrefhttpwwwcybergrasscommodulesphpnameNewsfilearticlesid5313 Cybergrass SPBGMA Entertaining Group Of The Year Nothin Fancy To Host Bluegrass Fest September 10 2008ref  It has also hosted bands and artists such as IIIrd Tyme Out the httpwwwlonesomeriverbandcom Lonesome River Band Missy Raines Marty Raybon The Dillards the Lewis Family httpwwwgoldwingexpressnet Goldwing Express httpwwwlarrystephensonbandcom Larry Stephenson httpwwwmarknewtonbandcom Mark Newton Doyle Lawson and httpwwwcharliesizemorebandcom Charlie Sizemore

With regard to his guitar technique Matsson uses a variety of open tunings and standard tuning to a lesser degree He had classical guitar training in his youth but says he never really focused on it and that by the end of high school he got bored playing guitar because it was like mathrefref until he then discovered open tunings while listening to Nick Drake in his early twenties He was drawn to this style of playing because it allowed him to focus on singing while still performing intricate music
