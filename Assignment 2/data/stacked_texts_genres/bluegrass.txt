Reception

Geoffrey Himes of The Washington Post described Welch as one of the most interesting singersongwriters of her generationref namewash_post_2001  In 2003 Tom Kielty of The Boston Globe observed that she was quietly establishing one of the most impressive catalogs in contemporary roots music and a 2007 piece in The Guardian by John Harris called Welch one of the decades greatest talentsref nameguardian_2007 ref nameboston_2003  Critic Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times wrote At every turn she demonstrates a spark and commitment that should endear her to anyone from country and folk to pop and rock fans who appreciate imagination and heartref namelatimes_1996 

When Welchs first two albums came out critics questioned the authenticity of her music as she was raised in Southern California but performed Appalachian themed songsref nametheage_bevhillybilly ref namewsj_1998 ref nameboston_globe_1998  For Revival Welch was criticized for manufacturing emotion and a review of Hell Among the Yearlings by Chris Herrington of City Pages stated Welch is someone who discovered oldtime music in college and decided that her own sheltered life could never be worth writing about and that she is completely devoid of individualityref namerollingstone_revival ref nameminn_city_pages  Other critics rejected the notion that her background affects the authenticity of her music Music critic Mark Kemp defended Welch in a New York Times piece

blockquoteThe firstperson protagonist of Ms Welchs song Caleb Meyer may be a young girl from a time and place that Ms Welch will never fully understand but the feelings the singer expresses about rape and the respect she displays for her chosen musical genre are nothing if not poignantly authentic Likewise it matters not whether Ms Welch has ever walked the streets of the black dust towns of East Tennessee about which she sings in Miners Refrain because the sense of foreboding that she expresses for the men who once labored in coal mines with futile hopes of a better life comes through loud and clearref namenyt_1998  blockquote

The Wall Street Journals Taylor Holliday echoed this Stingy critics give Ms Welch a hard time because shes a California city girl not an Appalachian coal miners daughter But as Lucinda WilliamsLucinda or Emmylou might attest love of the music is not a birthright but an earned right Listen to Ms Welch yodel in a tune about that nogood gal Morphine and you know shes as mountain as they comeref namewsj_1998

Musical career
Whitley is known for his neotraditional brand of country popularized by hit artists such as George Strait and Randy Travis

In 1969 he performed in a musical contest in Ezel Kentucky with brother Dwight on fivestring banjo Ricky Skaggs was also in the contest Skaggs and Whitley instantly bonded and subsequently became close friendsref nameRoweNRTD19860420Rowe Norman  Album Echoes Country Classics  Richmond TimesDispatch  April 20 1986ref

Whitley and Skaggs both sixteen years old were discovered in Ft Gay West Virginia by Ralph Stanley who was 45 minutes late for a gig due to a flat tire Stanley opened the door of the club and heard what he thought was the Stanley Brothers playing on a jukebox However it was Whitley and Skaggs who sounded just like me and Carter in the early days The two soon joined Stanleys band Whitley became lead singer for Stanley in 1974  Whitley also played with JD Crowe  the New South in the mid1970sref nameAP During this period he established himself as one of the most versatile and talented lead singers in bluegrass His singing was heavily influenced by Carter Stanley and Lefty Frizzell He moved to Nashville in 1983 to pursue a country music career and soon signed a record deal with RCA Recordsref nameAP

Whitleys first solo album A Hard Act to Follow was released in 1984 and featured a more mainstream country style While Whitley was working hard to achieve his own style the songs he produced were inconsistent Critics regarded the album as too erratic Whitley honed his sound within the next few years for his next album LA to Miami

LA to Miami released in 1985 would give him his first Top 20 country hit single Miami My Amy The song was followed by three more hit songs Ten Feet Away Homecoming 63 and Hard Livin The album also included On the Other Hand and Nobody in His Right Mind Wouldve Left Her On the Other Hand was pitched to Whitley before Randy Travis released the song as a single and when Whitleys version wasnt released as a single Travis released his in 1986 as did George Strait with Nobody in His Right Mind Wouldve Left Her

During his tour to promote LA to Miami he met and began a romantic relationship with country singer Lorrie Morgan They were married in November 1986 and  had their only child a son Jesse Keith Whitley in June 1987 Whitley also adopted Lorries daughter Morgan from her first marriage

During the new recording sessions in 1987 Whitley began feeling that the songs he was  were not up to his standards so he approached RCA and asked if the project of 15 songs could be shelved He also asked if he could take a major role in creating the songs and in production The new album titled Dont Close Your Eyes albumDont Close Your Eyes was released in 1988 and the album sold extremely well The album contained one of the many songs that Whitley had a hand in writing in his years at Tree Publishing Its All Coming Back to Me Now On the album was a remake of Lefty Frizzells classic standard I Never Go Around Mirrors and the song became a huge hit at Whitleys concerts The first three singles from the albumWhen You Say Nothing at All Im No Stranger to the Rain and the title cutall reached No 1 on Billboard magazineBillboards country charts during the autumn of 1988 and the winter of 1989 with the title track Dont Close Your Eyes being ranked as Billboards No 1 Country song of 1988 Shortly thereafter Im No Stranger to the Rain also earned Whitley his first and only Country Music Association award as a solo artist and a Grammy nomination for Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal PerformanceBest Country Vocal Performance Male

In early 1989 Whitley approached RCA chairman Joe Galante with the intention of releasing I Never Go Around Mirrors as a single Galante approved of the musical flexibility that Whitley achieved with the song however he suggested that Whitley record something new and more upbeat The result was a song Whitley had optioned for his previous album called I Wonder Do You Think of Me and was to result in his next album release

Legacy
Several film projects depicting Whitleys life were slated but none have come to fruition One idea was a film version of the George VesceyLorrie Morganpenned Forever Yours Faithfully While Morgans book was a benchmark in piecing together Whitleys final moments perhaps the most research went into a project titled Kentucky Bluebird which was to star writeractordirector David L KeithDavid Keith This project was in development hell for several years and was halted in late 2006 after difficulties with casting and funding Another film project started in 2004 by songwriter Jeff Swope was a biopic chronicling Whitleys life and passing The last information about the project came in 2010 when he announced that preproduction was set to begin pending investorsrefMirrors The Keith Whitley Story  WordPress April 13 2010ref

Whitley is the only person to be posthumously recognized as a former member of the Grand Ole Opry without ever being an active member Management had scheduled Whitley for an appearance in late May 1989 where he was to be invited to join but his death on May 9 interrupted those plans As the Opry has a policy only inducting living artists as members Whitleys induction was scrapped During a Keith Whitley tribute show at the Opry on October 14 2023 Garth Brooks and Lorrie Morgan announced that Whitleys name would be engraved on a plaque and included in the Oprys Member Gallery backstage alongside every act who has held Opry membership at some point in the shows history dating to 1925

Monroe was born on Bill Monroe Farmhis familys farm near Rosine Kentucky the youngest of eight children of James Buchanan Buck and Malissa Vandiver Monroe His mother and her brother Pendleton VandiverJames Pendleton Pen Vandiver were both musically talented and Monroe and his family grew up playing and singing at homeref nameLarkinGE

Bill was of Scottish AmericansScottish and English AmericansEnglish heritage Because his older brothers Birch and Charlie MonroeCharlie already played the fiddle and guitar Bill was resigned to playing the less desirable mandolinref nameLarkinGE He recalled that his brothers insisted that he remove four of the mandolins eight strings so he would not play too loudly

Monroes mother died when he was ten and his father died six years laterref nameLarkinGE Eventually his brothers and sisters moved away leaving Monroe to bounce between uncles and aunts until finally settling in with his disabled uncle Pendleton Vandiver whom he often accompanied when Vandiver played the fiddle at dances This experience inspired one of Monroes most famous compositions Uncle Pen recorded in 1950ref nameLarkinGE and the 1972 album Bill Monroes Uncle Pen On that album Monroe recorded a number of traditional fiddle tunes he had often heard performed by Vandiver Vandiver has been credited with giving Monroe a repertoire of tunes that sank into Bills aurally trained memory and a sense of rhythm that seeped into his bonesrefref

Also significant in Monroes musical life was Arnold Shultz an influential fiddler and guitarist who introduced Monroe to the bluesrefrefrefThe Father of Bluegrass Music DVD Documentary 1993ref

Professional career
In 1929 Monroe moved to Indiana to work at an oil refinery with his brothers Birch MonroeBirch and Charlieref nameLarkinGE Together with a friend Larry Moore they formed the Monroe Brothers to play at local dances and house parties

Birch and Moore soon left the group and Bill and Charlie carried on as a duo eventually winning spots performing live on radio stations first in Indiana and then sponsored by Texas Crystals on several radio broadcasts in Shenandoah Iowa Nebraska South Carolina and North Carolina from 1934 to 1936ref nameLarkinGE RCA RecordsPrevious labelsRCA Victor signed the Monroe Brothers to a recording contract in 1936ref nameLarkinGE They scored an immediate hit single with the gospel song What Would You Give in Exchange For Your Soul and ultimately recorded 60 tracks for Victors Bluebird RecordsBluebird label between 1936 and 1938refref

After the Monroe Brothers disbanded in 1938 Bill Monroe formed The Kentuckians in Little Rock Arkansas but the group only lasted for three monthsref nameLarkinGE Monroe then left Little Rock for Atlanta Georgia to form the first edition of the Blue Grass Boysref nameLarkinGE with singerguitarist Cleo Davis fiddler Art Wooten and bassist Amos Garren

In October 1939 Monroe successfully auditioned for a regular spot on the Grand Ole Opry impressing Opry founder George D Hay with his energetic performance of Jimmie Rodgers country singerJimmie Rodgerss Mule Skinner Bluesref nameLarkinGE Monroe recorded that song along with seven others at his first solo recording session for RCA Victor in 1940 by this time the Blue Grass Boys consisted of singerguitarist Clyde Moody fiddler Tommy Magness and bassist Bill Wesbrooksrefref

While the fast tempos and instrumental virtuosity characteristic of bluegrass music are apparent even on these early tracks Monroe was still experimenting with the sound of his group He seldom sang lead vocals on his Victor recordings often preferring to contribute high tenor harmonies as he had in the Monroe Brothers A 1945 session for Columbia Records featured an accordion soon dropped from the band Most importantly Monroe added banjo player David Stringbean Akeman to the Blue Grass Boys in 1942ref nameLarkinGE Akeman played the instrument in a relatively primitive style and was rarely featured in instrumental solos Monroes pre1946 recordings represent a transitional style between the string bandstringband tradition from which he came and the musical innovation to follow

 Original Bluegrass Band and Monroes heyday as a star 

Key developments occurred in Monroes music with the addition of Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs to the Blue Grass Boys in December 1945ref nameLarkinGE Flatt played a solid rhythm guitar style that would help to set the course for bluegrass timing Scruggs played the banjo with a distinctive threefinger picking style that immediately caused a sensation among Opry audiences Flatt and Scruggs joined a highly accomplished group that included fiddler Howdy Forrester and bassist Joe Forrester and would soon include fiddler Chubby Wise and bassist Howard Watts who often performed under the name Cedric Rainwater

In retrospect this lineup of the Blue Grass Boys has been dubbed the Original Bluegrass Band as the music finally included all the elements that characterize bluegrass music including breakneck tempos sophisticated vocal harmony arrangements and impressive instrumental proficiency demonstrated in solos or breaks on the mandolin banjo and fiddle By this time Monroe had acquired the 1923 Gibson F5 model Lloyd Loar mandolin which became his trademark instrument for the remainder of his careerrefRosenberg Neil V 2005 BLUEGRASS A History Urbana Ill University of Illinois Press ref

The 28 songs recorded by this version of the Blue Grass Boys for Columbia Records in 1946 and 1947 soon became classics of the genre including Toy Heart Blue Grass Breakdown Molly and Tenbrooks Wicked Path of Sin My Rose of Old Kentucky Little Cabin Home on the Hill and Monroes most famous song Blue Moon of Kentuckyref nameLarkinGE which was recorded by Elvis Presley in 1954 appearing as the Bside of his first single for Sun Records Monroe gave his blessing to Presleys rock and roll cover of the song originally a slow ballad in waltz time and rerecorded it himself with a faster arrangement after Presleys version became a hitref nameLarkinGE Several gospelthemed numbers are credited to the Blue Grass Quartet which featured fourpart vocal arrangements accompanied solely by mandolin and guitar  Monroes usual practice when performing sacred songs

Both Flatt and Scruggs left Monroes band in early 1948 soon forming their own group the Foggy Mountain Boys In 1949 after signing with Decca Records Monroe entered what has been called the golden age of his careerrefBill Monroe and Bluegrass by Roughstock staff January 27 2009 ref with what many consider the classic high lonesome version of the Blue Grass Boys featuring the lead vocals and rhythm guitar of Jimmy Martin the banjo of Rudy Lyle replacing Don Reno and fiddlers such as Merle Red Taylor Charlie Cline Bobby Hicks and Vassar Clements

This band recorded a number of bluegrass classics including My Little Georgia Rose On and On Memories of Mother and Dad and Uncle Pen as well as instrumentals such as Roanoke Big Mon Stoney Lonesome Get Up John and the mandolin feature Raw Hide Carter Stanley joined the Blue Grass Boys as guitarist for a short time in 1951 during a period when The Stanley Brothers had temporarily disbanded

On January 16 1953 Monroe was critically injured in a twocar wreckref nameLarkinGE He and Bluegrass Boys bass player Bessie Lee Mauldin were returning home from a fox hunt north of Nashville TennesseeNashville On highway 31W near White House their car was struck by a drunken driver Monroe who had suffered injuries to his back left arm and nose was rushed to General Hospital in Nashville It took him almost four months to recover and resume touringref nameLarkinGE In the meantime Charlie Cline and Jimmy Martin kept the band togetherref nameRosenberg

By the late 1950s however Monroes commercial fortunes had begun to slipref nameLarkinGE The rise of rockandroll and the development of the Nashville sound in mainstream country music both represented threats to the viability of bluegrass While still a mainstay on the Grand Ole Opry Monroe found diminishing success on the singles charts and struggled to keep his band together in the face of declining demand for live performances

Folk revival

Monroes fortunes began to improve during the American folk music revival of the early 1960s Many college students and other young people were beginning to discover Monroe associating his style more with traditional folk music than with the countryandwestern genre with which it had previously been identified

The word bluegrass first appeared around this time to describe the sound of Monroe and similar artists such as Flatt and Scruggs the Stanley Brothers Reno and Smiley Jim  JesseJim and Jesse and the Osborne Brothers While Flatt and Scruggs immediately recognized the potential for a lucrative new audience in cities and on college campuses in the North Monroe was slower to respond Under the influence of Ralph Rinzler a young musician and folklorist from New Jersey who briefly became Monroes manager in 1963 Monroe gradually expanded his geographic reach beyond the traditional southern country music circuitref nameLarkinGE Rinzler was also responsible for a lengthy profile and interview in the influential folk music magazine Sing Out that first publicly referred to Monroe as the father of bluegrass Accordingly at the first bluegrass festival organized by Carlton Haney at Roanoke Virginia in 1965 Bill Monroe was the central figureref nameLarkinGE

In 1964 before the Grateful Dead got together Jerry Garcia caravanned across the country from California to tag along with Monroerefref

The growing national popularity of Monroes music during the 1960s was also apparent in the increasingly diverse background of musicians recruited into his band Nonsoutherners who served as Blue Grass Boys during this period included banjo player Bill Keith musicianBill Keith and singerguitarist Peter Rowan from Massachusettsref nameLarkinGE fiddler Gene Lowinger from New Jersey banjo player Lamar Grier from Maryland banjo player Steve Arkin from New York and singerguitarist Roland White and fiddler Richard Greene musicianRichard Greene from California

Later years
 He founded the Hall in 1984
Even after the folk revival faded in the mid1960s it left a loyal audience for bluegrass music Bluegrass festivals became common with fans often traveling long distances to see a number of different acts over several days of performances

In 1967 Monroe himself founded an annual bluegrass festival at Beanblossom IndianaBean Blossom in southern Indiana a park he had purchased in 1951ref nameLarkinGE which routinely attracted a crowd of thousands a double LP from the festival featuring Monroe Jimmy Martin Lester Flatt and Jim and Jesse was released in 1973 The annual Bill Monroe Bean Blossom Bluegrass Festival is now the worlds oldest continuously running annual bluegrass festivalrefref

Monroes compositions during his later period were largely instrumentals including Jerusalem Ridge Old Dangerfield originally spelled Daingerfield after Daingerfield Texasthe town in East TexasrefStoney Lonesome Fiddle Book by Stacy Phillipsref and My Last Days on Earth he settled into a new role as a musical patriarch who continued to influence younger generations of musicians Monroe recorded two albums of duets in the 1980s the first featured collaborations with country stars such as Emmylou Harris Waylon Jennings and The Oak Ridge Boys while the second paired him with other prominent bluegrass musiciansref nameLarkinGE A 1989 live album celebrated his 50th year on the Grand Ole Opryref nameLarkinGE Monroe also kept a hectic touring scheduleref nameLarkinGE On April 7 1990 Monroe performed for Farm AidFarm Aid IV in Indianapolis Indiana along with Willie Nelson John Mellencamp Neil Young and with many other artistsrefref

 Death 
Monroes last performance occurred on March 15 1996 He ended his touring and playing career in April following a stroke Monroe died on September 9 1996 in Springfield Tennessee four days before his 85th birthdayref nameFlipporefrefref

 Legacy and influence 

According to Ralph Rinzler Bill Monroe impacted music in the following five waysrefref

 When others were going electric Bill created a space for an acoustic string band tradition to continue to grow and develop within country music
 He developed a distinct vocal tradition  the high lonesome sound
 He established the mandolin as a virtuoso string band instrument
 He composed a diverse repertoire of songs and instrumental tunes which have become standard fare among bluegrass country and some pop musicians
 More than any other musician of his time he skillfully infused country music with archaic tonal subtlety including AngloScotsIrish and Blues influences

Artists that claimed to be influenced by or to be playing the bluegrass genre were often bullied by Bill Monroe He always considered himself the father and caretaker of bluegrass He would often say of new bands that did not perform to his standards That aint no part of nothin Even those who question the scope of bluegrass refer to Monroe as a musical giant and recognize that there would be no bluegrass without Bill Monroerefref

More than 150 musicians played in the Blue Grass Boys over the nearly 60 years of Monroes performing career Monroe tended to recruit promising young musicians who served an apprenticeship with him before becoming accomplished artists in their own right Some of Monroes band members who went on to greater prominence include singerguitarists Clyde Moody Lester Flatt Jack Cook Mac Wiseman Jimmy Martin Carter Stanley Del McCoury Peter Rowan Roland White Roland Dunn and Riders in the Sky bandDoug Green banjo players Earl Scruggs Bob Black Butch Robins Buck Trent Don Reno David Stringbean AkemanStringbean Osborne BrothersSonny Osborne and Bill Keith musicianBill Keith and fiddlers Tommy Magness Chubby Wise Vassar Clements Byron Berline Kenny Baker fiddlerKenny Baker Bobby Hicks Gordon Terry Randall Franks and Glen Duncan Monroe also regularly performed with flatpicking guitar virtuoso Doc Watson

Modern bluegrass singer and mandolin player Ricky Skaggs was influenced by Monroe Skaggs was only six years old in 1960 when he first got to perform on stage with Monroe and his band at the high school in Martha Kentucky He stated I think Bill Monroes importance to American music is as important as someone like Robert Johnson was to blues or Louis Armstrong He was so influential I think hes probably the only musician that had a whole style of music named after his bandref nameMusicref

In 1999 the portion of Indiana State Road 135 running from Morgantown IndianaMorgantown through to Nashville Indiana was dedicated to Bill Monroe and is known as the Bill Monroe Memorial Highwayrefref

Development

Scruggs is noted for popularizing a threefinger banjopicking style now called Scruggs style that has become a defining characteristic of bluegrass musicref nametrishkaref Prior to Scruggs most banjo players used the clawhammerfrailing or clawhammer technique which consists of holding the fingers bent like a claw and moving the entire hand in a downward motion so that the strings are struck with the back of the middle fingernail This motion is followed by striking the thumb on a single stringref nameclawhammervideoref The threefinger style of playing is radically different from frailing the hand remains stationary and only the fingers and thumb move somewhat similar to classical guitar techniqueref namebrownpaul  Scruggs style also involves using Fingerpickpicks on three digits see photo each plucking individual stringsdownward with the thumb then upward with the index and middle finger in sequence When done skillfully and in rapid sequence the style allows any digit though usually the thumb to play a melody while the other two digits play arpeggios of the melody line The use of picks gives each note a louder percussive attack creating an exciting effect described by The New York Times as like thumbtacks plinking rhythmically on a tin roofref namenytimesref This departure from traditional playing elevated the banjo to become more of a solo instrumenta promotion from its former role of providing background rhythm or serving as a comedians propand popularized the instrument in several genres of musicref nameassociatedrefref nametelegraphrefref nameinstructionbookref

Earl Scruggs did not invent threefinger banjo playing in fact he said the threefinger style was the most common way to play the fivestring banjo in his hometown in western North Carolinaref namebrownpaul  An early influence was a local banjoist Snuffy JenkinsDeWitt Snuffy Jenkins who plucked in a finger style According to banjoist and historian Tony Trischka Jenkins came about as close as one could to Scruggs style without actually playing itref nametrishka  At age ten when Scruggs first learned the technique he recalled that he was at home in his room after a quarrel with his brother He was idly playing a song called Reuben and suddenly realized that he was playing with three fingers not two That excited me to no end he later recalled and said he ran through the house repeatedly yelling Ive got itref namebrownpaul ref namewebsitebio  From there he devoted all his free time to perfecting his timing and to adding syncopation and variations to it Controversy exists as to the actual origin of threefinger picking stylerefref Don Reno an eminent banjo player who also played this style and who knew Scruggs at that young age described Scruggs early playing as similar to that of Snuffy Jenkinsref namewillis  Scruggs however consistently referred to it as his own saying that he adapted to it a syncopated roll that was quite differentref namewillis ref namebaderbrianref On the subject John Hartford said Heres the way I feel about it Everybodys all worried about who invented the style and its obvious that three finger banjo pickers have been around a long timemaybe since 1840 But its my feeling that if it wasnt for Earl Scruggs you wouldnt be worried about who invented itref namewillis 

With Bill Monroe and the Blue Grass Boys
At age 15 Scruggs played in a group called The Morris Brothers for a few months but quit to work in a factory making sewing thread in the Lily Textile Mill near his home in North Carolinaref namecooperbookref He worked there about two years earning 40 cents an hour until the draft restriction for World War II was lifted in 1945 at which time he returned to music performing with Lost John Miller and his Allied Kentuckians on WNOX in Knoxvilleref namewillis  About this time an opening to play with Bill Monroe became available

When Scruggs was 21 Monroe was looking for a banjo player for his group because David Stringbean Akeman was quitting At the time banjo players often functioned in the band as comedians and the instrument was often held as a proptheir clawhammer playing was almost inaudibleref namewashingtonref Monroe along with band member Lester Flatt auditioned several banjo players who had the same traditional playing style as Akeman When Scruggs auditioned for them at the Tulane Hotel in Nashville Flatt said I was thrilled It was so different I had never heard that kind of banjo pickingref namewillis ref nametulaneref Scruggs joined Monroe in late 1945 earning 50 a weekref namenytimes  After they accepted Scruggs as one of the Blue Grass Boys the roster consisted of Bill Monroe vocalsmandolin Lester Flatt guitarvocals Earl Scruggs banjo Chubby Wise fiddle and Howard Watts stage name Cedric Rainwater on bass This group of men became the prototype of what a bluegrass band would becomeref namecooperref

With Monroe and Lester Flatt Scruggs performed on the Grand Ole Opry and in September 1946 recorded the classic hit Blue Moon of Kentucky a song that was designated by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry and later added to the Grammy Hall of Fame The work schedule was heavy in Monroes band They were playing a lot of jobs in movie theaters all over the south riding in a 1941 Chevrolet from town to town doing up to six shows a day and not finishing up until about eleven at night Lester Flatt said It wasnt anything to ride two or three days in a car We didnt have buses like we do now and we never had our shoes offref namewillis  The selfimposed rule was to always get back in time to play the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville each Saturday nightref namefreshairref Scruggs said of Monroe that Bill would never let the music go down no matter how tired we were If a man would slack off he would move over and get that mandolin up close on him and get him back up thereref namewillis  Despite the groups success Scruggs decided the demands were too great He was single at the time and the brief few hours on Saturdays that he made it home it was just to pack his suitcase at the Tulane Hotel where he lived alone then repeat the cyclehe had done this for two yearsref namefreshair  He turned in his resignation planning to go take care of his mother in North Carolina Flatt had also made up his mind to leave but he had not told anyone He later gave his twoweek notice but before the notice was up the bass player Howard Watts announced that he was leaving too Despite Monroes pleading they left the band Monroe thought Flatt and Scruggs had a secret understanding but both men denied it Monroe did not speak to either one for 20 years thereafter a feud well known in country music circlesref namenytimes 

Flatt and Scruggs
In 1948 Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs formed the duo Flatt and Scruggs and chose the name the Foggy Mountain Boys for their backing band The name came from a song by the Carter Family called Foggy Mountain Top that the band used as a theme song at the timeref namenytimes ref namefellowship  Flatt later acknowledged that they consciously tried to make their sound different from Monroes group In the spring of 1949 their second Mercury recording session yielded the classic Foggy Mountain Breakdown released on 78 RPM phonograph records that were in use at the timeref name78rpmyaleref In the mid1950s they dropped the mandolin and added a Dobro played by Josh GravesBuck Uncle Josh Graves  Previously Scruggs had performed something similar called Bluegrass Breakdown with Bill Monroe but Monroe had denied him songwriting credit for it Later Scruggs changed the song adding a minor chord thus creating Foggy Mountain Breakdownref namenewyorkerref The song contains a musical oddity Flatt plays an E major chord against Scruggss E minor When asked about the dissonance years later Scruggs said he had tried to get Flatt to consistently play a minor there to no avail he said he eventually became used to the sound and even fond of itref nameeminorref The song won a Grammy and became an anthem for many banjo players to attempt to masterref namebrownpaul The band routinely tuned its instruments a halfstep higher than standard tuning in those days to get more brightness or pop to the sound returning to standard pitch in the 1960sref namesemitonetworef

In October 1951 the band recorded Earls Breakdown which featured a technique where Scruggs would manually detune the second and third stringsrefref of the banjo during a song using a cam device he had made to attach to the instrument giving the surprise effect of a downward string bend He and his brother Horace had experimented with it when they were growing upref namewillis  Scruggs had drilled some holes in the peghead of his banjo to install the device and chipped the pearl inlay He covered the holes with a piece of metal which can be seen on the album cover of Foggy Mountain Jamboree The technique became popular and led to improvement of the design without drilling holes by Bill Keith who then manufactured Beacon Banjo CompanyScruggsKeith Tunersref namekeithtunersrefref namebeaconref The original tuners Scruggs made and used are now in a museum display at the Earl Scruggs Center in Shelby North Carolinaref namegoadjohnref

Biography

Clements was born in Kinard Floridaref nameLarkinCountryref and grew up in Kissimmee FloridaKissimmee He taught himself to play the fiddle at age 7 learning Theres an Old Spinning Wheel in the Parlor as his first song Soon he joined with two first cousins Red and Gerald to form a local string band In his early teens Clements met Bill Monroe and the Blue Grass Boys when they came to Florida to visit Clements stepfather a friend of fiddler Chubby Wise Clements was impressed with his playing

In late 1949 Wise left Monroes group and the 21 yearold Clements traveled by bus to ask for an audition When told he would have to return the next day Clements was crestfallen lacking the money for either a hotel room or return bus trip Monroe gave him some money to a nights lodging and the next day Clements auditioned and was hired He remained with Monroe for seven years recording with the band in 1950 and 1951ref nameLarkinCountry

Between 1957 and 1962 he was a member of the bluegrass musicbluegrass band Jim and Jesse  the Virginia Boysref nameLarkinCountry  He also gained recognition joining with the popular bluegrass duo of Flatt and Scruggs on the popular theme to the hit television sitcom The Beverly Hillbillies Earl Scruggs pathbreaking banjo style had premiered with Bill Monroe in the late 1940s and thereafter gained widespread renown with Lester Flatt and the Foggy Mountain Boys

By the mid1960s however his struggles with alcohol left him making his living in Bluecollar workerbluecollar trades being employed briefly at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida as a plumber in a Georgia US stateGeorgia paper mill and as switchman for Atlantic Coast Line Railroad  He even sold insurance and once operated a convenience store while owning a potato chip franchisingfranchise in Huntsville Alabama Sobering up he returned to Nashville TennesseeNashville in 1967 where he became a much soughtafter studio musician

After a brief touring stint with Faron Young he joined John Hartfords Dobrolic Plectral Society in 1971ref nameLarkinCountry when he met guitarist Norman Blake American musicianNorman Blake and Dobro player Tut Taylor and recorded AereoPlain a widely acclaimed newgrass album that helped broaden the bluegrass market and sound After less than a year he joined up with Earl Scruggsref nameLarkinCountry

His 1972 work with the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band on their album Will the Circle be Unbroken Nitty Gritty Dirt Band albumWill the Circle be Unbroken earned even wider acclaim and he later worked on the Grateful Deads Wake of the Flood and Jimmy Buffetts A White Sport Coat and a Pink Crustaceanref nameLarkinCountry Within the next two years Clements would cut his first solo album

In 1973 he joined and toured with the bluegrass supergroup Old  In the Way with Jerry Garciaref nameLarkinCountry David Grisman Peter Rowan and John Kahn their selftitled live album Old  In the Way albumOld  In the Way was released in 1975

In 1974 he lent his talents to Highway Call a solo album by former Allman Brothers Band guitarist Dickey Betts
He was considered by many to be an outstanding fiddle virtuoso and he described his talent saying 

In his 50year career he played with artists ranging from Woody Herman and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band to the Grateful Dead Linda Ronstadt and Paul McCartney and earned at least five Grammy Award nominations and numerous professional accolades He once recorded with the pop group the Monkees by happenstance when he stayed behind after an earlier recording session He also appeared in Robert Altmans 1975 film Nashville filmNashvilleref nameLarkinCountry and Alan Rudolphs 1976 film Welcome to LA He made a duet album with Stéphane Grappelli Together at Last in 1987

In 2004 he performed in concert with jazz quartet Third Stream  in which a video documentary of the concert was done with Jim Easton guitar Tom Strohman sax Jim Miller bass and John Peifer drumsrefref

Though he played numerous instruments Clements indicated that he chose the fiddle over guitar recalling that I picked up a guitar and fiddle and tried them both out The guitar was pretty easy but I couldnt get nothing out of the fiddle So every time Id see those instruments sitting side by side Id grab that fiddle

Big band and swing music were considerable influences upon his style and musical development and he said that Bands like Glenn Miller Les Brown bandleaderLes Brown Tommy Dorsey Harry James and Artie Shaw were very popular when I was a kid I always loved rhythm so I guess in the back of my mind the swing and jazz subconsciously comes out when I play because when I was learning I was always trying to emulate the bigband sounds I heard on my fiddle

Vassar Clements played on over 200 albums including nearly 40 on which he starred or was featured His albums often featured newgrass style music and what Clements called Hillbilly Jazz His last album Livin With the Blues released in 2004 was his only blues recording it featured guest appearances by Elvin Bishop Norton Buffalo Maria Muldaur and others

The Louvin Brothers were an American musical duo composed of brothers Ira LouvinIra and Charlie Louvin né Loudermilk The brothers are cousins to John D Loudermilk a Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame member

The brothers wrote and performed country musiccountry Bluegrass musicbluegrass and gospel music Ira played mandolin and generally sang lead vocal in the tenor range while Charlie played rhythm guitar and offered supporting vocals in a lower pitch They helped popularize the vocal technique of close harmony in country and countryrockref nameCSTref
 
After becoming regulars at the Grand Ole Opry and scoring a string of hit singles in the late 1950s and early 60s the Louvin Brothers broke up in 1963 due in large part to Charlie growing tired of Iras addictions and reckless behavior Ira died in a traffic accident in 1965 They were inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2001 and Charlie died of cancer in 2011 Rolling Stone ranked the Louvin Brothers number four on its list of the 20 Greatest Duos of All Timerefref

Background
Brothers Ira LouvinIra April 21 1924  June 20 1965 and Charlie LouvinCharlie July 7 1927  January 26 2011 Louvin né Loudermilk adopted the name Louvin Brothers in the 1940s as they began their career in gospel music They grew up listening to and singing shape note music which influenced the rest of their musical outputrefref Their first foray into secular music was the minor hit The Get Acquainted Waltz recorded with Chet Atkins Their other hits include Cash on the Barrelhead and When I Stop Dreaming They joined the Grand Ole Opry in 1955 and stayed there until breaking up in 1963ref name  Wolferef

Their songs were heavily influenced by their Baptist faith and warned against sin   Nevertheless Ira Louvin was notorious for his drinking womanizing and volcanic temperref nameDimeryLydon2010 He was married four times his third wife Faye shot him four times in the chest and twice in the hand after he allegedly tried to strangle her with a telephone cordrefref Although seriously injured he survived  When performing and drinking Ira would sometimes become angry enough on stage to smash his mandolin when he was unable to tune it and  when sober  glue it back together His style was heavily influenced by Bill Monroe and his brother Charlie Monroe who had a tempestuous relationship with Ira considered him one of the top mandolin players in Nashvillerefref

In his The New York TimesNew York Times review of Charlies biography Satan Is Real Alex Abramovich said Ira Louvin was a full head taller than his younger brother played the mandolin like Bill Monroe and sang in an impossibly high tense quivering tenor Charlie strummed a guitar grinned like a vaudevillian and handled the bottom register But every so often in the middle of a song some hidden signal flashed and the brothers switched places  with Ira swooping down from the heights and Charlie angling upward  and even the most careful listeners would lose track of which man was carrying the lead This was more than closeharmony singing each instance was an act of transubstantiationrefref

In 1963 fed up with Iras drinking and abusive behavior Charlie started a solo careerref nameDimeryLydon2010 and Ira also went on his own

Ira died on June 20 1965 at the age of 41 His fourth wife Anne Young and he were on the way home from a performance in Kansas City when they came to a section of construction on Highway 70 outside of Williamsburg Missouri where traffic had been reduced down to one lane A drunken driver struck their car headon and both Ira and Anne were killed instantlyrefref At the time a warrant for Iras arrest had been issued on a DUI charge

Charlie died of pancreatic cancer on January 26 2011 at age 83

In 1954 when Clarence was ten the White family relocated to Burbank California and soon after Clarence joined his brothers Roland WhiteRoland and Eric Jr who played mandolin and banjo respectively in a trio called Three Little Country Boysref namehjort  Although they initially started out playing contemporary country music the group soon switched to a purely Bluegrass musicbluegrass repertoire as a result of Rolands burgeoning interest in the genreref nameKingsbury

In 1957 banjoist Billy Ray Latham and Dobro player LeRoy Mack were added to the lineupref nametimeless with the band renaming themselves the Country Boys soon afterref namehjort In 1961 the Country Boys also added Roger Bush on double bass as a replacement for Eric White Jrref namehjort  That same year Clarence and other members of the Country Boys appeared on two episodes of The Andy Griffith Showref namehjort  Between 1959 and 1962 the group released three Single musicsingles on the Sundown Republic and Briar International record labelsref namediscref

The Kentucky Colonels

Following the recording sessions for the Country Boys debut album the band changed its name to the Kentucky Colonels bandKentucky Colonels in September 1962 at the suggestion of country guitarist and friend Joe Maphisref namehjort  The bands album was released by Briar International under the title The New Sound of Bluegrass America in early 1963ref nametimeless2ref

Around this time Clarences flatpicking guitar style was becoming a much more prominent part of the groups musicref nameKingsbury  After attending a performance by Doc Watson at the Ash Grove music clubAsh Grove folk club in Los Angeles where he also met the guitarist Clarence began to explore the possibilities of the acoustic guitars role in bluegrass musicref nameKingsbury  At that time the guitar was largely regarded as a rhythm instrument in bluegrass with only a few performers such as  Watson exploring its potential for soloingref nameKingsbury  White soon began to integrate elements of Watsons playing styleincluding the use of open strings and syncopationinto his own flatpicking guitar techniqueref namebyrdwatcher  His breathtaking speed and virtuosity on the instrumentref nametimeless2 was largely responsible for making the guitar a lead instrument within bluegrassrefref

The Kentucky Colonels became well known on the bluegrass circuit during this period and made many live appearances throughout California and the United Statesref namehjort  Between bookings with the Colonels White also made a guest appearance on Eric Weissberg and Marshall Brickmans New Dimensions in Banjo  Bluegrass album which would be rereleased in 1973 as the soundtrack album to the film Deliverance with Weissberg and Steve Mandells version of Dueling Banjos added to the albums track listingref namebyrdwatcherreftitleDueling Banjos from the Original Soundtrack Deliverance album reviewlastJohnsonfirstZacwebsiteAllmusicpublisherRovi Corpaccessdate20130813ref

In 1964 the Colonels recruited fiddle player Bobby Sloan and continued to make live appearances at various clubs concert halls and festivalsref namehjort The Colonels second album Appalachian Swingref nametimeless2 was a commercial success and saw Whites flatpicking permanently expand the language of bluegrass guitarref namehjort2ref Music critic Thom Owens has remarked that Whites playing on the album helped pioneer a new style in bluegrass namely he redefined the acoustic guitar as a solo instrumentref nameallmusic2titleAppalachian Swing album reviewlastOwensfirstThomwebsiteAllmusicpublisherRovi Corpaccessdate20130813ref

Shortly after the recording of the Appalachian Swing album Roland and Clarence undertook some Session musiciansession work backing dobroist Tut Taylor on a Dobrothemed album that was released by World Pacific Records in late 1964 as Dobro Countryref namebyrdwatcher  Although the brothers were employed as session musicians the album was credited to Tut Taylor Roland and Clarence White upon releaseref namebyrdwatcher

Although the Colonels were a successful recording act it was becoming increasingly difficult for them to make a living due to the waning popularity of the American folk music revival due to the British Invasion and homegrown folk rock acts such as the Byrds and Bob Dylanref namebyrdwatcher  As a result the Colonels switched to electric instrumentationref namebyrdwatcher and hired a drummerrefref  In spite of these changes the Kentucky Colonels dissolved as a band following a show on October 31 1965ref nametimeless2  Clarence Roland and Eric Jr formed a new lineup of the Colonels in 1966 with several other musicians but this second version of the group was shortlived and by early 1967 they had broken upref namebyrdwatcher2ref

Session work 19661968
During 1964 White began to look beyond bluegrass music towards rock n roll as an avenue for artistic expressionref nametimeless  Although he was influenced by Country guitarists like Doc Watson Don Reno and Joe Maphis he also idolized the playing of jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt rock n roller Chuck Berry and studio musician James Burtonref namebyrdwatcher2  White even anticipated the viability of a folkrock hybrid when in the summer of 1964 he was approached by Jim Dickson to record a version of the thenunreleased Bob Dylan song Mr Tambourine Man with electric instrumentsref nametimeless  However despite Whites enthusiasm for the project he was unable to convince his bandmates in the Kentucky Colonels of the experiments validityref nametimeless and ultimately the song was instead recorded by Dicksons proteges the Byrdsrefref

By the time the original lineup of the Kentucky Colonels folded in late 1965 White had become a respected and wellknown guitaristref nametimeless  Abandoning bluegrass temporarily he switched from his Martin D28 acoustic guitar to an electric Fender Telecaster with the intention of becoming a studio musician like his hero James Burtonref namelightning  Transitioning to electric guitar required White to modify his right hand playing technique switch from open chording to fretting the whole Neck musicguitar neck with his left hand and practice using the tone and volume controlsref namelightning  However he soon mastered the intricacies of the instrument and between 1965 and 1968 he undertook session work for artists including Ricky Nelson the Monkees and the Vern GosdinGosdin Brothersref nametimelessref namebyrdwatcher2 
  
As 1965 turned into 1966 White met Gene Parsons and Gib Guilbeau at a recording session for the Gosdin Brothers and shortly after he began to perform live with the duo in local California clubs as well as doing regular session work on their records which were released under the moniker of Cajun Gib and Generef nameallmusicref namebyrdwatcher2  1966 also saw White begin playing with a country group called Trio which featured drummer Bart Haney and former Kentucky Colonel Roger Bush on bassref namebyrdwatcher2  In autumn of that year as a result of his friendship with Gilbeau Parsons and the Gosdin Brothers White was asked to provide lead guitar to exByrd Gene Clarks debut solo album Gene Clark with the Gosdin Brothersref nameallmusicrefref  White briefly joined Clarks touring band shortly thereafterrefref

During the Clark album sessions White reconnected with mandolin player and bassist Chris Hillman who he had known during the early 1960s as a member of the bluegrass combo the Hillmenref namehjort3ref  Hillman was currently a member of the Byrds and in December 1966 he invited White to contribute countrified lead guitar playing to his songs Time Between and The Girl with No Name which both appeared on the Byrds Younger Than Yesterday albumref namehjort3  The countryoriented nature of the songs was something of a stylistic departure for the group and can be seen as an early indicator of the experimentation with country music that would color the Byrds subsequent workrefref  White also contributed guitar to the bands followup album The Notorious Byrd Brothersrefref and to their seminal 1968 country rock release Sweetheart of the Rodeoref nameallmusic3ref

Nashville West

The StringBender

During 1967 while they were both members of Nashville West White and Parsons invented a device that enabled Clarence to simulate the sound of a pedal steel guitar on his 1954 Fender Telecasterref namebyrdwatcher3ref  The need for such a device was driven by Whites desire to bend his guitars Strings musicBstring up a full Major secondtone while keeping his left hand on the strings and Fingerboardfretboardref namehjort5ref  In order to achieve this feat White felt that he needed a third handref namebyrdwatcher3  The guitarist turned to his friend Parsons who was an amateur machinist and asked him to design and build an apparatus to pull or drop the Bstringref namebyrdwatcher3

The device which was known as the ParsonsWhite StringBender also known as the BBender was a springlever mechanism built into the inside of Whites guitar which linked to the guitars strap button and the Bstringref nameKingsburyref namehjort5  When it was activated by pulling down on the guitar neck it pulled on the Bstring and caused the guitar to simulate the crying sound of a pedal steelref nameKingsbury  White would go on to use the device extensively as a member of the Byrds and as a result the distinctive sound of the StringBender would become a defining characteristic of that bands music during Whites tenure with the grouprefref

Death

Musical influence
Clarence White helped popularize the acoustic guitar as a lead instrument in bluegrass music building on the work of guitarists such as Doc Watson Prior to the advent of the more aggressive flatpicking style pioneered by guitarists like Watson and White the guitar was strictly a rhythm instrument save for a few exceptions such as the occasional guitar track by banjoist Don Reno Many of the most influential flatpickers of the 20th century cite White as a primary influence including Dan Crary Norman Blake American musicianNorman Blake and Tony Rice  Rice owned and played Whites highly modified 1935 CF Martin  CompanyMartin D28 David Grier and Russ Barenberg are two other acoustic guitarists who were heavily influenced by Whites guitar work  Whites bluegrass playing with the Kentucky Colonels was also a considerable influence on Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Deadref namelightning who traveled with the band during 1964refref

On the electric side of the guitar spectrum White was similarly influential Together with fellow Byrds bandmember Gene Parsons White invented the BBender device This device raises the Bstring second string of the guitar a whole step by the use of pulleys and levers attached to both the upper strap knob and the second string on the guitar It is activated by pushing down on the neck and produces a pedal steel type sound Arlen Roth heavily influenced by this style did not at the time know that White and Parsons had invented a Bbender so instead developed his own unique allfinger bending version of this technique This was heavily documented in his groundbreaking book Nashville Guitar all of his recordings as well as his book Masters of the Telecaster Subsequently his Telecaster sound became as notable as his bluegrass playing Marty Stuart another guitarist influenced by Whites playing now owns and regularly plays Whites 1954 Fender Telecaster with the prototype BBenderrefhttpwwwmartystuartcomZArtGuitarPlayer894htm Gill Chris Steel And Wood Heart And Soul  The Marty Stuart Guitar Collection reprinted from Guitar Player Magazine August 1994ref

Music archivist and writer Alec Palao has called White one of a handful of true greats amongst the instrumentalists of 20th century popular music before adding that the waves created by the guitarists idiosyncratic style are still forming ripples within bluegrass country and rock n rollrefref  In 2003 White was ranked Nonbsp41 on Rolling Stone magazines list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time In 2010 guitar manufacturer Gibson Guitar CorporationGibson ranked White at Nonbsp42 on their Top 50 Guitarists of All Time listrefref

The Chuck Wagon Gang is a Country gospel musical group formed in 1935 by David P Dad Carter oldest son Ernest Jim along with daughters Lola Rose and Effie AnnarefBob Terrell The Chuck Wagon Gang A Legend Lives On 1990ref The group got their first radio break as sponsored singers for Bewley Flour in 1936refRick Marsehall Encyclopedia of Country and Western Music 1990 Page 33 Soon thereafter Bewley Flour lost their sponsored singers on the station the Chuck Wagon Gang and the Carters were asked to assume the role The year was 1936 ref The Gang signed with Columbia Records and remained with them for 39 years a world record that lasted until 2000 when Johnny Mathis overall time with the same label combining his signing in 1957 and resigning in 1968 entered its 40th year At one point they were Columbias number one group with over 39 million in record salesref nametitleThe Renaissance Center  Home  News  Chuck Wagon Gang 2003The Chuck Wagon Gangs Startref

The Chuck Wagon Gang has performed at Carnegie Hall the Hollywood Bowl and the Grand Ole Opry The group has been inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame and the Smithsonian Institutions classic American recordingsref nametitleThe Renaissance Center  Home  News  Chuck Wagon Gang 2003

1930s to 1970s 
The group was founded in 1935 broadcasting from radio station KFYO AMKFYO in Lubbock Texas and took the name in 1936 when they moved to WBAP AMWBAP in Fort Worthrefref  The original members sang together all the way to 1955 when Dad Carter retired later passing away in 1963 followed by Jim in 1971  Sons Eddie and Roy Carter stepped in to sing tenor and bass respectively which began the tradition of Carter siblings children and eventually grandchildren joining the Gang

By the mid1970s the group was still touring parttime but felt a lack of support from the label they had recorded for during the previous three decades  Columbia had stopped servicing their songs to radio thus airplay had become nonexistent The decision was eventually made to move on from Columbia in the interest of rebuilding the group to a position akin to what it had enjoyed in years past To that end in 1979 they began recording for Copperfield Records and remained with that label for several years refBob Terrell The Chuck Wagon Gang A Legend Lives On 1990ref

1980s to Present Day
After its relationship with Copperfield Records ended the Chuck Wagon Gang began recording for Associated Artists  It was during this era that the group took advantage of its renewed popularity and in keeping with the gospel sounds of the time added a piano player to the lineup for live concerts  Fans responded positively to this sound eventually culminating in the Gang receiving the Best Gospel Group in Country Music award at the Music City News Awards in 1988 refBob Terrell The Chuck Wagon Gang A Legend Lives On 1990ref

Roy approached Annas granddaughter Shaye in 1993 asking her to assume the responsibility of singing soprano upon the retirement of member Debbie Trusty  Shaye accepted Roys offer and sang soprano with the Gang until the retirement of alto singer Ruth Ellen Carter Yates a few years later when she moved to her current position of alto singer   Roy subsequently retired bringing about a new era for the Gang in which none of Dad Carters children were members  As the 21st century dawned the Gang sought to return to its origins paring its sound back to the beautiful simplicity of fourpart harmony accompanied by a single guitar  Once again fans responded positively  As of 2024 the Gang records for Crossroads Label Group Source

Members backgrounds
Each of the band members had a job during the week Duffey repaired musical instruments Eldridge was a mathematician Starling a physicianref nameenc  Auldridge a graphic artist and Gray a cartographer with National Geographic MagazineNational Geographicref namerosenberg  They agreed to play one night a week at local clubs perform occasionally at concerts and festivals on weekends and make records After playing for six weeks at a small Washington DC club called the Rabbits Foot the group found a home at the Red Fox Inn in Bethesda Marylandref nameCountry Music Encyclopedia They performed at that venue Friday nights from January 1972 through September 1977 before starting weekly performances at the Birchmere music hallref nameIBMA Scene at Red Foxref

Rise to popularity 19721976
The progressive bluegrass style played by the Seldom Scene had become increasingly popular during the 1970s especially Duffeys high tenor and the vocal blend of DuffeyStarlingAuldridgeref nameenc  Their weekly shows included bluegrass versions of country music rock and even classical popref nameenc  The bands popularity soon forced them to play more than once a weekref nameenc  but they continued to maintain their image as being seldom seen and on several of their early album covers were photographed with the stage lights on only their feet or with their backs to the camera Though the Scene remained a nontouring band they were prolific recorders producing seven albums in their first five years of existence including one live album among the first live bluegrass albumsref nameAllmusic Scene discographyref

John Starlings departure and Phil Rosenthal as lead singer 19771986
In 1977 John Starling left the group to focus on his medical career and was replaced by singer and songwriter Phil Rosenthal whose song Muddy Water had been recorded by the Scene on two earlier albums Starling and Rosenthal shared their lead vocals on the groups sixth studio album Baptizing albumBaptizing recorded in 1978 Around the same time the group switched record labels from Rebel RecordsRebel to Sugar Hill Records bluegrass labelSugar Hill Starling recorded a solo album for Sugar Hill in 1980 called Long Time Gone and another in 1982 called Waitin On a Southern Train on both of which Mike Auldridge played

The lineup of RosenthalDuffeyGrayAuldridgeEldridge recorded five albums of a comparable popularity to the ones with the founding members including John Starling Rosenthal proved to be as good lead singer as Starling and his baritone voice contrasted well with Duffeys high tenor extravaganzas He also wrote typically two to three songs on each of the albums and also added acoustic guitar solos to the groupref Album  AllMusic urlhttpswwwallmusiccomalbumactfourmw0000646266 accessdate20240711 languageen archivedate20231104 archiveurlhttpswebarchiveorgweb20231104151257httpswwwallmusiccomalbumactfourmw0000646266 urlstatuslive ref

More changes in lineup 19861996
In 1986 Phil Rosenthal and Tom Gray both left the band to focus on other pursuits and were replaced by Lou Reid and T Michael Coleman respectively Coleman proved to be very controversial as many purists objected to his use of an electric bass in what is nominally an acoustic genre but the albums produced by the band after Colemans arrival maintained the traditional appeal of any of the Scenes earlier albums

Reid left the band in 1992 and Duffey convinced former member John Starling to return to the band for the next yearref nameallbookref During that year the Scene recorded the album Like We Used to Be albumLike We Used to Be but Starling did not wish to stay with the band long term He was replaced in 1994 by lead singer Moondi Kleinref nameenc 

Throughout these changes band leader John Duffeys original plan of keeping a light touring schedule and staying close to home continued to prevail During 1995 and 1996 Klein and Coleman along with original member Mike Auldridge wanting to be part of a fulltime project left the Seldom Scene to form a new band called Chesapeake bandChesapeakeref nameallbook  For a time the Scene stopped recording
