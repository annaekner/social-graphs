In 1973 Twitty released Youve Never Been This Far Before which was number 1 in country for three weeks that September and also reached number 22 on the pop charts Some more conservative disc jockeys refused to play the song believing that some of the lyrics were too sexually suggestive

Harriet normally the vocalist for Ozzies band remained in Englewood New Jersey with her newborn and toddler Meanwhile bandleader Ozzie toured with the Nelson orchestra The Nelsons bought a twostory colonial house in Tenafly New Jerseyref nameCotten  and six months after the purchase moved with son David to Hollywood where Ozzie and Harriet were slated to appear in the 194142 season of Red Skeltons The Raleigh Cigarette Hour Ricky remained in Tenafly in the care of his paternal grandmother In November 1941 the Nelsons bought what would become their permanent home a green and white twostory Cape Cod colonial home at 1822nbspCamino Palmero in Los Angeles Ricky joined his parents and brother there in 1942

Ricky was a small and insecure child who suffered from severe asthma At night his sleep was eased with a vaporizer emitting tincture of evergreen He was described by Red Skeltons producer John Guedel as an odd little kid likable shy introspective mysterious and inscrutable When Skelton was drafted in 1944 Guedel crafted the radio sitcom The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet for Rickys parents The show debuted on Sunday October 8 1944 to favorable reviews Ozzie eventually became head writer for the show and based episodes on the fraternal exploits and enmity of his sons The Nelson boys were first played in the radio series by professional child actors until twelveyearold Dave and eightyearold Ricky joined the show on February 20 1949 in the episode Invitation to Dinner


In 1952 the Nelsons tested the waters for a television series with the theatrically released film Here Come the Nelsons The film was a hit and Ozzie was convinced the family could make the transition from radios airwaves to televisions small screen On October 3 1952 The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet made its television debut and was broadcast in first run until September 3 1966 to become one of the longest running sitcoms in television history

Education
Nelson attended Gardner Street Public School Bancroft Junior High and between 1954 and 1958 Hollywood High School from which he graduated with a B average He played American footballfootball at Hollywood High and represented the school in interscholastic tennis matches Twentyfive years later Nelson told the Los Angeles Weekly he hated school because it smelled of pencils and he was forced to rise early in the morning to attend In January 1960 the athletic Nelson brothers formed a trapeze act with stunts in the 1271960 episode of Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet titled THE CIRCUSrefref

Ozzie Nelson was a Rutgers UniversityRutgers alumnus and keen on college education but eighteenyearold Ricky was already in the 93nbsppercent incometax bracket and saw no reason to attend At age thirteen Ricky was making over 100000 per annum and at sixteen he had a personal fortune of 500000 

Nelsons wealth was astutely managed by his parents who channeled his earnings into trust funds Although his parents permitted him a 50 allowance at the age of eighteen Ricky was often strapped for cash and one evening collected and redeemed empty pop bottles to gain entrance to a movie theater for himself and a date

Music career

Debut
Nelson played clarinet and drums in his tween demographictweens and early teens learned the rudimentary guitar chords and vocally imitated his favorite Sun Records rockabilly artists in the bathroom at home or in the showers at the Los Angeles Tennis Club He was strongly influenced by the music of Carl Perkins and once said he tried to emulate the sound and the tone of the guitar break in Perkinss March 1956 Top 40Top Ten hit Blue Suede Shoes

At age sixteen he wanted to impress his girlfriend of two years Diana Osborne who was an Elvis fan and although he had no record contract at the time told her that he too was going to make a record With his fathers help he secured a onerecord deal with Verve Records an important jazz label looking for a young and popular personality who could sing or be taught to sing On March 26 1957 he recorded the Fats Domino standard Im Walkin and A Teenagers Romance released in late April 1957 as his first singleref namepc11  and Youre My One and Only Love

Before the single was released he made his television rockandroll debut on April 10 1957 singing and playing the drums to Im Walkin in the Ozzie and Harriet episode Ricky the Drummer About the same time he made an unpaid public appearance singing Blue Moon of Kentucky with The Four Preps at a Hamilton High School lunchhour assemblyref namepc11  in Los Angeles and was greeted by hordes of screaming teens who had seen the television episode

Im Walkin reached No 4 on Billboard magazineBillboards Best Sellers in Stores chart and its flip side A Teenagers Romance hit 2 When the television series went on summer break in 1957 Nelson made his first road trip and played four state and county fairs in Ohio and Wisconsin with the Four Preps who opened and closed for him

First album band and 1 single
In early summer 1957 Ozzie Nelson pulled his son from Verve after disputes about royalties and signed him to a lucrative fiveyear deal with Imperial Records that gave him approval over song selection sleeve artwork and other production details Rickys first Imperial single BeBop Baby generated 750000 advance orders sold over one million copies and reached No 3 on the charts Nelsons first album Ricky was released in October 1957 and hit 1 before the end of the year Following these successes Nelson was given a more prominent role on the Ozzie and Harriet show and ended every two or three episodes with a musical number

Nelson grew increasingly dissatisfied performing with older jazz and country session musicians who were openly contemptuous of rock and roll After his Ohio and Minnesota tours in the summer of 1957 he decided to form his own band with members closer to his age Eighteenyearold electric guitarist James Burton was the first signed Bassist James Kirkland drummer Richie Frost and pianist Gene Garf completed the band Their first recording together was Believe What You Say Prior to this Joe Maphis had been playing the lead guitar part and played lead on his first hits BeBop Baby Stood Up and Waitin In School

In 1958 Nelson recorded 17yearold Sharon Sheeleys Poor Little Fool for his second album Ricky Nelson released in June 1958 Radio airplay brought the tune notice and Imperial suggested releasing a single but Nelson opposed the idea believing a single would diminish EP sales When a single was released nonetheless he exercised his contractual right to approve any artwork and vetoed a picture sleeve On August 4 1958 Poor Little Fool became the 1 single on Billboards newly instituted Hot 100 singles chart and sold over two million copies

Nelson stated



During 1958 and 1959 Nelson had twelve hits in the charts in comparison with Elvis PresleyElvis Presleys eleven During these two years Presley had recorded music only for the movie King Creole in January and February 1958 before his induction into the US Armed Forces and a brief recording session consisting of five songs while on Leave militarymilitary leave four months later In the summer of 1958 Nelson conducted his first fullscale tour averaging 5000 nightly By 1960 the Ricky Nelson International Fan Club had 9000 chapters around the world


Nelson was the first teen idol to use television to promote hit records Ozzie Nelson even had the idea to edit footage together to create some of the first music videos This creative editing can be seen in videos Ozzie produced for Travelin Man Nelson appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1967 but his career by that time was in limbo He also appeared on other television shows usually in acting roles In 1973 he had an acting role in an episode of The Streets of San Francisco He starred in the episode A Hand For Sonny Blue from the 1977 series Quinn Martins Tales of the Unexpected known in the United Kingdom as Twist in the Tale In 1979 he guesthosted on Saturday Night Live spoofing his television sitcom image by appearing in a The Twilight Zone 1959 TV seriesTwilight Zone sendup in which always trying to go home he finds himself among the characters from other 1950searly 1960sera sitcoms Leave It to Beaver Father Knows Best Make Room for Daddy and I Love Lucy

Nelson knew and loved music and was a skilled performer even before he became a teen idol largely because of his parents musical background Nelson worked with many musicians of repute including James Burton Joe Osborn and Allen Puddler Harris all natives of Louisiana and Joe Maphis The Jordanaires Scotty Moore and Johnny BurnetteJohnny and Dorsey Burnette

Nelsons music was very well recorded with a clear punchy soundthanks in part to engineer Bunny Robyn and producer Jimmy Haskellref nameTech 

From 1957 to 1962 Nelson had 30 Top40 hits more than any other artist except Presley who had 53 and Pat Boone 38 Many of Nelsons early records were double hits with both the A and B sides hitting the Billboard magazineBillboard charts

While Nelson preferred rockabilly and uptempo rock songs like Believe What You Say Hot 100 4 I Got a Feeling Ricky Nelson songI Got a Feeling 10 My Buckets Got a Hole in It 12 Hello Mary Lou 9 Its Late 9 Stood Up songStood Up 2 Waitin In School songWaitin in School 18 BeBop Baby 3 and Just a Little Too Much 9 his smooth calm voice made him a natural to sing ballads He had major success with Travelin Man 1 A Teenagers Romance 2 Poor Little Fool 1 Young World songYoung World 5 Lonesome Town 7 Never Be Anyone Else But You 6 Sweeter Than You 9 Its Up to You Ricky Nelson songIts Up to You 6 and Teen Age Idol 5 which clearly could have been about Nelson himself

Film actor



In addition to his recording career Nelson appeared in movies He made his film debut in Here Come the Nelsons 1952 and had a small role in The Story of Three Loves 1953 at MGM directed by Vincente Minnelli playing Farley Granger as a boy

Following his success on TV and with singing Howard Hawks cast him as a gunslinger in Rio Bravo movieRio Bravo 1959 with John Wayne and Dean Martin Hawks attributed much of the films box office success to Nelson

Nelson costarred with Jack Lemmon in The Wackiest Ship in the Army filmThe Wackiest Ship in the Army 1960 which was popular enough to give rise to a TV series in which Nelson did not appear He guest starred on General Electric Theatre The Wish Book and starred in a romantic comedy feature written and directed by his father Love and Kisses 1965 movieLove and Kisses 1965 with Jack Kelly actorJack Kelly

Nelson guest starred on Hondo TV seriesHondo playing Jesse James and had a support role in The OvertheHill Gang 1969 with Walter Brennan and Pat OBrien actorPat OBrien

Nelson was in FoldeRol 1972 guest starred on McCloud TV seriesMcCloud The Streets of San Francisco Owen Marshall Counselor at Law Petrocelli Quinn Martins Tales of the UnexpectedA Twist in the Tale The Hardy BoysNancy Drew Mysteries and The Love Boat On The Hardy BoysNancy Drew Mysteries he played the part of Tony Eagle and performed various wellknown Nelson songs throughout the episode

He had support roles in the TV films Three on a Date and High School USA 1983

Name change and 1960s career

On May 8 1961 his 21st birthday he officially modified his recording name from Ricky Nelson to Rick Nelson His childhood nickname proved hard to shake especially among the generation who had watched him grow up on Ozzie and Harriet Even in the 1980s when Nelson realized his dream of meeting Carl Perkins Perkins noted that he and Ricky were the last of the rockabilly breed

In 1963 Nelson signed a 20year contract with Decca Records After some early successes with the label most notably 1964s For You 6 Nelsons chart career came to a dramatic halt in the wake of Beatlemania The British Invasion and later the Counterculture of the 1960sCounterculture era However instead of dropping him Decca kept him on board

In the mid1960s Nelson began to move toward country music becoming a pioneer in the countryrock genre He was one of the early influences of the socalled California Sound which would include singers like Jackson Browne and Linda Ronstadt and bands such as Eagles bandEagles Yet Nelson himself did not reach the Top 40 again until 1970 when he recorded Bob Dylans She Belongs to Me with the Stone Canyon Band featuring Randy Meisner who in 1971 became a founding member of the Eagles bandEagles and former The BuckaroosBuckaroo steel guitarist Tom Brumley

Garden Party and shortlived comeback

In 1972 Nelson reached the Top 40 one last time with Garden Party Rick Nelson songGarden Party a song he wrote in disgust after a Richard Nader Oldies Concert at Madison Square Garden where the audience booed perhaps against some unrelated police action However Nelson may have felt that the reason was because he was playing new songs instead of just his old hitsref namestraightdope1  When he performed The Rolling Stones Honky Tonk Women there was booing said to be against police and not himref namestraightdope1  He was watching the rest of the performance on a TV monitor backstage until Richard Nader finally convinced Nelson to return to the stage and play his oldies He returned to the stage and played his oldies and the audience responded with applause according to Deborah Nader President of Richard Nader Entertainment He wanted to record an album featuring original material but the single was released before the album because Nelson had not completed the entire Garden Party album yet Garden Party reached No 6 on the Billboard Hot 100Billboard Hot 100 and 1 on the Adult Contemporary chartBillboard Adult Contemporary chart and was certified as a RIAA certificationgold single The second single released from the album was Palace Guard which peaked at 65

In 1973 MCA Records whose parent company MCA Inc had owned American Decca since 1962 ceased the labels operations and transferred Nelson and many other Decca artists to its roster His comeback was shortlived and Nelsons band soon resigned MCA wanted Nelson to have a producer on his next album A new band was formed by Lindy Goetz then a promotion person at MCA Recordsref nameGoodReads  Nelsons band moved to Aspen and changed their name to Canyon Nelson and the new Stone Canyon Band began to tour for the Garden Party albumGarden Party album Nelson still played nightclubs and bars but he soon advanced to higherpaying venues because of the success of Garden Party

In 1974 MCA was unsure as to what to do with the former teen idol Albums like Windfall Rick Nelson albumWindfall failed to have an impact Nelson became an attraction at theme parks like Knotts Berry Farm and Disneyland He also started appearing in minor roles on television shows

Nelson tried to score another hit but did not have any luck with songs like Rock and Roll Lady With seven years to go on his contract MCA dropped him from the label

Personal life


In 1957 when Nelson was 17 he met and fell in love with Marianne Gaba who played the role of Rickys girlfriend in three episodes of Ozzie and Harriet Nelson and Gaba were too young to enter a serious relationship although according to Gaba we used to Making outneck for hours

The next year Nelson fell in love with 15yearold Lorrie Collins a country singer appearing on a weekly telecast called Town Hall Party The two wrote Nelsons first composition the song My Gal and she introduced him to Johnny Cash and Tex Ritter Collins appeared in an Ozzie and Harriet episode as Rickys girlfriend and sang Just Because with him in the musical finale They went steady and discussed marriage but their parents discouraged the idea

Kris Harmon

They married on April 20 1963 Kris was pregnant and Rick later described the union as a shotgun wedding Nelson a nonpracticing Protestant received instruction in Catholicism at the insistence of the brides parents and signed a pledge to have any children of the union raised in the Catholic faith Kris Nelson joined the television show as a regular cast member in 1963 They had four children actress Tracy Nelson actressTracy Kristine Nelson twin sons Gunnar Eric Nelson and Matthew Gray Nelson who formed the band Nelson bandNelson and Sam Hilliard Nelson

Helen Blair

In 1980 Nelson met Helen Blair a parttime model and exoticanimal trainer in Las Vegas Within months of their meeting she became his road companion and in 1982 she began living with him She was the only woman he dated after his divorce



Blair acted as personal assistant to Nelson organizing his day and acting as a liaison for his fan club but Nelsons mother brother business manager and manager disapproved of her presence in his life He contemplated marrying her but eventually declined Blair died with Nelson in the airplane fire Her name was never mentioned at Nelsons funeral Blairs parents wanted their daughter buried next to Nelson at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Hollywood HillsForest Lawn Cemetery but Harriet Nelson dismissed the idea The Blairs refused to bury Helens remains and filed a 2nbspmillion wrongful death suit against Nelsons estate They received a small settlement

Warren Smith February 7 1932  January 30 1980 was an American rockabilly and country music singer and guitarist

Biography
Smith was born in Humphreys County Mississippi to Ioda and Willie Warren Smith who divorced when he was young He was raised by his maternal grandparents in Louise Mississippi where they had a small farm and dry goods store

Smith took up the guitar to while away his evenings while in the United States Air Force stationed in San Antonio Texas By the time of his discharge from the service he had decided to make a career of music He moved to West Memphis Arkansas and auditioned successfully to play the Cotton Club a local nightclub The steel guitarist Stan Kesler who was playing there with the Snearly Ranch Boys immediately spotted Smiths potential and took him to Sun Records to audition for Sam Phillips with the Snearly Ranch Boys providing backup

Phillips liked what he heard and decided that Rock n Roll Ruby a song credited to Johnny Cash would be Smiths first record Smith later claimed that the song was actually written by George Jones and sold to Cash for 40 Smith recorded it on February 5 1956 Phillips playing it safe in case rock and roll did not maintain its popularity released it with a country crooner aptly named Id Rather Be Safe Than Sorry on the flip side By May 26 Rock n Roll Ruby had reached number 1 on the local pop chart this record his first for Sun went on to outsell the first Sun releases by Elvis Presley Johnny Cash and Carl Perkins

In August 1956 Smith went back to the Sun Records studio to record his second release Ubangi Stomp an infectious rocker with crude lyrics and vocals suggesting an African chief with the syntax of a movie Indian For the Aside and BsideBside he recorded the classic ballad The Gypsy LaddieBlack Jack David a song that originated in early 18thcentury Britain and survived in various forms in the mountains of the American South it may be the oldest song ever recorded by a rockandroll performer Although a resounding artistic success this record did not sell as well as Smiths debut

In 1957 Smith recorded So Long Im Gone a song written by Roy Orbison It became his biggest hit for Sun peaking at number 74 on the Billboard national chart But Sun had no cash to promote it as Sam Phillips put every dollar Sun had behind Jerry Lee Lewiss Whole Lotta Shakin Goin On Smith continued to make rockabilly records for Sun including a cover version of Slim Harpos Got Love If You Want It recorded in October 1957 but these records did not do well commercially Toward the end of 1958 seeing his future in country music he cut a final record for Sun a cover version of Don Gibsons Sweet Sweet Girl In spite of a review in Billboard magazineBillboard calling it ultra commercial this record also did not sell well Like other artists such as Sonny Burgess Hayden Thompson Billy Lee Riley and Ray Harris Smith had little success on the chartsref nameMusicref He then decided to leave Sun Records

In 1959 Smith and his wife and son moved from Mississippi to California settling in Sherman Oaks not far from Johnny and Vivian Cash Cash offered Smith a spot on his show but Smith turned it down seeing himself as a headliner not a supporting player In early 1960 Smith signed a contract with Liberty Records and immediately had a hit with I Dont Believe Ill Fall in Love Today which went to number 5 on the Billboard country and Western chart This record and subsequent Liberty releases were produced by Joe Allison and featured one of Californias best country session musicians Ralph Mooney on pedal steel guitar Smith scored again with his next record for Liberty Odds and Ends Bits and Pieces written by Harlan Howard He recorded several more tracks for Liberty mostly cover versions of recent country hits to fill out an album The First Country Collection of Warren Smith He continued to record for Liberty with some success and toured with his band from 1960 to 1965

On August 17 1965 Smith suffered severe back injuries in a car crash in LaGrange Texas It took nearly a year for him to recover By this time his contract with Liberty had lapsed He made several attempts to restart his career first with a small virtually amateur label called Skill Records and then with Mercury Records but addictions to pills and alcohol held him back Eventually he was convicted of robbing a pharmacy and sentenced to an 18month term in an Alabama prison

After his release from prison Smith again tried to restart his career He got some publicity from the rockabilly revival in the late 1970s In 1977 he was invited to appear at Londons Rainbow Theatre on a bill featuring Charlie Feathers Buddy Knox and Jack Scott singerJack Scott To his shock Smith was received in London with standing ovations His reception in England boosted his spirits and upon his return to the United States he began to perform with newfound vigor In November 1978 Smith and fellow Sun alumnus Ray Smith rockabilly singerRay Smith toured Europe again with great success

Smith died of a heart attack at 47 years of age in 1980 while preparing for another European tour

Legacy
Smiths contribution to rockabilly music has been recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame Bob Dylan repeatedly featured Smith on his XM Satellite Radio show Theme Time Radio Hour playing Smiths records Red Cadillac and a Black Moustache Uranium Rock Ubangi Stomp and So Long Im Gone Dylan recorded a studio version of Red Cadillac and a Black Moustache in 2001 he also played that song and another recorded by Smith Uranium Rock in concert in 1986 
In 2015 Uranium Rock was also featured in the video game Fallout 4 Uranium Rock was also covered by The Cramps on their second compilation album Bad Music For Bad People

Teen rock and roll star
The WRVA station announcer Carl Stutz wrote a song titled Will You Willyum and asked Martin to sing the song live on stage that Saturday night so that he could make a demo tape to send to his publisher in New York A week later Stutz called Martin to tell her that RCA Victor was interested in recording Will You Willyum As it happened the publisher offered Will You Willyum to Steve Sholes a producer at RCA Victor and asked whether Sholes had an artist to record it Apparently Sholes replied Well whos the girl doin the demo
