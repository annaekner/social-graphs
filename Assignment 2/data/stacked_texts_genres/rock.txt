Style and legacy

Rock and roll in the 1950s was defined by a driving Beat musicBackbeatbackbeat heavy guitars and lyrical themes that glorified youthful rebellionrefLehman p 8ref Few of Orbisons recordings have these characteristics The structure and themes of his songs defied convention and his muchpraised voice and performance style were unlike any other in rock and roll Many of his contemporaries compared his music with that of classically trained musicians although he never mentioned any classical music influences Peter Lehman summarized it writing He achieved what he did not by copying classical music but by creating a unique form of popular music that drew upon a wide variety of music popular during his youthrefLehman p 58ref Orbison was known as the Enrico CarusoCaruso Honorific nicknames in popular musicOof Rockref nameAmburnref namerollingstonecomref and the Big Oref namerollingstonecom

Song structures
Music critic Dave Marsh wrote that Orbisons compositions define a world unto themselves more completely than any other body of work in pop musicrefLehman p 20ref Orbisons music like the man himself has been described as timeless diverting from contemporary rock and roll and bordering on the eccentric within a hairs breadth of being weirdrefLehman p 9ref Peter Watrous writing for the New York Times declared in a concert review He has perfected an odd vision of popular music one in which eccentricity and imagination beat back all the pressures toward conformityref namewatrousWatrous Peter July 31 1988 Roy Orbison Mines Some Old Gold The New York Times p 48ref

In the 1960s Orbison refused to splice edits of songs together and insisted on recording them in single takes with all the instruments and singers togetherrefLehman p 46ref The only convention Orbison followed in his most popular songs is the time limit for radio fare in pop songs Otherwise each seems to follow a separate structure Using the standard 32bar form for verses and choruses normal pop songs followed the versechorusversechorusbridgeversechorus structure Where A represents the verse B represents the chorus and C the bridge most pop songs can be represented by ABABCAB like Ooby Dooby and Claudette Orbisons In Dreams was a song in seven movements that can be represented as IntroABCDEF no sections are repeated In Running Scared however the entire song repeats to build suspense to a final climax to be represented as AAAAB Crying is more complex changing parts toward the end to be represented as ABCDEFABCDEFrefLehman p 53ref Although Orbison recorded and wrote standard structure songs before Only the Lonely he claimed never to have learned how to write themref namenswhofref



Elton Johns songwriting partner and main lyricist Bernie Taupin wrote that Orbisons songs always made radical left turns and kd lang declared that good songwriting comes from being constantly surprised such as how the entirety of Running Scared eventually depends on the final note one wordrefLehman p 52ref Some of the musicians who worked with Orbison were confounded by what he asked them to do The Nashville session guitarist Jerry Kennedy stated Roy went against the grain The first time youd hear something it wouldnt sound right But after a few playbacks it would start to grow on youref nameAmburn

Lyrical themes
Critic Dave Marsh categorizes Orbisons ballads into themes reflecting pain and loss and dreaming A third category is his uptempo rockabilly songs such as Go Go Go and Mean Woman Blues that are more thematically simple addressing his feelings and intentions in a masculine braggadocio rapbraggadocio In concert Orbison placed the uptempo songs between the ballads to keep from being too consistently dark or grimrefLehman pp 7071ref

In 1990 Colin Escott wrote an introduction to Orbisons biography published in a CD box set Orbison was the master of compression Working the singles era he could relate a short story or establish a mood in under three minutes If you think thats easytry it His greatest recordings were quite simply perfect not a word or note surplus to intentionref nameescott After attending a show in 1988 Peter Watrous of The New York Times wrote that Orbisons songs are dreamlike claustrophobically intimate set piecesref namewatrous Music critic Ken Emerson writes that the apocalyptic romanticism in Orbisons music was wellcrafted for the films in which his songs appeared in the 1980s because the music was so overthetop that dreams become delusions and selfpity paranoia striking a postmodern nerverefDeCurtis and Henke p 157ref Led Zeppelin singer Robert Plant favored American RB music as a youth but beyond the black musicians he named Elvis and Orbison especially as foreshadowing the emotions he would experience The poignancy of the combination of lyric and voice was stunning Orbison used drama to great effect and he wrote dramaticallyref namehall

The loneliness in Orbisons songs that he became most famous for he both explained and downplayed I dont think Ive been any more lonely than anyone elsenbsp Although if you grow up in West Texas there are a lot of ways to be lonelyref namehall His music offered an alternative to the postured masculinity that was pervasive in music and culture Robin Gibb of the Bee Gees stated He made emotion fashionable that it was all right to talk about and sing about very emotional things For men to sing about very emotional thingsnbsp Before that no one would do itref namehall Orbison acknowledged this in looking back on the era in which he became popular When Crying came out I dont think anyone had accepted the fact that a man should cry when he wants to cryref namehall

Voice quality
ref


Orbison admitted that he did not think his voice was put to appropriate use until Only the Lonely in 1960 when it was able in his words to allow its floweringrefLehman p 50ref Carl Perkins however toured with Orbison while they were both signed with Sun Records and recalled a specific concert when Orbison covered the Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald standard Indian Love Call and had the audience completely silenced in awerefLehman p 49ref When compared to The Everly Brothers who often used the same session musicians Orbison is credited with a passionate intensity that according to The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock and Roll made his love his life and indeed the whole world seem to be coming to an endnot with a whimper but an agonised beautiful bangref namedecurtis155

Bruce Springsteen and Billy Joel both commented on the otherworldly quality of Orbisons voice Dwight Yoakam stated that Orbisons voice sounded like the cry of an angel falling backward through an open windowrefLehman p 22ref Barry Gibb of The Bee Gees went further to say that when he heard Crying for the first time That was it To me that was the voice of Godref namehallHall Mark director In Dreams The Roy Orbison Story Nashmount Productions Inc 1999ref Elvis Presley stated Orbisons voice was the greatest and most distinctive he  had ever heardref nameAmburn Orbisons music and voice have been compared to opera by Bob Dylan Tom Waits and songwriter Will Jennings among others Dylan marked Orbison as a specific influence remarking that there was nothing like him on radio in the early 1960srefDylan p 33ref



Likewise Tim Goodwin who conducted the orchestra that backed Orbison in Bulgaria had been told that Orbisons voice would be a singular experience to hear When Orbison started with Crying and hit the high notes Goodwin stated The strings were playing and the band had built up and sure enough the hair on the back of my neck just all started standing up It was an incredible physical sensationref nameAmburn Bassist Jerry Scheff who backed Orbison in his Roy Orbison and Friends A Black and White NightA Black and White Night concert wrote about him Roy Orbison was like an opera singer His voice melted out of his mouth into the stratosphere and back He never seemed like he was trying to sing he just did itrefScheff Jerry 2012 Way Down Playing Bass with Elvis Dylan the Doors  More Backbeat Books p 33ref

His voice ranged from baritone to tenor and music scholars have suggested that he had a three or fouroctave rangerefref

Orbisons severe stage fright was particularly noticeable in the 1970s and early 1980s During the first few songs in a concert the vibrato in his voice was almost uncontrollable but afterward it became stronger and more dependableref nameLehman p 24Lehman p 24ref This also happened with age Orbison noticed that he was unable to control the tremor in the late afternoon and evenings and chose to record in the mornings when it was possiblerefref

Live performances

Orbison often excused his motionless performances by saying that his songs did not allow instrumental sections so he could move or dance on stage although songs like Mean Woman Blues did offer thatrefLehman p 62ref He was aware of his unique performance style even in the early 1960s when he commented Im not a super personalityon stage or off I mean you could put workers like Chubby Checker or Bobby Rydell in secondrate shows and theyd still shine through but not me Id have to be prepared People come to hear my music my songs Thats what I have to give themrefClayson Alan p 78ref

kd lang compared Orbison to a tree with passive but solid beautyrefref This image of Orbison as immovable was so associated with him it was parodied by John Belushi on Saturday Night Live as Belushi dressed as Orbison falls over while singing Oh Pretty Woman and continues to play as his bandmates set him upright againref nameLehman p 24 However Lang quantified this style by saying Its so hard to explain what Roys energy was like because he would fill a room with his energy and presence but not say a word Being that he was so grounded and so strong and so gentle and quiet He was just thereref namehall

Orbison attributed his own passion during his performances to the period when he grew up in Fort Worth while the US was mobilizing for World War II His parents worked in a defense plant his father brought out a guitar in the evenings playing the driving rhythm of western swing and their friends and relatives who had just joined the military gathered to drink and sing heartily with him Orbison later reflected I guess that level of intensity made a big impression on me because its still there That sense of do it for all its worth and do it now and do it good Not to analyze it too much but I think the verve and gusto that everybody felt and portrayed around me has stayed with me all this timeref nameAmburn

History
19711973 formation and early releases
The Eagles had their origin in early 1971 when Linda Ronstadt and her manager John Boylan record producerJohn Boylan recruited musicians Glenn Frey and Don Henley for her bandref nameEaglesref Henley had moved to Los Angeles from Texas with his band Shiloh to record an album produced by Kenny Rogers and Frey had come from Michigan and formed Longbranch Pennywhistle the two then met in 1970 at The Troubadour West HollywoodThe Troubadour in Los Angeles and became acquainted through their mutual record label Amos Recordsrefref Randy Meisner who had been working with Ricky Nelsons backing band the Stone Canyon Band and Bernie Leadon a veteran of the Flying Burrito Brothers also later joined Ronstadts group of performers for her summer tour promoting the Silk Purse Linda Ronstadt albumSilk Purse albumref nameEaglesrefref

While on the tour with Ronstadt Frey and Henley decided to form a band together and informed Ronstadt of their intention Frey later credited Ronstadt with suggesting Leadon for the band and arranging for Leadon to play for her so Frey and Henley could approach him about forming a band together They also pitched the idea to Meisner and brought him on boardrefref These four played live together behind Ronstadt only once for a July concert at Disneylandref nameEagles but all four appeared on her Linda Ronstadt albumselftitled albumrefref It was later proposed that JD Souther should join the band but Meisner objected The four were signed in September 1971 to Asylum Records the new label started by David Geffen who was introduced to Frey by Jackson Browne Geffen bought out Freys and Henleys contracts with Amos Records and sent the four to Aspen Colorado to develop as a bandrefref Having not settled on a band name yet they performed their first show in October 1971 under the name of Teen King and the Emergencies at a club called The Gallery in Aspenrefrefrefref

The idea of naming the band Eagles came during a peyote and tequilainfluenced group outing in the Mojave Desert However accounts of the origin of the name vary Don Felder who had yet to join the Eagles and was not at the desert credited Leadon with originating the name when he recalled reading about the Hopis reverence for the eagle while Souther suggested that the idea came when Frey shouted out Eagles when they saw eagles flying aboverefref Steve Martin a friend of the band from their early days at The Troubadour recounts in his autobiography that he suggested that they should be referred to as the Eagles but Frey insists that the groups name is simply Eagles Geffen and partner Elliot Roberts initially managed the band they were later replaced by Irving Azoff while the Eagles were recording their third album

For their next album On the Border Henley and Frey wanted the band to break away from the country rock style and move more towards hard rock The Eagles initially started with Glyn Johns as the producer for this album but he tended to emphasize the lush side of their doubleedged music After completing only two usable songs the band turned to Bill Szymczyk to produce the rest of the albumrefref Szymczyk wanted a harderedged guitarist for the song Good Day in Hell and the band remembered Bernie Leadons childhood friend Don Felder a guitarist who had jammed backstage with the band in 1972 when they opened for Yes bandYes in Boston Felder had been nicknamed Fingers at the jam by Frey a name that stuck due to his guitar proficiency In January 1974 Frey called Felder to add slide guitar to the song Good Day in Hell and the band was so impressed that they invited him to join the group as the fifth Eagle the next day He appeared on one other song on the album the uptempo breakup song Already Gone Eagles songAlready Gone on which he performed a guitar duet with Frey Already Gone was released as the first single from the album and it reached number 32 on the charts On the Border yielded a number 1 Billboard magazineBillboard single Best of My Love Eagles songBest of My Love which hit the top of the charts on March 1 1975 The song was the Eagles first of five charttoppers The album included a cover version of the Tom Waits song Ol 55 and the single James Dean songJames Dean which reached number 77 on the charts

Leadons replacement was guitarist and singer Joe Walsh who had been a friend of the band for some years He had previously performed with James Gang Barnstorm bandBarnstorm and as a solo artist he was also managed by Azoff and used Szymczyk as his record producer There was some initial concern as to Walshs ability to fit in with the band as he was considered too wild for the Eagles especially by Henley After the departure of Leadon the Eagles early country sound almost completely disappeared with the band employing a harder sound with the addition of Felder and Walsh however Felder also had to play banjo pedal steel and mandolin on future tours something that had previously been Leadons domainrefref

Lyrics


Plant began writing song lyrics with Led Zeppelin during the making of Led Zeppelin II in 1969 According to Jimmy Page



Plants lyrics with Led Zeppelin were often mystical philosophical and spiritual alluding to events in classical and Norse mythology such as Immigrant Song which refers to Valhalla and Viking conquestsref The Faber Companion to 20th Century Popular Music  Credo Reference websitesearchcredoreferencecom accessdate23 April 2018ref However the song No Quarter songNo Quarter is often misunderstood to refer to the god Thor the song actually refers to Mount Thor which is named after the god Another example is The Rain Song

Plant was influenced by J R R TolkienrefRobert Plant himself in Vox magazineVox May 1993 page 18 stated The selfindulgence the silly overthetop Tolkienesque stuff  John BonhamJohn made it everlastingrefrefHelen Armstrong 1993 The Singer not the Song in Amon Hen the bulletin of The Tolkien Society UK no 123 p45ref whose book series inspired lyrics in some early Led Zeppelin songs Most notably The Battle of Evermore Misty Mountain Hop No Quarter songNo Quarter Ramble On and Over the Hills and Far Away Led Zeppelin songOver the Hills and Far Away contain verses referencing Tolkiens The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbitref name0  Conversely Plant sometimes used more straightforward blues themes dealing with sex as in The Lemon Song Trampled Under Foot about giving in to sexual temptationrefref and Black Dog Led Zeppelin songBlack Dog narrated by a man obsessed with a womanref ref

Welsh mythology forms a basis of Plants interest in mystical lyrics He grew up close to the Welsh border and would often take summer trips to Snowdonia Plant bought a Welsh sheep farm in 1973 and began taking Welsh lessons and looking into the mythology of the land such as Black Book of Carmarthen Book of Taliesin etc Plants first son Karac was named after the Welsh warrior Caratacus The song BronYAur Stomp is named after the 18thcentury Welsh cottage BronYrAur owned by a friend of his father it later inspired the song BronYrAur instrumentalBronYrAurref name0ref The songs Misty Mountain Hop Thats the Way Led Zeppelin songThats the Way and early dabblings in what would become Stairway to Heaven were written in Wales and lyrically reflect Plants mystical view of the land Critic Steve Turner suggests that Plants early and continued experiences in Wales served as the foundation for his broader interest in the mythologies he revisits in his lyrics including those myth systems of Tolkien and the NorserefStairway to Heaven Paved with Gold Led Zeppelins Snowdonia The Independent 6 April 1991ref

Pages passion for diverse musical experiences influenced Plant to explore Africa specifically Marrakesh in Morocco where he encountered Umm Kulthum

ref

Both he and Jimmy Page revisited these influences during their reunion album No Quarter Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded in 1994refref During his solo career Plant tapped into these influences many times most notably on the 2002 album Dreamland Robert Plant albumDreamland

Most of the lyrics of Stairway to Heaven from Led Zeppelin IV were written spontaneously by Plant in 1970 at Headley Grange while the track was being recorded While never released as a single the song has topped polls as the greatest song of all timerefref

Stage persona


Plant enjoyed great success with Led Zeppelin throughout the 1970s and developed a compelling image as the charismatic rockandroll front man similar to his contemporaries the Whos singer Roger Daltrey Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones and Jim Morrison of the Doorsref nametheirtimeTheir Time is Gonna Come Classic Rock Magazine Classic Rock Presents Led Zeppelin 2008ref With his mane of long blond hair and powerful barechested appearance Plant helped to create the god of rock and roll or rock god archetype On stage Plant was particularly active in live performances often dancing jumping skipping snapping his fingers clapping making emphatic gestures to emphasise a lyric or cymbal crash throwing back his head or placing his hands on his hips As the 1970s progressed he along with the other members of Led Zeppelin became increasingly flamboyant onstage and wore more elaborate colourful clothing and jewellery

According to Classic Rock magazineClassic Rock magazine once he had a couple of US tours under his belt Percy Plant swiftly developed a staggering degree of bravado and swagger that irrefutably enhanced Led Zeppelins rapidly burgeoning appealrefFortnam Ian 2008 Dazed  Confused Classic Rock Magazine Classic Rock Presents Led Zeppelin p 43ref In 1994 during his Unledded tour with Jimmy Page Plant himself reflected tongueincheek upon his Led Zeppelin showmanship

ref

One of the oddest awards he received was the Rock Scene magazine Chest O Rama Readers of the magazine had to decide who had the best chest in rock and Plant was the winner When they contacted him about it he replied Im really greatly honoured although its hard for me to be eloquent on the subject of my chestrefRock Scene June 1974 Four Seasons Publications Inc 592874ref

Loggins had a short gig playing guitar for The Electric PrunesThe New Improved Electric Prunesthe New Improved Electric Prunes in 1969 before writing four songs for the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band that were included on their album Uncle Charlie  His Dog Teddyref namePOEMhttpwwwpoemhuntercomlyricskennylogginsbiography Biography Kenny Loggins Poem Huntercomref During his early 20s he was in the band Gator Creek with Mike Deasy The first recorded version of Dannys Song later recorded by Loggins and Messina and a No 7 Hot 100 hit for Anne Murray in 1973 was included on their only album released on Mercury Records

 Loggins and Messina 
Jim Messina musicianJim Messina formerly of Poco bandPoco and Buffalo Springfield was working as an independent record producer for Columbia Records in 1970 when he was introduced to Loggins then a littleknown singersongwriter who was signed to ABC RecordsABCDunhill

The two recorded a number of Logginss compositions in Messinas home living room When Columbia signed Loggins with Messinas help to a sixalbum contract recording began in earnest for Logginss debut album with Messina as producer He assembled The Kenny Loggins Band by summoning his old friends bassist Larry Sims and drummer Merel Bregante both formerly of the Sunshine Company a disbanded 1960s group from Los Angeles violinistmultireedist Al Garth and multireedist Jon Clarke Keyboardist Michael Omartian also played on the album and despite dropping out at the start of the touring continued to play keyboards on the next two albums Los Angelesbased session percussionist Milt Holland described by Messina as an ethnomusicologyethnomusicologist also contributedrefref

Messina originally intended to lend his name to the Loggins project only to help introduce the unknown Loggins to Messinas wellestablished Buffalo Springfield and Poco audiences But by the time the album was completed Messina had contributed so much to the album in terms of songwriting arrangement instrumentation and vocals that an accidental duo was born Thus the full name of their first album was Sittin In Loggins and Messina albumKenny Loggins with Jim Messina Sittin In The albums first single release the Caribbeanflavored Vahevala found top 3 success on WCFL AMWCFL on May 18 1972refref


Although the album went unnoticed by radio upon release it eventually found success by fall 1972 particularly on college campuses where the pair toured heavily Loggins and Messinas vocal harmonies meshed so well that what was begun as a oneoff album became an entity in itself Audiences regarded the pair as a genuine duo rather than as a solo act with a wellknown producer Instead of continuing to produce Loggins as a sole performer they decided to record as a duo Loggins  Messina

When our first album Sittin In came out we started receiving a lot of excitement about the music and good sales Messina recalled in 2005


Both members of the duo were guitarists Loggins played rhythm guitar with both acoustic and electric guitar and harmonica and Messina played lead guitar with both acoustic and electric guitar mandolin and Dobro Over the next four years they produced five more albums of original material in the studio plus one album of Cover versioncovers of other artists material and two live albums They sold 16 million records and were the most successful duo of the early 1970s surpassed later in the decade only by Daryl Hall  John Oatesref nameThibodeaux  Their work also included Lynn Andersons Listen to a Country Song songListen to a Country Song which was released in 1972 and reached Nonbsp4 on the US Billboard magazineBillboard Hot Country Singles chart and Dannys Song and A Love Song Loggins and Messina songA Love Song for Anne Murray which reached Nonbsp7 and Nonbsp12 on the Billboard Hot 100 pop chart in 1973 and 1974 respectively  The latter two songs also hit Nonbsp1 on the Canadian RPM magazineRPM Top Singles chart Later studio albums often found Loggins and Messina more as two solo artists sharing the same record than as a genuine partnership As they both noted in 2005 their collaboration eventually became more a competition Following their January 1976 release of Native Sons Loggins and Messina albumNative Sons and a final concert in Honolulu Hawaii on September 25 1976 the pair amicably and quietly parted to pursue solo careers A greatesthits album The Best of Friends albumThe Best of Friends was released in November 1976 Two months later a live album Finale albumFinale was released more by record company decision than one intended by the artists one year after the duo had come to an end

 Solo career

Career

1960s
Diamond was not rehired after his 16 weeks with Sunbeam and he began writing and singing his own songs for demos I never really chose songwriting he says It just absorbed me and became more and more important in my liferef nameRS76 His first recording contract was billed as Neil and Jack an The Everly BrothersEverly Brotherstype duet with high school friend Jack Packerref nameRS88 They recorded the unsuccessful singles You Are My Love at Last with What Will I Do and Im Afraid with Till Youve Tried Love both records released in 1962 Cashbox and Billboard magazines gave all four sides positive reviews and Diamond signed with Columbia Records as a solo performer later in 1962 In July 1963 Columbia released the single Clown Town  At Night Billboard gave a laudatory review to Clown Town and Cashbox was complimentary to both sides but it still failed to make the charts Columbia dropped him from their label and he went back to writing songs in and out of publishing houses for the next seven years

Diamond wrote wherever he could including on buses and used an upright piano above the Birdland New York jazz clubBirdland Club in New York City One of the causes of this early nomadic life as a songwriter was his songs wordiness Id spent a lot of time on lyrics and they were looking for hooks and I didnt really understand the nature of that he saysref nameRS76 He was able to sell only about one song a week during those years barely enough to survive He found himself only earning enough to spend 35 cents a day on food equivalent to  in ref nameRS76 But the privacy that he had above the Birdland Club allowed him to focus on writing without distractions Something new began to happen I wasnt under the gun and suddenly interesting songs began to happen songs that had things none of the others didref nameRS76 Among them were Cherry Cherry and Solitary Man songSolitary Man Solitary Man was the first record that Diamond recorded under his own name which made the charts It remains one of his personal favorites as it was about his early years as a songwriter even though he failed to realize it at the time He describes the song as an outgrowth of my despairref nameJackson

Diamond began to feel restricted by Bang Records because he wanted to record more ambitious introspective music such as Brooklyn Roads starting in 1968 Berns wanted to release Kentucky Woman as a single but Diamond was no longer satisfied writing simple pop songs so he proposed Shilo songShilo which was not about the American Civil WarCivil War but rather an imaginary childhood friend Bang believed that the song was not commercial enough so it was relegated to being an LP track on Just for You Neil Diamond albumJust for You Diamond was also dissatisfied with his royalties and tried to sign with another record label after discovering a loophole in his contract that did not bind him exclusively to either WEB IV or Tallyrand but the result was a series of lawsuits that coincided with a slump in his record sales and professional success A magistrate refused WEB IVs request for a temporary injunction to prevent Diamond from joining another record company while his contract dispute continued in court but the lawsuits persisted until February 1977 when he triumphed in court and purchased the rights to his Bangera master tapesref nameJackson

From the liner notes of Bennetts solo album Themes From A Rainy Decade Mark Knopfler writes For almost ten years now Ive felt very lucky having Richard Bennett as a pal and as a member of the band His quiet selfeffacing manner hides an encyclopedic knowledge of all kinds of roots and rock music from Hillbilly to Hawaiian played effortlessly on a variety of instruments which appear out of a flight case as big as an Airstream trailer May his cracking guitar playing find a place in your life as it has in mine

Bernard Matthew Leadon III pronounced LEHdun born July 19 1947refref is an American singer musician songwriter and founding member of the Eagles bandEagles for which he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998 Prior to the Eagles he was a member of three country rock bands Hearts  Flowers Dillard  Clark and the Flying Burrito Brothers He is a multiinstrumentalist guitar banjo mandolin steel guitar dobro coming from a Bluegrass musicbluegrass background He introduced elements of this music to a mainstream audience during his tenure with the Eagles

Leadons music career since leaving the Eagles has been lowkey resulting in two solo albums the first actually being a collaborative project with Michael Georgiades with a gap of 27 years in between Leadon has also appeared on many other artists records as a session musician

Early life and musical beginnings

In San Diego California Leadon met fellow musicians Ed Douglas and Larry Murray of the local bluegrass outfit the Scottsville Squirrel Barkers The Barkers proved a breeding ground for future California country rock talent including shy 18yearold mandolin player Chris Hillman with whom Leadon maintained a lifelong friendship Augmented by banjo player and future Flying Burrito Brother Kenny Wertz the Squirrel Barkers eventually asked Leadon to join the group upon Wertzs joining the United States Air ForceAir Force in 1963

He later met  future Eagles lead guitarist Don Felder whose band the Continentals had just lost guitarist Stephen Stills 

A call from exSquirrel Barker Larry Murray in 1967 to join his fledgling psychedelic countryfolk group Hearts  Flowers brought Leadon to California where he became involved with the burgeoning LA folkcountry rock scene Leadon recorded one album with the band its second release Of Horses Kids and Forgotten Women for Capitol Records The record was a local hit but failed to make much of a dent on the national album charts Discouraged the group disbanded the following year

Dillard  Clark
By late 1968 Leadon had befriended bluegrassbanjo legend Doug Dillard late of the Dillards While staying with Dillard informal jam sessions with songwriter and exByrds member Gene Clark began to take shape and morphed into what eventually became the countryrock band Dillard  Clark In 1968 the group recorded The Fantastic Expedition of Dillard  Clark featuring Leadons backing vocals and multiinstrumental work The album included several compositions cowritten with Clark most notably the future Eagles staple and somewhat of a signature song for Leadon from their debut album Train Leaves Here This Morning

The Flying Burrito Brothers
 Rick Roberts musicianRick Roberts Chris Hillman Michael Clarke musicianMichael Clarke Bernie Leadon
Leadon left Dillard  Clark in 1969 eventually reconnecting with exSquirrel Barker and exByrd Chris Hillman who asked him to join the Flying Burrito Brothers a fledgling countryrock band that Hillman had formed a year earlier with fellow exByrd Gram Parsons Leadon recorded two albums with the group Burrito Deluxe and the postParsons LP The Flying Burrito Bros albumThe Flying Burrito Bros After the latter albums release in 1971 Leadon had tired of the bands lack of commercial success and decided to leave the band to pursue an opportunity to play with three musicians he had worked with while moonlighting in Linda Ronstadts backing band that summer forming the Eagles

Eagles

Leadon was the last original member to join the Eagles a band initially formed by guitaristsinger Glenn Frey drummersinger Don Henley and former Poco bandPoco bassistsinger Randy Meisner Leadon is often credited with helping shape the bands early countryrock sound bringing his strong sense of harmony as well as his country bluegrass and acoustic sensibilities to the group Instruments he played during his tenure in the band were electric guitar BBender acoustic guitar banjo mandolin dobro and pedal steel guitar

Upon the release of their debut album Eagles albumEagles the group met with near instant success due largely to the strength of their hit singles Take It Easy Peaceful Easy Feeling and Witchy Woman cowritten by Leadon and Henley all of which highlighted Leadons multiinstrumental talent and harmony vocals Their followup Desperado Eagles albumDesperado was another strong countryrock venture highlighted by the classics Tequila Sunrise Eagles songTequila Sunrise and the Desperado Eagles songtitle track Leadon had a prominent role on the album but it was met by surprisingly lukewarm reviews and lackluster sales As a result the band attempted to distance itself from the country rock label for their third album On the Border In doing so Leadon encouraged the group to recruit his old friend guitarist Don Felder to the band The result was the guitarheavy top 40 hit Already Gone Eagles songAlready Gone The album also included My Man Leadons touching tribute to his old bandmate and friend Gram Parsons who had died of a drug overdose the year prior at Joshua Tree National ParkJoshua Tree National Monument in southeastern California

With the wild success of On the Border and its followup smash One of These Nights tension within the band grew with some sources saying Leadon grew increasingly frustrated by the bands direction away from his beloved country and bluegrass toward albumoriented stadium rock He famously quit the band in 1975 by pouring a beer over Glenn Freys headrefEliot Marc 2005 httpsbooksgooglecombooksido_EjE6iyQoC To the Limit The Untold Story of the Eagles p 131 Da Capo Pressref He later cited a need to get healthy and break the vicious cycle of touring recording and heavy drug use that was rampant within the band

Upon Leadons departure Asylum Records released Their Greatest Hits 19711975 which highlighted the bands Leadon years and went on to become the bestselling album in United States history with sales in excess of 38 million units He was replaced by former James Gang guitarist and singer Joe Walsh

Although it has long been believed that he left because he was dissatisfied with the band moving into rock and roll Leadon denies it and said in 2013 Thats an oversimplification it implies that I had no interest in rock or blues or anything but country rock Thats just not the case I didnt just play Fender Telecaster I played a Gibson Les Paul and I enjoyed rock  roll Thats evident from the early albumsrefref

Later career

Upon leaving the Eagles Leadon retreated from the limelight only to resurface in 1977 with musician friend Michael Georgiades for the album Natural Progressions credited to The Bernie LeadonMichael Georgiades Band featuring Leadon and Georgiades on guitars and alternating lead vocals along with Bryan Garofalo on bass Dave Kemper on drums and Steve Goldstein on keyboard

In 1985 he recorded an album of bluegrass and gospel favorites under the name Ever Call Ready featuring Chris Hillman and Al Perkins He also had a short stint with the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band in the late 1980s

In 1993 he became a member of Run CW a novelty group singing Motown hits bluegrass style recording two albums for MCA Records

In 1998 Leadon reunited with the Eagles in New York City for the bands induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame All seven current and former Eagles members performed together on Take It Easy and Hotel California

In 2004 he released his second solo effort in 27 years and his first under solely his name Mirror

Leadon toured with the Eagles from 2013 through 2015 during their History of the Eagles  Live in ConcertHistory of the Eagles Tourref nameMiamirefrefref In 2015 Leadon appeared on producer Ethan Johns third solo album Silver Liner

In February 2016 Leadon appeared at the Grammy Awards ceremony with Jackson Browne and the surviving Eagles members  Don Henley Joe Walsh and Timothy B Schmit  performing Take it Easy in tribute to Glenn Frey who had died a month earlierref namegrammyref

 Personal life 
For a few years in the mid1970s Leadon lived in Topanga CaliforniaTopanga Canyon a Bohemianismbohemian enclave known for its musician residents Leadons houseplusrecordingstudio had previously been owned by singersongwriter Neil Young and was the site of frequent partiesrefref Leadon lived with Patti Davis the daughter of conservative California Governor Ronald Reagan who was at that time campaigning for president and distancing himself from his daughter because Leadon and she were unmarried but living together Leadon and Davis cowrote the song I Wish You Peace which Leadon insisted the Eagles include on the album One of These Nights against the wishes of his bandmatesrefrefrefref

Clark wrote or cowrote many of the Byrds bestknown originals from their first three albums including Ill Feel a Whole Lot Better Set You Free This Time Here Without You You Wont Have to Cry If Youre Gone The World Turns All Around Her She Dont Care About Time and Eight Miles High He initially played rhythm guitar in the band but relinquished that position to David Crosby and became the tambourine and harmonica playerrefref Bassist Chris Hillman noted years later in an interview remembering Clark At one time he was the power in the Byrds not McGuinn not Crosbyit was Gene who would burst through the stage curtain banging on a tambourine coming on like a young Prince Valiant A hero our savior Few in the audience could take their eyes off this presence He was the songwriter He had the gift that none of the rest of us had developed yet What deep inner part of his soul conjured up songs like Set You Free This Time Ill Feel A Whole Lot Better Im Feelin Higher Eight Miles High So many great songs We learned a lot of songwriting from him and in the process learned a little bit about ourselvesrefref

A management decision gave McGuinn the lead vocals for their major singles and Bob Dylan songs This disappointment combined with Clarks dislike of traveling including a chronic fear of flying and resentment by other band members about the extra income he derived from his songwriting led to internal squabbling and he left the group in early 1966refref He briefly returned to Kansas City before moving back to Los Angeles to form Gene Clark  the Group with Chip Douglas Joel Larson and Bill Rhinehartrefref

Solo career brief return to the Byrds and Dillard and Clark
Columbia Records the Byrds record label signed Clark as a solo artist and in 1967 he released his first solo album Gene Clark with the Gosdin Brothers The Gosdin Brothers were selected to back him because they shared the same manager Jim Dickson and because Chris Hillman who played bass on the album had worked with the Gosdin Brothers in the mid1960s when he and they were members of the Southern California bluegrass band the The HillmenHillmenrefref The album was a unique mixture of pop country rock and baroque psychedelic tracks It received favorable reviews but unfortunately for Clark it was released almost simultaneously with the Byrds Younger Than Yesterday also on Columbia and partly because of his 18month absence from public attention was a commercial failurerefref

With the future of his solo career in doubt Clark briefly rejoined the Byrds in October 1967 as a replacement for the recently departed David Crosby following an anxiety attack in Minneapolis he left after only three weeksref nameeinarsonref During this brief period with the Byrds he appeared with the band on The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour lipsynching the groups current single Goin Back he also performed Mr Spaceman with the bandrefref Although there is some disagreement among the bands biographers Clark is generally viewed as having contributed background vocals to the songs Goin Back and Space Odyssey for the forthcoming Byrds album The Notorious Byrd Brothers and was an uncredited coauthor with McGuinn of Get to You also from that albumref nameeinarson

In 1968 Clark signed with AM Records and began a collaboration with the banjo player the DillardsDoug Dillardrefref Guitarist Bernie Leadon later with The Flying Burrito Brothers and Eagles bandThe Eagles bassist Dave Jackson and mandolinist Don Beck joined them to form the nucleus of Dillard  Clark in addition Michael Clarke briefly drummed for the group before joining The Flying Burrito Brothersrefref They produced two albums The Fantastic Expedition of Dillard  Clark 1968 and Through the Morning Through the Night 1969

The Fantastic Expedition of Dillard  Clark was a pivotal work of acoustic country rock It included such enduring songs as Train Leaves Here This Morning a collaboration between Clark and Leadon prominently covered by the latter in 1972 on The Eagles Eagles albumdebut album and She Darked the Sun covered by Linda Ronstadt on her 1970 album Silk Purse Linda Ronstadt albumSilk Purse In contrast Through the Morning Through the Night was more indebted to traditional bluegrass but also employed electric instrumentation By this juncture Dillards girlfriend Donna Washburn had joined the group as a backing vocalist a factor that precipitated the departure of Leadonrefref The shift to traditional bluegrass also caused Clark to lose interestrefref Written by Clark the title song was used by Quincy Jones in the soundtrack of the 1972 Sam Peckinpah film The Getaway 1972 filmThe Getaway it was also covered by Robert Plant and Alison Krauss along with Polly another Clarkpenned track from the album on their 2007 album Raising Sand Both albums by Dillard  Clark fared poorly on the charts but they are now regarded as seminal exemplars of the country rock and progressive bluegrass genresrefref
The collaboration with Dillard rejuvenated Clarks creativity but greatly contributed to his growing drinking problemrefref Dillard  Clark disintegrated in late 1969 after the departures of Clark and Leadon During this period Clark Leadon Jackson and Beck contributed to the debut album of Steve Young musicianSteve Young Rock Salt  Nails albumRock Salt  Nails released in November 1969refref

In 1970 Clark began work on a new single recording two tracks with the original members of the Byrds each recording his part separately The resulting songs Shes the Kind of Girl and One in a Hundred were not released at the time because of legal problems they were included later on the 1973 album Roadmaster albumRoadmasterrefref In 1970 and 1971 Clark contributed vocals and two compositions Tried So Hard and Here Tonight to albums by the Flying Burrito Brothersrefref

Frustrated with the music industry Clark bought a house in Albion California and married former gogo dancer and Bell Records production assistant Carlie Lynn McCummings in June 1970 with whom he had two sons Kelly and Kai Clark In semiretirement he subsisted on his stillsubstantial Byrds royalties throughout the early 1970s augmented by income from The Turtles 1969 American Top Ten hit You Showed Me a previously unreleased composition by McGuinn and Clark from 1964 rearranged for the band by Chip Douglasrefrefrefref

In 1972 Clark attempted to record a followup album Progress was slow and expensive and AM terminated the project before completionrefref The resulting eight tracks including Full Circle Song and In a Misty Morning along with those recorded with the Byrds in 1970 and 1971 Shes the Kind of Girl and One in a Hundred and with the Flying Burrito Brothers Here Tonight were released in 1973 as Roadmaster albumRoadmaster in the Netherlands onlyrefref

Byrds
Clark left AM in late 1972 to join a reunion of the original five Byrds They cut the album Byrds albumByrds which was released in March 1973 by Asylum Records While the album charted relatively well US No 20 its placement did not live up to the labels initial expectations in the wake of the recent success of Crosby Crosby Stills Nash  Young and Hillman a member of Stephen Stillss band Manassas bandManassas Clarks compositions Full Circle SongFull Circle and Changing Heart and the Neil Young covers on which he sang the lead vocal See the Sky About to Rain and Cowgirl in the Sand were widely regarded as the standout tracks on the critically divisive albumref nameEinarson 2005 182ref Disheartened by the bad reviews and unhappy with Crosbys performance as the records producer the group members chose to dissolve the bandrefref Clark briefly joined McGuinns solo group with which he premiered Silver Raven arguably his most celebrated postByrds songref nameEinarson 2005 182

No Other
On the basis of the quality of Clarks contributions to Byrds David Geffen signed him to Asylum Records in early 1974refref The label was the home of the most prominent exponents of the singersongwriter movement of the era and carried the kind of hip cachet that Clark hadnt experienced since his days with the Byrdsrefref While composing the album he spent long periods with a notebook and an acoustic guitar at the picture window of his home deriving inspiration from staring at the Pacific Ocean

Produced by Thomas Jefferson Kaye with a vast array of session musicians including members of The Section bandThe Section and the The Allman Brothers BandAllman Brothers Band and backing singers the ensuing No Other fused elements of country rock folk gospel soul and choral music with poetic mystical lyricsrefref Although the album was praised by critics its unconventional arrangements which anticipated the later innovations of Lindsey Buckingham Stevie Nicks and Christine McVierefref limited public appeal Furthermore its high production costs exceeding 100000 prompted Geffen to publicly berate Clark and Kayerefref The album was minimally promoted and stalled in the Billboard album chart at No 144refref In 2013 members of the bands Beach House The Walkmen Grizzly Bear bandGrizzly Bear and Fleet Foxes performed the album in its entirety in a series of concertsrefref

Two Sides to Every Story
After the commercial failure of No Other Clark was confused about his artistic direction Throughout 1975 and 1976 he had hinted to the press that he was assembling a set of cosmic songs fusing country rock with Rhythm and bluesRB and funk elaborating on the soundscapes of his most recent album In 1976 he recorded a set of ten demos that combined country and folk music with a light touch of cosmic consciousness These were submitted to RSO Records which promptly bought out Clarks Asylum contract and issued the longgestating Two Sides to Every Story in 1977 The albuma melange of bluegrass traditional honky tonk echoes of No Other Sister Moon and strident country rock a new arrangement of Kansas City Southernwas produced by Kaye with an understated touchref nameRogan 2008 370ref

The emotional fallout from his divorce is reflected in the album title and several of Clarks compositions including the aforementioned Sister Moon Lonely Saturday Past Addresses Silent Crusade and Hear the Wind The album also contains covers of the traditional In the Pines a key component of Clarks live repertoire with the Silverados and Give My Love to Marie by James Talley Once again his style of sensitive balladry failed to achieve success on the US charts In a belated attempt to find an appreciative public he reluctantly overcame his travel anxiety and launched an international promotional tour with the KC Southern Bandrefref Some six weeks before his death in 1991 Clark told interviewer Bill Wasserzieher that he considered Two Sides to Every Story his best album rivaled only by No OtherrefWasserzieher Bill In Memoriam The Byrds Gene Clark 19441991 wwwrocksbackpagescom September 1991ref

McGuinn Clark  Hillman
For his British tour dates Clark found himself on the same bill as exByrds Roger McGuinn and Chris Hillman each fronting their own bandsrefref Shortly after returning to the United States Clark and McGuinn began touring as an acoustic duo After Hillman joined his former bandmates the reformed trio named themselves McGuinn Clark  Hillman and signed with Capitol Recordsrefref Produced by the Albert Brothers who had recently recorded Crosby Stills  Nashs CSN album1977 comeback album the ensuing McGuinn Clark  Hillman 1979 was a rebirth in both performing and songwriting for Clark who ensconced himself as the groups dominant creative force He wrote four songs for the album including Backstage Pass a rumination on the ennui of touring and his fear of flying Release Me Girl a discoinflected collaboration with Thomas Jefferson Kaye the UFOinspired Feelin Higher and Little Mamarefref

Many critics felt that the albums slick production and discoinfluenced soft rock rhythms didnt flatter the group but the album reached No 39 on the Billboard 200Billboard 200 underpinned by the McGuinnpenned Dont You Write Her Off which peaked at No 33 in May 1979 and earned a RIAA gold certification selling well enough to generate a followuprefref McGuinn Clark and Hillmans second release was to have been a full group effort entitled City although it was ultimately released in 1980 a combination of Clarks unreliability including experimentation with heroin and his dissatisfaction with their musical direction mostly regarding Ron and Howard Alberts production resulted in the album being credited to Roger McGuinn  Chris Hillman featuring Gene Clark Despite the turmoil Clark penned the song Wont Let You Down By 1981 Clark had left and the group recorded one more album as McGuinnHillmanrefref

Despite the critical success of So Rebellious a Lover which led to several TV appearances including Nashville Now Clark was increasingly afflicted with serious health problems including ulcers and alcohol dependence In 1988 he underwent surgery to remove a malignant ulcer

A period of abstinence and recovery followed until Tom Petty covered Ill Feel a Whole Lot Better on Full Moon Fever 1989 yielding a windfall of royalties from the album which peaked at No 3 in the United States to Clark Flush with money he began to neglect his professional obligations Although the circumstances remain nebulous with Carla Olson citing alleged financial improprieties the binge also precipitated his final breakup with Terri Messina who had had a twodecade onagain offagain relationship with Clarkrefref

During this period The Byrds set aside their differences long enough to appear together at their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in January 1991 at which the original lineup performed several songs together including Clarks Ill Feel a Whole Lot Betterrefref

Zevon turned to a musical career early forming a musical duo with his high school friend Violet Santangelo called lyme and cybelle Bones Howe produced their first single the minor hit Follow Me which was written by Zevon and Santangelo and reached number 65 on the Billboard magazineBillboard Hot 100pop charts in April 1966 A followup single a cover of Bob Dylans If You Gotta Go Go Now flopped and Zevon left the duo A third single without Zevon and another session that included him but was not previously released were included on the 2003 compilation The First Sessions

Zevons first attempt at a solo album Wanted Dead or Alive Warren Zevon albumWanted Dead or Alive 1970 was spearheaded by 1960s cult figure Kim Fowley but received almost no attention and did not sell well Though Zevon continued to play occasional live dates as a solo artist the next several years of his career were dominated by session work with other musicians

During the early 1970s Zevon toured regularly with The Everly Brothers as keyboard player band leader and musical coordinatorref nameRolling Stone Bio Later the same decade he toured with Don Everly and Phil Everly separately as they tried to launch solo careers after their breakup He worked particularly closely with Phil arranging and playing keyboards on his first and third solo albums Star Spangled Springer 1973 and Mystic Line 1975 and cowriting tracks on his second and third albums Phils Diner 1974 and the aforementioned Mystic Line Zevons song Carmelita songCarmelita was also recorded by Canadian singer Murray McLauchlan on his Murray McLauchlan albumselftitled album of 1972

These small successes were not particularly rewarding financially and Zevons dissatisfaction with his career and a lack of funds led him to briefly move to Spain in the summer of 1975 He lived and played in the Dubliner Bar a small tavern in Sitges near Barcelona owned by David Lindell who was a mercenary Together they composed Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner

During this time Zevon collaborated with Bill Berry Peter Buck and Mike Mills of REM and backup vocalist Bryan Cook to form a minor project called Hindu Love Gods bandHindu Love Gods The group released the noncharting single Narrator for IRS Records in 1984 then went into abeyance for several years

Berry Buck and Mills served as the core of Zevons next studio band when he reemerged in 1987 by signing with Virgin Records and recording the album Sentimental Hygiene The release hailed as his best since Excitable Boy featured a thicker rock sound and taut often humorous songs like Detox Mansion Bad Karma which featured REM lead singer Michael Stipe on backup vocals and Reconsider Me Included were contributions from Neil Young Bob Dylan Flea musicianFlea Brian Setzer and George Clinton funk musicianGeorge Clinton as well as Berry Buck and Mills Also on hand were Zevons longtime collaborators Jorge Calderón and Waddy Wachtel

After the Decibels disbanded Seger joined the Town Criers a fourpiece band with Seger on lead vocals John Flis on bass Pep Perrine on drums and Larry Mason on lead guitar The Town Criers covering songs like Louie Louie began gaining a steady following Meanwhile Seger was listening to James Brown and said that for him and his friends Live at the Apollo 1963 albumLive at the Apollo was their favorite record following its release in 1963 Seger was also influenced by the music of The Beatles once they hit American shores in 1964 In general he and local musician friends such as Glenn Frey later a member of the Eagles bandEagles bought into the premises of 1960s pop and rock radio with its hookdriven hits he later recalled himself and Frey thinking at the time Youre nobody if you cant get on the radioref namecst2011

 Doug Brown  The Omens 
As the Town Criers began landing more gigs Seger met a man named Doug Brown backed by a band called The Omens Seger joined Doug Brown  The Omens who had a bigger following than the Town Criers While Brown was the primary lead vocalist for the group Seger would take the lead on some songscovering rhythm and bluesRB numbersref nameoral With this group Seger first appeared on an officially released recording the 1965 single TGIF backed with First Girl credited to Doug Brown and The Omens Seger later appeared on Doug Brown and The Omens parody of Barry Sadlers song Ballad of the Green Berets which was retitled Ballad of the Yellow Beret and mocked draft evaders Soon after its release Sadler and his record label threatened Brown and his band with a lawsuit and the recording was withdrawn from the marketref nameReferenceARolling Stone Editors The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock  Roll Revised and Updated for the 21st Century New York Fireside 2001ref

Capitol changed the name of the band to The Bob Seger System In the transition between labels guitarist Carl Lagassa left the band and keyboard player Bob Schultz joined The Systems first single with Capitol was the antiwar message song 2  2   which reflected a marked change in Segers political attitudes from The Ballad of the Yellow Beret The single was again a hit in Detroit and hit number 1 on radio stations in Buffalo New York and Orlando Floridarefref but went unnoticed almost everywhere else and failed to chart nationally in the US The single did however make the Canadian national charts peaking at 

The second single from The Bob Seger System was Ramblin Gamblin Man songRamblin Gamblin Man It was a major hit in Michigan and it also became Segers first national hit peaking at  The songs success led to the release of an album of the same title in 1969 The Ramblin Gamblin Man album reached  on the Billboard 200Billboard pop albums chart Glenn Frey had his first studio gig singing backup and playing guitar on Ramblin Gamblin ManrefHistory of the Eagles Sundance Institute 2013ref

Seger was unable to follow up on this success For the next album singersongwriter Tom Neme joined The System ultimately writing and singing the majority of the tunes featured for which the group was heavily criticized The album called Noah The Bob Seger System albumNoah 1969 failed to chart at all leading Seger to briefly quit the music industry and attend college He returned the following year and put out the Systems final album 1970s Mongrel The Bob Seger System albumMongrel this time without Neme Bob Schultz left the band as well being replaced by Dan Watson Mongrel with the powerful single Lucifer Bob Seger songLucifer was considered to be a strong album by many critics and Detroit fans but failed to do well commercially

The Monkees



From 1965 to early 1970 Nesmith  along with Micky Dolenz Peter Tork and Davy Jones musicianDavy Jones  was a member of the television poprock band the Monkees created for the television The Monkees TV seriessituation comedy of the same name Nesmith won his role largely by appearing nonchalant when he auditionedref name0 He rode his motorcycle to the audition and wore a knit capwool hat to keep his hair out of his eyes producers Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider remembered the wool hat guy and called Nesmith back

Once he was cast Screen Gems bought his songs so they could be used in the show Many of the songs Nesmith wrote for the Monkees such as The Girl I Knew Somewhere Mary Mary songMary Maryref name0 and Listen to the Band songListen to the Band became minor hits One song he wrote You Just May Be the One is in mixed meter interspersing 54 bars into an otherwise 44 structure
 in 1967

Even before Colgems and Don Kirshners surreptitious release of the Monkees 2nd LP without the knowledge or consent of the four musicianactors they came to be frustrated by their studiomanufactured bubblegum image Within weeks of the release of More of the Monkees Nesmith lobbied successfully with the groups creators Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider that the Monkees be allowed to play their instruments on future records 
During a group meeting with Kirshner and Colgems lawyer Herb Moelis in a suite at the Beverly Hills Hotel each actor received a 250k royalties check yet Nesmith still threatened to quit Moelis rebuked him Youd better read your contract Nesmith defiantly punched a hole in the wall declaring to Moelis That could have been your face motherfucker Weeks later due to a breach of verbal agreement over the next single release which was promised to Nesmith by Rafelson  Schneider Nesmith led the charge in completely ousting musical supervisor Don Kirshner effectively giving the four youths complete artistic and production control of their output and the group finally worked as a true 4man rock group on 1967s Headquarters the Monkees albumHeadquarters despite Jones  Dolenz having very limited instrumental skills studio time being pricey and retakes costlyref nameSandoval Andrew 2001

During the bands first independent press conference Nesmith called their 2nd LP More of the Monkees probably the worst record in the history of the world partly due to rushed shoddy studio engineering The band took a hit to its artistic credibility when fans learned the four had not played all the instruments on the first 2 LPs But still sales continued to be profitable Headquarters sold 2 million copies down 2 million units from its predecessor but still reached the number 1 spot on Billboard falling only to Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band a week later and remaining 2 all through the entire 1967 Summer of Loveref nameSandoval Andrew 2001

For the remaining five Monkees LPs ironically the original Kirshner formula of hired studio musicians  songwriters again became the norm although Nesmith Tork Dolenz and Jones contributed about 50 of the original compositions Nesmith the majority of thoseref nameSandoval Andrew 2001
By the end of the Monkees run Nesmith was withholding many of his original song ideas from Monkees albums planning to release them in his postMonkees solo career 
Nesmiths last contractual Monkees commitment was a commercial for KoolAid and Nerf balls in April 1970 fittingly the spot ends with Nesmith frowning and saying Enerfs enerf As the bands sales declined Nesmith asked to be released from his contract despite it costing him I had three years left  at 150000 equivalent to 116 million in 2022 a year He remained in a financial bind until 1980 when he received his inheritance from his mothers estate In a 1980 interview with Playboy he said of that time I had to start telling little tales to the tax man while they were putting tags on the furniture
