Career
1967 Debut
Gentry recorded a demo at Whitney Recording Studio in Glendale California in February and March 1967 Her sole ambition originally was to write songs to sell to other artists telling The Washington Post that she only sang on the recording of Ode to Billie Joe that she took to Capitol because it was cheaper than hiring someone to sing itrefref

Gentrys second album The Delta Sweete was released in February 1968 In its musical ambition the album represented a decisive step beyond her debut This concept album drew inspiration from Gentrys Mississippi Delta roots Most of its sound comes from Gentry who played almost every instrument on its tracks including piano guitar banjo bass and vibes Nonetheless Capitols Kelly Gordon producer of Gentrys first work for the label also received the entire producing credit for The Delta Sweete The album earned Gentry two more entries on the Billboard Hot 100 Okolona River Bottom Band peaked at number 54 while her cover of Louisiana Man made it to number 100 Although the album failed to match the success of its predecessor only reaching number 132 on the Billboard 200 critics have called it one of the unacclaimed masterpieces of the 1960srefref

Around the time Patchwork was released the entire executive board that had been at Capitol throughout Gentrys career was fired A major restructuring at Capitol took place as parent company EMI tried to seize back control and rekindle the labels dwindling profits This saw the artist roster slashed from 247 to 81 alongside extensive cuts to production and marketing budgets With none of the executive board left that had known and worked with her negotiations stalled over the renewal terms of Gentrys contract and this failure to reach an agreement with Capitol created a stalemate Since Gentry was unwilling to release an album with Capitol on the terms offered she found herself unable to release an album on another label meaning she was left with no choice but to wait out the remaining option period of her contract

Davis was born Mary Frances Penick on December 30 1931 the first of seven children born to farmer William Lee and Sarah Rachel Penick née Roberts in Glencoe Kentuckyref However in her 1993 autobiography she states that she was in fact born in a small cabin along the bank of Eagle Creek KentuckyEagle Creek in Glencoe Kentucky Because her grandfather thought she had a lot of energy for a young child he nicknamed Mary Frances Skeeter slang for mosquito a name she carried for the rest of her life


When Davis was a toddler her greatuncle was convicted of murdering her maternal grandfather his brother in Indiana After this incident Davis recalled that her mother became a bitterly depressed woman Throughout her childhood Daviss mother made multiple suicide attempts several of which Davis herself prevented from being carried out I once slapped a bottle of BleachClorox she was drinking out of her mouth and sat on her hands to keep her from reaching for a butcher knife she recalled On one occasion her mother attempted to leap from the familys apartment window with Davis and her infant brother in her arms Her relationship with her mother remained strained throughout much of her life and by Daviss account she couldnt seem to win my mothers respect and affection so I turned my attention toward my daddy

In the mid1930s the Penick family relocated to Cincinnati Ohio where they remained for several years before returning to Dry Ridge They later moved to Erlanger Kentucky in 1947 Davis was raised a ProtestantismProtestant attending Christian Church Disciples of ChristDisciples of Christ churches As an adolescent Davis was inspired by the music of Betty Hutton and also developed interest in musicals memorizing songs from films such as Stage Door Canteen filmStage Door Canteen 1943 and Ill Be Seeing You 1944 filmIll Be Seeing You 1944 She would sometimes stage routines in her backyard dancing singing and telling ghost storyghost stories to neighborhood children When Davis was in seventh grade her father relocated to Oak Ridge Tennessee for work She and her siblings remained in the care of their mother who during this time became an alcoholismalcoholic In the summer of 1948 Davis and her family relocated to Covington Kentucky where her father was working as an electrician and moved into a house owned by the Villa Madonna Academy run by Order of Saint BenedictBenedictine nuns Davis became fascinated by the sisters and for a time considered becoming a nun

While attending Dixie Heights High School in Erlanger Skeeter met Betty Jack Davis and the two became close friends bonding over their love of music They began singing songs and playing guitar together during breaks at school which drew attention from their classmates and they performed in several school talent shows On a trip to the Grand Ole Opry the two convinced a stage manager to allow them backstage where they met Hank Williams and Chet Atkins

Career
19481956 The Davis Sisters rise to fame

During her junior year of high school Skeeter and Betty Jack Davis won a local yodeling contest whose prize was a time slot singing on a local daytime television show The two were billed as the The Davis Sisters country bandDavis Sisters with Skeeter adopting Betty Jacks last name despite their being unrelated Their appearance on the local program led to them receiving singing opportunities on the Detroit MichiganDetroit radio station WJRs program Barnyard Frolics After graduating from high school in 1949 Davis relocated to Detroit with Betty Jack where they completed demonstration recordings for Fortune Records among these were the song Jealous Love which was released as a single in 1953

RCA Victor producer Steve Sholes heard their demos and was impressed by their harmonies In the spring of 1953 Skeeter and Betty Jack met with Sholes at the RCA headquarters in New York City who offered them a recording contract After signing the contract they left New York to begin recording material in Nashville Tennessee On May 23 1953 they recorded I Forgot More Than Youll Ever Know a song that had previously been recorded by Sonny James The Davis Sisters toured regionally to support the single on live broadcast radio programs though Davis recalled that both were so insecure and uninformed about the music business The single was a significant success spending eight weeks at number one on the country charts in 1953 as well as making the top 20 on the pop charts The record ranks number 65 on the Top 100 Country Singles of All Time according to Billboard magazineBillboard historian Joel Whitburn

On August 1 1953 the Davis Sisters performed on the WWVA AMWWVA evening show in Wheeling West Virginia After midnight the two left Wheeling en route back to Covington Around 700 am on August 2 near Cincinnati a passing motorist fell asleep at the wheel crashing headon with the car in which Skeeter and Betty Jack Davis were riding Betty Jack was killed in the collision while Skeeter sustained serious head injuries The driver of the car also survived Newspaper bulletins at the time erroneously reported that both the Davis Sisters had been pronounced dead at Our Lady of Sorrow Hospital in Cincinnati

Following the accident Davis moved in with Betty Jacks mother Ollie while recovering from her injuries She recounted in her autobiography that Ollie took advantage of this tragic situation to suit her own ends alleging that she had kept Skeeter sedated with drugs administered from a local dentist and sequestered her in the house where she repeatedly played the girls records Once Skeeter recovered Ollie could hardly wait for her chance to recreate the Davis Sisters suggesting that Betty Jacks younger sister Georgia take her place in the singing duo Davis reluctantly agreed and six months after the accident she resumed singing in the duo with Georgia Davis In her autobiography she wrote that she felt she had been brainwashingbrainwashed by Ollie and coerced into resuming the musical duo

Between 1954 and 1956 Skeeter and Georgia released a total of nine singles for RCA as the Davis Sisters which they recorded in New York City and Chicago and toured the United States as a part of the RCA Caravan of the Stars alongside Minnie Pearl Hawkshaw Hawkins and Chet Atkins among others The singles recorded with Georgia were notably less successful than the duos former material with low chart positions though Davis felt that the material was good The two held a tribute performance for Betty Jack at the Grand Ole Opry in 1954 In 1955 the Davis Sisters were booked for a regional tour alongside Hank Snow The Carter Sisters minus June CarterJune and Elvis Presley Davis recounted her friendship with Presley in her autobiography The Davis Sisters formally disbanded in 1956 shortly after Daviss first marriage to Kenneth DePew

19571962 Early solo career

In the late 1950s during her marriage to DePew Davis suffered from clinical depressiondepression and harbored a death wish over the grief of Betty Jacks death as well as her contrived marriage She resumed performing as a solo act touring with Ernest Tubb and cowrote and recorded the song Set Him Free for RCA produced by Chet Atkins The song earned Davis a Grammy Award nomination for best country recording Sometime during this period  1958 Davis and DePew were divorced and she relocated to Nashville The same year Davis recorded Lost to a Geisha Girl an answer song to Hank Locklins hit Geisha Girl which reached the country number 15 and became her first solo hit Atkins worked with Davis as a guitarist on all of these sessions At Daviss suggestion Atkins frequently multipletracked Daviss voice for harmony vocals to resemble the sound of the Davis Sisters This echo can be found on several of her early solo hits such as Am I That Easy to Forget

She subsequently cowrote and recorded another top20 hit called Homebreaker which peaked at number 15 on the Hot Country Songs chart in November 1959refref The same year Davis joined the Grand Ole Opry During this time she toured with June Carter and the two became good friends

From 1960 to 1962 Davis had top10 hits with the songs I Cant Help You Im Falling Too My Last Date With You Where I Ought to Be and Optimistic Skeeter Davis songOptimistic I Cant Help You Im Falling Too marked Daviss first entrance as a solo artist onto the Billboard Billboard Hot 100pop charts in 1960 and resulted in her being invited to perform on Dick Clarks American Bandstand The song went all the way to the top 40 unheard of for a female country singer at the time In 1961 she scored a second pop hit with a lyric version written by Skeeter of Floyd Cramers instrumental country pop smash Last Date songLast Date called My Last Date With You which did even better making the top 30 on the pop charts  Both of these songs did exceptionally well on the Country musiccountry charts peaking at number two and number five respectively

Life and career

Eastons father died in 1969 and her mother had to support the family According to Eastons website despite her mothers heavy workload she was always available for her children Sheena always speaks very highly of her mum and the wonderful job she did in bringing up her and her siblings including teaching them all to read at home before they were even enrolled in schoolref nameOfficial website

Easton did not consider a singing career until she saw the movie The Way We Were with Barbra Streisand Streisands singing over the opening credits overtook the young girl and convinced her that what she wanted most was to be a singer and to have the same effect on othersrefref

Her top grades in school earned her a scholarship to attend the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in Glasgow where she trained from 1975 to 1979 as a speech and drama teacher by day while singing with a band called Something Else by night at local clubsref nameOfficial website She chose to study teaching rather than performing because it was a course of study that would let her perfect her craft as a singerref nameOfficial website

In 1979 she married Sandi Easton the first of her four husbands They divorced after eight months and Sheena decided to keep the surname Easton That year one of her tutors coaxed her into auditioning for Esther Rantzen producer of the BBC programme The Big Time TV seriesThe Big Time Rantzen was planning a documentary film to chronicle a relative unknowns rise to popmusic stardom Easton was selected as the subject for the programme EMI executives awarded her a contract and Christopher Neil was assigned as her recording producer Deke Arlon became her first manager and Easton spent much of 1980 being followed by camera crews who filmed her throughout the process of her audition through to making her first EMI single Modern Girl In the course of the filming she met and sang for Dorothy Squires Dusty Springfield and Lulu singerLulu whose manager Marion Massey told her that she saw Easton as a potential TV star with her own series but not as a pop singer for the 1980s as she lacked rugged individuality

The encounter with Massey then Marion London at which Lulu was present was filmed and included in the broadcast at which time Massey was not entirely incorrect as Modern Girl had flopped on its release peaking at number 56 in just three weeks on the UK Singles Chart in April 1980refref However once the programme aired in August 1980 Modern Girl was reissued and the track and its follow up Nine to Five both leapt into the top 10 disproving Masseys prediction In a revised and extended version of this episode of The Big Time broadcast in 1981 this special concluded with news of Eastons breaking into the American marketrefref

Bonnie Buckingham March 25 1923  January 12 2019refref better known as Bonnie Guitar was an American singer musician producer and businesswoman She was best known for her 1957 countrypop crossover hit Dark Moon songDark Moon She became one of the first female country music singers to have hit songs cross over from the country charts to the pop charts

She cofounded the record company Dolton Records in the late 1950s that launched the careers of The Fleetwoods and The Ventures In 1960 she left Dolton and became part owner of Jerden Records

Early life and rise to fame
Born in 1923 in Seattle Washington United Statesref nameLarkinref to John and Doris Buckingham Bonnie was initially raised in Redondo Des Moines WashingtonRedondo Beach along Puget Sound Later the family including her five siblings moved inland to a farm just outside the rural town of Auburn WashingtonAuburn She began performing at age 16 having taken up playing the guitar as a teenager which led to her stage name Bonnie Guitar She later started songwriting

In 1944 she married her former guitar teacher Paul Tutmarcrefrefrefref the couple had one daughter Paula born 1950 but split up in 1955 and Bonnie moved to Los Angeles Through much of the 1950s she worked as a session guitarist at quite a few small labels like Abbot Fabor and  Radio Recordersref nameLarkin

Working at these places got Guitar noticed as a professional guitarist as she ended up playing on sessions for many wellknown singers like Jim Reeves Dorsey Burnette Ned Miller and the DeCastro Sisters After working with so many singers she acquired her own singing aspirations herself and a desire to make her very own recording career in the process

Following the release of her first single If You See My Love Dancing on Fabor Records Bonnie heard a demo of Dark Moon from Fabors owner Fabor Robinson a tune written by Ned Miller with whom she worked as a session guitarist Robinson was dissatisfied with how Dorsey Burnette sang a version of it and offered it to Guitar I said Ill give up my royalties and everything just to do this song she told Robinson in recounting their collaboration on Dark Moon to Wayne Jancik in The Billboard Book of OneHit Wonders I knew it was up for grabs and somebody was gonna get it I got it but he took me at my word and I really did give up my royalties It was one of the hardest things I ever put together Ned Miller wrote it but we tried in maybe five or six different ways in different studios before it came out right The final version consisted of just two guitars and a bass backing BonnierefWayne Jancik The Billboard Book of OneHit Wonders expanded first edition Billboard Books 1998  p 35ref

The song was originally issued under Fabor Records in 1956 Dark Moon was then issued over to Dot Recordsref nameLarkin and by the spring of 1957 Dark Moon hit the pop top 10 list and went into the country top 15 list

Early music success in 1957

When Bonnies rendition of Dark Moon hit the country and pop charts in the Spring of 1957 she received recognition in the music business Not only was she one of the few female country singers at the time but she was also one of the few country singers that had a hit on the Country and Pop charts at the same time

Only one other female country singer was achieving this type of Crossover musiccrossover success Guitar was having at the time which was Patsy Cline when her single Walkin After Midnight was a Nonbsp2 Country hit and a Nonbsp12 Pop hit at the same time Dark Moon brought Guitar a wide audience and she was soon appearing on quite a few Pop Music programs Similar to Patsy Cline Bonnie could not followup her crossover success either Her followup to Dark Moon called Mister Fire Eyes failed to make a substantial impact on the Pop charts making it only to Nonbsp71 there On the Country charts though it was again a Top 15 hit Because she could not followup her crossover success her contract soon ended with Dot Records and Guitar returned to Washington US stateWashington

Running a record label and reentering country music in the 1960s

Guitar however decided she would form her very own record label called Dolton RecordsDolphin Records which she cofounded with refrigerator salesman Bob Reisdorff When the pair decided to rename the label Dolton Records they were forced to due an alreadyexisting Dolphin label name many of Guitars singles like Candy Apple Red and Born to Be With You were released In 1959 her own recording career was superseded by that of a high school trio called The Fleetwoods The trio was signed to the Dolton label and soon had major Pop Music hits in the Spring and Summer of 1959 with two Nonbsp1 hits Come Softly to Me and Mr Blueref nameLarkin

Soon another group called The Ventures were signed to Bonnies Dolton label They too had a monster hit called Walk Dont Run instrumentalWalk Dont Run However Guitar thought it was time she would get her own music career back on foot She soon left Dolton and went back to Dot Records where she recorded a series of country albums throughout the 1960s

In 1961 she appeared as herself on an episode of To Tell The Truth with Johnny Carson Ralph Bellamy Dina Merrill and Betty White as panelists Only White correctly identified her

In the summer and fall of 1963 she took a temporary leave to record a concept album under contract with Charter Records The album told a romantic story beginning with songs featuring themes about first sight through courting going steady threats from others getting engaged getting it broken off having the man marry someone else and finally having the woman live happily ever after on her own at the end Unfortunately the original heyday of concept albums by the likes of Frank Sinatra and Nat King Cole had long since been over by 1964 and the new times for concept albums by the likes of the Beatles and Pink Floyd were a few years off yet so the album was shelved Even though the album was never released commercially in its original format a single was released entitled Outside Looking In  however it failed to show on either the country or pop charts White label charter test pressings of the original concept album exist however and most of the songs on it found their way onto subsequent albums with the remaining material such as the country remake version of Dark Moon and Ned Millers Lucky Star being featured in a 1972 Paramount Records doublealbum compilation of her work

It was in 1966 that she began a brief stint as one of the most successful female soloists in the country music field Im Living in Two Worlds became Guitars first Top 10 Country hit the record also hit the pop Hot 100 She scored an even bigger country success in 1967 with the Nonbsp4 hit A Woman in Love Bonnie Guitar songA Woman in Love That same year she won the Academy of Country Musics Top Female Vocalist award In 1968 I Believe in Love Bonnie Guitar songI Believe in Love was another Top 10 hit Guitar teamed up with Buddy Killen and together they had a minor hit duet with A Truer Love Youll Never Find Than Mine which was issued in 1969 at a time when Guitars chart success was starting to faderef nameLarkin

Career
Following discharge from the military in 1953 Hazlewood did not return to his studiesref nameautorefref nameauto2ref He worked as a disc jockey in Coolidge Arizona and two years later moved to KRUX radio in Phoenix ArizonaPhoenix During that time he was already writing songs and formed his own record label Vivref nameauto

Hazlewood was initially known as a producer and songwriterref nameauto1ref His first hit single as a producer and songwriter was The Fool Sanford Clark songThe Fool sound recording and reproductionrecorded by rockabilly artist Sanford Clark in 1955

He partnered with pioneering rock guitarist Duane Eddyref namebbcobit  producing and cowriting a string of hit instrumental records Rebel Rouser released in 1958 was a hit in the US and in the UK Eddy would eventually have another 14 US hitsref nameauto including Peter Gunn songPeter Gunn Boss Guitar Forty Miles of Bad Road Shazam Duane Eddy songShazam and Dance With The Guitar Man

Hazlewood is perhaps best known for having written and produced the 1966 Nancy Sinatra USUK Nonbsp1 hit These Boots Are Made for Walkin and Summer Wine the latter first recorded with Suzi Jane Hokom in 1966

His collaboration with Nancy Sinatra began when Frank Sinatra asked Lee to help guide his daughters career When recording These Boots are Made for Walkin Hazlewood suggested to Nancy Sinatra you cant sing like Nancy Nice Lady any more You have to sing for the truckers She later described him as part Pygmalion playHenry Higgins and part Sigmund Freudref nameauto2

Hazlewood also wrote How Does That Grab Ya Darlin Fridays Child So Long Babe Sugar Town and many others for Sinatraref nameagerefref namebbcdies  Among his most wellknown vocal performances is Some Velvet Morning a 1967 duet with Sinatra He performed that song along with Jackson songJackson on her 1967 television special Movin With Nancy Early in 1967 Lee produced the number 1 hit song for Frank and Nancy Sinatra Somethin Stupid The pair became the only fatherdaughter duo to top the Hot 100 The record earned a Grammy Award nomination for Record of the Year and remains the only fatherdaughter duet to hit No 1 in the USrefref

Hazlewood wrote the theme song The Last of the Secret Agents the theme song of the The Last of the Secret Agents1966 spyspoof film of the same title Nancy Sinatra who had a role in the film recorded the song for the soundtrack For Frank Sinatras 1967 detective film Tony Rome Hazlewood wrote the theme song which was performed by Nancy

He wrote Houston songHouston a 1965 US hit recorded by Dean Martin He produced several singles for Martins daughter Deana Martin including her country hit Girl of the Month Club while Deana was a teenager Other tunes on that project were When He Remembers Me Baby I See You and The Bottom of My Mind all recorded during the 1960s

Hazlewood wrote This Town Frank Sinatra songThis Town a song that was recorded by Frank Sinatra that appeared on his 1968 album Frank Sinatras Greatest HitsGreatest Hits and is the basis for Paul Shaffers Small Town News segment theme on the Late Show with David Letterman

In 1967 Hazlewood started his own record label LHI Records Lee Hazlewood Industries Though it did not receive much attention at the time the International Submarine Band led by a thenunknown Gram Parsons signed with LHI in 1967 and released their one and only album Safe at Home Shortly after the album was recorded Parsons left the band to join The Byrds contributing several songs to their 1968 album Sweetheart of the Rodeo The contract Parsons had signed with Hazlewoods LHI caused a great deal of trouble for himself and The Byrds and in the court settlement most of Parsons material on Sweetheart of the Rodeo had the vocals removed and rerecorded by Roger McGuinn This situation led to Parsons departure from the Byrds not long after the albums release

As LHI producer and Hazlewoods exgirlfriend Suzi Jane Hokom later noted Hazlewood was a performer and not a businessman and his lack of business acumen figured greatly in the labels 1971 demise He had a supporting role in the movie The Moonshine War released in 1970 from a story by Elmore Leonard starring Patrick McGoohan Richard Widmark Alan Alda and Will Geer

In the 1970s Hazlewood moved to Stockholm where he wrote and produced the onehour television show Cowboy in Sweden together with friend and director Torbjörn Axelman which also later emerged as an albumrefref

During ten years in Sweden he made records and films with Axelman According to a retrospective of his career the move to Europe was motivated by his tax problems concern that his son might be drafted for the Vietnam War and the fact that his record label LHI was dying anyway so Sweden looked like the perfect escape route Decades later his friend Suzi Jane Hokom made this comment about the years in Europe I think he knew hed burned his bridges in LA and here was a brand new world where he had a builtin fanclub  He really needed a new startrefref

Throughout the late 1970s and 1980s Hazlewood was semiretired from the music business However his own output also achieved a cult status in the underground rock scene with songs recorded by artists such as Miles Kane Primal Scream Nick Cave the Jesus and Mary Chain The Ukiah Dragrefref Beck Baustelle the Tubes Thin White Rope Yonatan Gat Zeena SchreckRadio Werewolfrefrefrefref and Slowdiverefref

In 2006 Hazlewood sang on Bela Bs first solo album Bingo on the song Lee Hazlewood und das erste Lied des Tages Lee Hazlewood and the first song of the day He said that he loved producing and writing albumsrefhttpwwwharpmagazinecomarticlesdetailcfmarticle_id5098  ref

In 2007 RepriseRhino Handmade Records posthumously released Strung Out On Something New The Reprise Recordings a set of his work at Reprise from 19641968 excluding the Nancy Sinatra recordings The 2 CD collection totaling 55 tracks covers three of his solo albums as well as production work for other artists such as Duane Eddy Sanford Clark Jack Nitzsche and Dino Desi  Billyrefrefrefref

Since 2012 the Light in the Attic record label reissued many Hazlewood albums including 400 Miles From LA 19551956 which became available in September 2019ref nameauto1

Country recordings
Posey turned to the country music field in 1971 signing with Columbia Records with Billy Sherrill as producer Sherrill had just successfully turned another 1960s pop star Jody Miller into a leading country female vocalist and it appeared Posey might be another one when the first single Bring Him Safely Home to Me hit the top 20 However it was not to be with only two other singles barely scraping into the top 40 Posey signed with Monument Records in 1976 with just one single charting and later in the year moved to Warner Bros Records Her first single for the label inauspiciously peaked at Nonbsp93 but in 1978 and 1979 she charted three topnbsp30 country hits before this brief comeback faded away with the new decade

The story behind Mississippi
ref




Mississippi was another song composed by Werner Theunissen It was written in the same vein as Massachusetts Bee Gees songMassachusetts by the Bee Gees a song he liked very much  The band started to play the song live for a few months and later they sent a demo of it to EMI Bovema in Heemstede who were immediately interested  They ended up rerecording the song in the EMI Studio But this did not work out as planned Their producer at that time Eddy Hilberts who had success with a repertoire of country songs gave a country like twist to the song Personally the sisters did not have anything with country music although influenced by the Eagles bandEagles they liked country rockref name3 FM

Mississippi was released as a single in April 1975 Initially it did nothing until Meta de Vries the Dutch radio jockey started playing it  She thought Pussycat bandPussycat was an English band Hans Van Willigenburg played the song on his radio programme as well  During his broadcast he would play three new songs after which listeners could vote by postcard which artist should be invited to his studio  They voted for Pussycat  The group also performed the song for the TV show Herkent U Deze Tijd by Kick Stokhuyzen The same week the single entered the Top 40 in November 1975refref  The following week they performed Mississippi at TopPop and a week later the single had climbed to  1 Although Toni and Marianne still worked as typists for DSM they were unable to maintain their jobs as besides the Netherlands Mississippi had become No 1 in Germany as well As their fame grew the band realized they needed a manager so their record company got them their new manager Jan Buysref namePussycat Nostalgiaref

Oddly enough at first they did not want to release the single in  Germany nor UK because of the initial lack of interest Eventually the single was released in the UK on Sonet a small record label In the fall of 1976 the single was number 1 in the UK chartsrefref

In addition to the Netherlands Germany and UK the single was 1 in Austria Switzerland Norway and Brazil Though this song never became a hit in the United States it was covered by a number of American artists such as Barbara Fairchild and Lucille Starrrefref

1985  Going solo
