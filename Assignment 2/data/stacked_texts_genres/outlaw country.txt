Career
Early career

Upon his release from San Quentin in 1960 Haggard started digging ditches for his brothers electrical contracting company Soon he was performing again and later began recording with Tally Records The Bakersfield sound was developing in the area as a reaction against the overproduced Nashville sound Haggards first record for Tally was Singing My Heart Out backed by Skid Row it was not a success and only 200 copies were pressed In 1962 Haggard wound up performing at a Wynn Stewart show in Las Vegas ValleyLas Vegas and heard Wynns Sing a Sad Song He asked for permission to record it and the resulting single was a national hit in 1964 The following year he had his first national top10 record with My Friends Are Gonna Be Strangers written by Liz Anderson mother of country singer Lynn Anderson and his career was off and running Haggard recalls having been talked into visiting Andersona woman he did not knowat her house to hear her sing some songs she had written If there was anything I didnt wanna do it was sit around some danged womans house and listen to her cute little songs But I went anyway She was a pleasant enough lady pretty with a nice smile but I was all set to be bored to death even more so when she got out a whole bunch of songs and went over to an old pump organ There they were My God one hit right after another There must have been four or five number one songs there

In 1967 Haggard recorded Im a Lonesome Fugitive with The Strangers American bandthe Strangers also written by Liz Anderson with her husband Casey Anderson which became his first numberone singleref nameRS15ref When the Andersons presented the song to Haggard they were unaware of his prison stretch Bonnie Owens Haggards backup singer and thenwife is quoted by music journalist Daniel Cooper in the liner notes to the 1994 retrospective Down Every Road I guess I didnt realize how much the experience at San Quentin did to him cause he never talked about it all that much  I could tell he was in a dark mood  and I said Is everything okay And he said Im really scared And I said Why And he said Cause Im afraid someday Im gonna be out there  and theres gonna be  some prisoner  in there the same time I was in stand upand theyre gonna be about the third row downand say What do you think youre doing 45200 Cooper notes that the news had little effect on Haggards career Its unclear when or where Merle first acknowledged to the public that his prison songs were rooted in personal history for to his credit he doesnt seem to have made some big splash announcement In a May 1967 profile in Music City News his prison record is never mentioned but in July 1968 in the very same publication its spoken of as if it were common knowledgeref nameautogenerated1962ref

The 1967 album Branded Man with The Strangers American bandthe Strangers kicked off an artistically and commercially successful run for Haggard In 2013 Haggard biographer David Cantwell stated The immediate successors to Im a Lonesome FugitiveBranded Man in 1967 and in 68 Sing Me Back Home and The Legend of Bonnie and Clydewere among the finest albums of their respective years Haggards new recordings showcased his band the Strangers specifically Roy Nicholss Telecaster Ralph Mooneys steel guitar and the harmony vocals provided by Bonnie Owens

At the time of Haggards first top10 hit My Friends Are Gonna Be Strangers in 1965 Owens who had been married to Buck Owens was known as a solo performer a fixture on the Bakersfield CaliforniaBakersfield club scene and someone who had appeared on television She won the new Academy of Country Musics first ever award for Female Vocalist after her 1965 debut album Dont Take Advantage of Me hit the top five on the country albums chart However Bonnie Owens had no further hit singles and although she recorded six solo albums on Capitol between 1965 and 1970 she became mainly known for her background harmonies on Haggard hits such as Sing Me Back Home songSing Me Back Home and Branded Manrefref

Producer Ken Nelson took a handsoff approach to produce Haggard In the episode of American Masters dedicated to him Haggard remembers The producer I had at that time Ken Nelson was an exception to the rule He called me Mr Haggard and I was a little twentyfour twentyfiveyearold punk from Oildale He gave me complete responsibility I think if hed jumped in and said Oh you cant do that it wouldve destroyed meref nameAmericanMastersref In the documentary series Lost Highway Nelson recalls When I first started recording Merle I became so enamored with his singing that I would forget what else was going on and I suddenly realized Wait a minute theres musicians here youve got to worry about But his songshe was a great writerrefref

Towards the end of the decade Haggard composed several numberone hits including Mama Tried songMama Tried The Legend of Bonnie and Clyde Hungry Eyes and Sing Me Back Home Daniel Cooper calls Sing Me Back Home a ballad that works on so many different levels of the soul it defies ones every attempt to analyze itref nameautogenerated1962  In a 1977 interview in Billboard magazineBillboard with Bob Eubanks Haggard reflected Even though the crime was brutal and the guy was an incorrigible criminal its a feeling you never forget when you see someone you know make that last walk They bring him through the yard and theres a guard in front and a guard behindthats how you know a death prisoner They brought Rabbit out  taking him to see the Father  prior to his execution That was a strong picture that was left in my mind  In 1969 Haggards first tribute LP Same Train A Different TimeSame Train Different Time A Tribute to Jimmie Rodgers was also released to acclaim

In the 1969 Rolling Stone review for Haggard and the Strangers 1968 album Mama Tried Andy Wickham wrote His songs romanticize the hardships and tragedies of Americas transient proletarian and his success is resultant of his inherent ability to relate to his audience a commonplace experience with precisely the right emotional pitch Merle Haggard looks the part and sounds the part because he is the part Hes greatrefref

Okie from Muskogee and The Fightin Side of Me
In 1969 Haggard and the Strangers released Okie from Muskogee songOkie From Muskogee with lyrics ostensibly reflecting the singers pride in being from Middle America United StatesMiddle America where people are conventionally patriotic dont smoke marijuana dont take LSD dont protest by Draftcard burningburning draft cards or otherwise Antiauthoritarianismchallenge authorityrefMalone Bill Country Music USA 2nd rev ed University of Texas Press Austin 2002 p 371ref American president Richard Nixon wrote an appreciative letter to Haggard upon his hearing of the song and would go on to invite Haggard to perform at the White House several timesrefrefrefref

In the ensuing years Haggard gave varying statements regarding whether he intended the song as a humorous satire or a serious political statement in support of conservative valuesrefref In a 2001 interview Haggard called the song a documentation of the uneducated that lived in America at the time However he made several other statements suggesting that he meant the song seriously On the Bob Edwards Show he said I wrote it when I recently got out of the joint I knew what it was like to lose my freedom and I was getting really mad at these protesters They didnt know anything more about the war in Vietnam than I did I thought how my dad who was from Oklahoma would have felt I felt I knew how those boys fighting in Vietnam feltref namekaufmanref In the country music documentary series Lost Highway he elaborated My dad passed away when I was nine and I dont know if youve ever thought about somebody youve lost and you say I wonder what soandso would think about this I was drivin on Interstate 40 and I saw a sign that said 19 Miles to Muskogee while at the same time listening to radio shows of The World Tomorrow radio and televisionThe World Tomorrow hosted by Garner Ted Armstrongref nameChapelle2007ref Muskogee was always referred to in my childhood as back home So I saw that sign and my whole childhood flashed before my eyes and I thought I wonder what dad would think about the youthful uprising that was occurring at the time the Janis Joplins I understood em I got along with it but what if he was to come alive at this moment And I thought what a way to describe the kind of people in America that are still sittin in the center of the country sayin What is goin on on these campuses as it was the subject of this Garner Ted Armstrong radio program And a week or so later I was listening to Garner Ted Armstrong and Armstrong was saying how the smaller colleges in smaller towns dont seem to have any problems  And I wondered if Muskogee had a college and it did and they hadnt had any trouble  no racial problems and no dope problems The whole thing hit me in two minutes and I did one line after another and got the whole thing done in 20 minutesref nameChapelle2007 refref In the American Masters documentary about him he said Thats how I got into it with the hippies I thought they were unqualified to judge America and I thought they were lookin down their noses at something that I cherished very much and it pissed me off And I thought You sons of bitches youve never been restricted away from this great wonderful country and yet here you are in the streets bitchin about things protesting about a war that they didnt know any more about than I did They werent over there fightin that war any more than I wasref nameAmericanMasters 

Haggard began performing the song in concert in 1969 and was astounded at the reaction it received



The studio version which was mellower than the usually raucous liveconcert versions topped the country charts in 1969 and remained there for a month It also hit number 41 on the Billboard allgenre singles chart becoming Haggards biggest hit up to that time surpassed only by his 1973 crossover Christmas hit If We Make It Through December which peaked at number 28ref namehagbillboardchartp1  Okie from Muskogee is also generally described as Haggards signature songrefref

On his next single The Fightin Side of Me released by his record company in 1970 over Haggards objections Haggards lyrics stated that he did not mind the counterculture switchin sides and standin up for what they believe in but resolutely declared If you dont love it leave it In May 1970 Haggard explained to John Grissom of Rolling Stone I dont like their views on life their filth their visible selfdisrespect yknow They dont give a shit what they look like or what they smell like What do they have to offer humanity In a 2003 interview with No Depression magazineNo Depression magazine Haggard said I had different views in the 70s As a human being Ive learned more I have more culture now I was dumb as a rock when I wrote Okie From Muskogee Thats being honest with you at the moment and a lot of things that I said then I sing with a different intention now My views on marijuana have totally changed I think we were brainwashed and I think anybody that doesnt know that needs to get up and read and look around get their own information Its a cooperative government project to make us think marijuana should be outlawedrefref

Haggard had wanted to follow Okie from Muskogee with Irma Jackson a song that dealt with an interracial romance between a white man and an African American woman His producer Ken Nelson United States record producerKen Nelson discouraged him from releasing it as a singleref nameautogenerated1962  Jonathan Bernstein recounts Hoping to distance himself from the harshly rightwing image he had accrued in the wake of the hippiebashing Muskogee Haggard wanted to take a different direction and release Irma Jackson as his next single When the Bakersfield California native brought the song to his record label executives were reportedly appalled In the wake of Okie Capitol Records was not interested in complicating Haggards conservative bluecollar imageref nameRSref

After The Fightin Side of Me was released instead Haggard later commented to The Wall Street Journal People are narrowminded Down South they might have called me a nigger lover In a 2001 interview Haggard stated that Nelson who was also head of the country division at Capitol at the time never interfered with his music but this one time he came out and said Merle I dont believe the world is ready for this yet  And he might have been right I mightve canceled out where I was headed in my careerref nameautogenerated1962 ref nameRS 

Okie From Muskogee The Fightin Side of Me and I Wonder If They Think of Me Haggards 1973 song about an American POW in Vietnam were hailed as anthems of the silent majority and have been recognized as part of a recurring patriotic trend in American country music that also includes Charlie Daniels In America and Lee Greenwoods God Bless the USArefrefrefref Although Gordon Friesen of Broadside magazine criticized Haggard for his John Birch SocietynowikinowikiJohnnowikinowiki Birchtype songs against war dissenters Haggard was popular with college students in the early 1970s not only because of the ironic use of his songs by counterculture of the 1960scounterculture members but also because his music was recognized as coming from an early countryfolk tradition Both Okie from Muskogee and The Fightin Side of Me received extensive airplay on underground radio stations and Okie was performed in concert by protest songprotest singers Arlo Guthrie and Phil Ochsref namekaufman

 Career 
 Beginnings in music 
When Jennings was 8 his mother taught him to play guitar with the tune Thirty Pieces of Silver Jennings used to practice with his relatives instruments until his mother bought him a used Stella guitarStella guitar and later ordered a Harmony Company modelsPatricianHarmony Patrician Early influences included Bob Wills Floyd Tillman Ernest Tubb Hank Williams Carl Smith country musicianCarl Smith and Elvis Presleyref nameRolling Stoneref

Beginning with performing at family gatherings Jennings played his first public concert at the Youth Center with Anthony Bonanno followed by appearances at the local United States Junior ChamberJaycees and Lions Clubs InternationalLions Clubs He won a talent show at KLBKTVChannel 13 in Lubbock singing Hey Joe Carl Smith songHey Joe He later made frequent performances at the Palace Theater in Littlefield during local talent night

At age 14 Jennings auditioned for a spot on KVOW in Littlefield Texas Owner JB McShan along with Emil Macha recorded Jennings performance McShan liked his style and hired him for a weekly 30minute program Following his performance on the show Jennings formed his own band He asked Macha to play bass for him and gathered other friends and acquaintances to form the Texas Longhorns The style of the banda mixture of country and western and bluegrass musicwas often not well received


After several disciplinary infractions 16yearold Jennings was convinced to drop out of Littlefield High School by the superintendent Upon leaving school he worked for his father in the family store and also took temporary jobs Jennings felt that music would turn into his career The next year he along with the Texas Longhorns recorded demo versions of the songs Stranger in My Home and Therell Be a New Day at KFYO AMKFYO radio in Lubbock Meanwhile he drove a truck for the Thomas Land Lumber Company and a cement truck for the Roberts Lumber Company Tired of the owner Jennings quit after a minor driving accident Jennings and other local musicians often performed at country radio station KBZO AMKDAV  During this time he met Buddy Holly at a Lubbock restaurant The two often met during local shows and Jennings began to attend Hollys performances on KDAVs Sunday Party

In addition to performing on air for KVOW Jennings started to work as a DJ in 1956 and moved to Lubbock His program ran from 400 in the afternoon to 1000 in the evening filled with two hours of country classics two of current country and two of mixed recordings The latter included early rockandroll stars such as Chuck Berry and Little Richard The owner reprimanded Jennings for his selection and after playing two Little Richard records in a row Jennings was fired

During his time at KVOW Jennings was visited by DJ Sky Corbin of KLVT in Levelland Corbin was impressed with his voice and decided to visit Jennings at the station after hearing him sing a jingle to the tune of Hank Snows Im Moving On Hank Snow songIm Moving On Jennings expressed his struggle to live on a 50aweek salary Corbin invited Jennings to visit KLVT where he eventually took Corbins position when it openedrefref The Corbin family later purchased KLLL in Lubbock They changed the format of the station to country becoming the main competition of KDAV The Corbins hired Jennings as the stations first DJ


Jennings produced commercials and created jingles with the rest of the DJs As their popularity increased the DJs made public appearances Jenningss events included live performances During one performance Hollys father LO Holley approached them with his sons latest record and asked them to play it at the station LO mentioned his sons intention to start producing artists himself and Corbin recommended Jennings After returning from his tour of England Buddy Holly visited KLLLrefref

Holly took Jennings as his first artist He outfitted him with new clothes and worked with him to improve his imagerefref He arranged a session for Jennings at Norman Pettys recording studios in Clovis New Mexico On September 10 Jennings recorded the songs Jole Blon and When Sin Stops Love Begins with Holly and Tommy Allsup on guitars and saxophonist King Curtis Holly then hired Jennings to play bass for him during his Winter Dance Party Tour

 Winter Dance Party Tour 
Before the tour Holly vacationed with his wife in Lubbock and visited Jennings radio station in December 1958 Jennings and Sky Corbin performed the handclaps to Hollys tune Youre the One Jennings and Holly soon left for New York Cityrefref arriving on January 15 1959 Jennings stayed at Hollys apartment by Washington Square Park prior to a meeting scheduled at the headquarters of the General Amusement CorporationGeneral Artists Corporation which organized the tour They later took a train to Chicago to join the band

 with Buddy Holly on January 23 1959
The Winter Dance Party tour began in Milwaukee Wisconsin on January 23 1959 The amount of travel created logistical problems as the distance between venues had not been considered when scheduling each performance Adding to the problem the unheated tour buses twice broke down in freezing weather leading to drummer Carl Bunch being hospitalized for frostbite on his toes Holly made the decision to find another means of transportation

Before their performance at the Surf Ballroom in Clear Lake Iowa Holly chartered a fourseat Beechcraft Bonanza airplane from Dwyer Flying Service in Mason City Iowa for himself Jennings and Tommy Allsup to avoid the long bus trip to their next venue in Moorhead Minnesota Following the Clear Lake show which ended around midnight Allsup lost a coin toss and gave up his seat on the charter plane to Ritchie Valens while Jennings voluntarily gave up his seat to J P Richardson known as the Big Bopper who was suffering from the flu and complaining about how cold and uncomfortable the tour bus was for a man of his sizerefref

When Holly learned that his bandmates had given up their seats on the plane and had chosen to take the bus rather than fly a friendly banter between Holly and Jennings ensued and it would come back to haunt Jennings for decades to follow Holly jokingly told Jennings Well I hope your ol bus freezes up Jennings jokingly replied Well I hope your ol plane crashes Under 90 minutes later shortly after 100 am on February 3 1959 The Day the Music DiedHollys charter plane crashed into a cornfield outside Mason City instantly killing all on board

Later that morning Jennings family heard on the radio that Buddy Holly and his band had been killed After calling his family Jennings called Sky Corbin at KLLL from Fargo to confirm that he had not been aboard the planerefref The General Artists Corporation promised to pay for firstclass tickets for Jennings and the band to attend Hollys funeral in Lubbock in exchange for them playing that night in Moorhead After the first show they were initially denied their payment by the venue but after Jennings persistence they were paid The flights were never paid for and Jennings and Allsup continued the tour for two more weeks featuring Jennings as the lead singer They were paid less than half of the original agreed salary and upon returning to New York Jennings put Hollys guitar and amplifier in a locker in Grand Central Terminal and mailed the keys to Maria Elena Holly Then he returned to Lubbock

In the early 1960s Jennings wrote and recorded The Stage Stars in Heaven a tribute to Valens the Big Bopper and Holly as well as Eddie Cochran a young musician who died in a road accident a year after the plane crash

For decades afterward Jennings repeatedly stated that he felt responsible for the crash that killed Holly This sense of guilt precipitated bouts of substance abuse through much of his career

Jole Blon was released on Brunswick in March 1959 with limited successref nameRolling Stone  Now unemployed Jennings returned to KLLL Deeply affected by Hollys death Jennings performance at the station worsened He left the station after he was denied a raise and later worked briefly for the competition KDAV

 Phoenix 
Due to his fatherinlaws illness Jennings had to shuttle between Arizona and Texas While his family lived back in Littlefield Jennings found a job briefly at KODMKOYL in Odessa Texas He moved with his family to Coolidge Arizona where his wife Maxines sister lived He found a job performing at the Galloping Goose bar where he was heard by Earl Perrin who offered him a spot on KCKY Jennings also played during the intermission at drivein theaters and in bars After a successful performance at the Cross Keys Club in Phoenix ArizonaPhoenix he was approached by two contractors Paul Pristo and Dean Coffman who were building a club in Scottsdale ArizonaScottsdale for James Jimmy D Musil called JDs Musil engaged Jennings as his main artistref namepnt with Jennings noted to be at the construction site  httpswwwphoenixnewtimescommusicrequiemforanoutlaw6413445 Requiem for an Outlaw Phoenix New Times February 21 2002ref and designed the club around his act

Jenningss records found little success at AM because the label was releasing mostly folk music rather than country at the time He had a few regional hits around Phoenix due to local radio airplay with  Four Strong Winds and Just To Satisfy You which was cowritten with Bowman Meanwhile he recorded an album on BAT records produced by James Musil and engineered by Jack Miller called JDs Waylon Jennings on the front of the album and Waylon Jennings at JDs on the back side After 500 copies were sold at the club another 500 were pressed by the Sounds labelrefCountry Music Foundation p 53ref He also played lead guitar for Patsy Montana on a 1964 album

During this time Jennings rented an apartment in Nashville with singer Johnny Cash Jennings and Cash were both managed by Lucky Moellers booking agency Moeller Talent Inc The tours organized by the agency were unproductive with the artists being booked to venues located far from each other in close dates After paying for the accommodation and travel expenditures Jennings was frequently forced to request advances from the agency or RCA Victor to make the next venue While playing 300 days on the road Jenningss debt increased and along with it his consumption of amphetamine He believed himself to be trapped on the circuit

In 1972 Jennings released Ladies Love Outlaws Waylon Jennings albumLadies Love Outlaws The single that headlined the album became a hit for Jennings and was his first approach to outlaw country Jennings was accustomed to performing and recording with his own band Waymores Outlawsthe Waylors a practice that was not encouraged by powerful Nashville producers who favored the Nashville sound produced by a roster of experienced local studio musicians The music style publicized as countrypolitan was characterized by orchestral arrangements and the absence of most traditional country music instruments The producers did not let Jennings play his own guitar or select material to record Jennings felt limited by Nashvilles lack of artistic freedom

 Music career 

 Early career 19701975 

Early in 1970 Coe released his debut album Penitentiary Blues followed by a tour with Grand Funk Railroadref nameBrennan  In October 1971 he signed as an exclusive writer with Pete and Rose Drakes publishing company Windows Publishing Company Inc in Nashville Tennessee where he remained until 1977 Although he developed a cult following with his performances he was not able to develop any mainstream success but other performers achieved charting success by recording songs Coe had written including Billie Jo Spears 1972 recordings Souvenirs  California Memrys and Tanya Tuckers 1973 single Would You Lay With Me In a Field of Stone which was a No 1 hit and responsible for Coe becoming one of Nashvilles hottest songwriters and Coe himself being signed by Columbia Recordsref nameBrennan  Coe recorded his own version of the song for his second Columbia album Once Upon a Rhyme released in 1975ref nameAllmusicRhyme  AllMusic writer Thom Jurek said of the song The amazing thing is that both versions are definitiveref nameAllmusicRhymeref

Unlike Coes first two albums his third showed full commitment to country music and Coe would play a part in the evolution of what would become known as outlaw country The title of Coes third album The Mysterious Rhinestone Cowboy refers to the gimmick Coe adopted several years before Glen Campbell had a hit with the song Rhinestone Cowboy dressing up in a rhinestone suit and wearing a Lone Ranger mask The singer later recalled to Michael Buffalo Smith in 2004 I guess I have to blame it on Mel Tillis I met him when I first went to Nashville and he had an office down on Music Row I was over there talking to him in his office and he opened up the closet to get something and he had a whole closet full of rhinestone suits I just freaked out on that He looked at me and said You like that shit I dont even wear those if you want em take em He gave me those rhinestone suits and I wore them everywhereref nameswamplandref Coe maintained the idea for the mask came from his father



Coes second album Once Upon a Rhyme contains one of his biggest hits You Never Even Called Me by My Name written by Steve Goodman and John Prine and which first appeared on Goodmans 1971 debut release Coes version became his first country Top 10 hit single peaking at No 8 in 1975 and includes a spoken epilogue where Coe relates a correspondence he had with Goodman who stated the song he had written was the perfect country and western song Coe wrote back stating that no song could fit that description without mentioning a laundry list of clichés mama or trains or trucks or prison or getting drunk Goodmans equally facetious response was an additional verse that incorporated all five of Coes requirements and upon receiving it Coe acknowledged that the finished product was indeed the perfect country and western song and included the last verse on the record

blockquoteWell I was drunk the day my mom got out of prisonbrAnd I went to pick er up in the rainbrBut before I could get to the station in my pickup truckbrShe got runned over by a damned ol trainblockquote

Coe was a featured performer in Heartworn Highways a 1975 documentary film by James Szalapski Other performers featured included Guy Clark Townes Van Zandt Rodney Crowell Steve Young musicianSteve Young Steve Earle and the Charlie Daniels Band Coe also wrote Cocaine Carolina for Johnny Cash and sang background vocals on the recording that appeared on Cashs 1975 album John R Cash albumJohn R Cash

 Outlaw years 19761982 

By 1976 the outlaw country movement was in full swing as artists such as Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson were finally enjoying massive commercial success after years of fighting to record their music their own way Coe however was still somewhat an outsider almost too outlaw for the outlaws a predicament summed up well by AllMusic

ref

Longhaired Redneck was Coes third album for Columbia in three years and the first where he wrote or cowrote all the songs the outlaw country zeitgeist was summed up well in the title track which recounts playing in a dive where bikers stare at cowboys who are laughing at the hippies who are praying theyll get out of here alive  The song features Coe impersonating the vocal styles of Ernest Tubb Bill Anderson singerBill Anderson and Merle Haggard  About the term Longhaired Redneck Coe later said It was terminology that Id made up at the time I was trying to tell people that not everybody with long hair was a hippie Not everyone was the kind of person that thought you could punch them out take their money and that theyd say I wont do nothin about itref namereviewmagref

By 1977 the outlaw movement was nearing its apex having seen the release of Willie Nelsons blockbuster album Red Headed Stranger and country musics first platinum selling album Wanted The Outlaws Coe considered himself as integral as anyone in the evolution of the outlaw country genre and began saying so in his music As noted in AllMusics review of the album On Rides Again David Allen Coe albumRides Again by trying to make a conscious outlaw record and aligning himself with the movements two progenitors on the opening track Willie Waylon and MeCoe already set up selfparody unintentionally  something that continued to curse himref nameAllmusic  The songs on Rides Again crossfade without the usual silences between tracks which was unusual for country music and feature Coes heavily Phaser effectphased guitar Coe was also permitted to use his own band on several tracks a major concession for Columbia at the time However some of his peers resented Coe placing himself in such exalted company and felt he was exploiting his relationship with his fellow outlawsref namestreissref Jennings drummer Richie Albright called Coe a great great songwriter A great singer But he could not tell the truth if it was better than a lie hed made up Waylon didnt make him comfortable enough to hang around But Willie did I was around Willie quite a bit and David Allan was with him eighty percent of the time  Willie allowed him to hang aroundref namestreiss Coe managed to maintain friendships with both Jennings and Nelson despite the formers cool treatment of him at times In his autobiography Jennings mentions Coe once in a chapter titled The Outlaw Shit calling him the most sincere of the bunchref namejenniref of bandwagon jumpers but contends when it came to being an Outlaw the worst thing he ever did was doubleparking on Music Rowref namejenni adding



Throughout the rest of the decade Coe released a string of strong recordings some of which such as Human Emotions 1978 and Spectrum VII 1979 were concept albums with each side of the discs given their own theme 1978s Family Album David Allan Coe albumFamily Album contains Coes rendition of Take This Job and Shove It a song he composed and which had been released by Johnny Paycheck in October 1977 becoming a monumental success The song is a first person account of a man who has worked for fifteen years with no apparent reward and it struck a chord with the public even inspiring a 1981 film of the same name Although Coes name was credited the assumption by many was that Paycheck an acclaimed songwriter himself composed the tune this would feed into Coes growing bitterness with the industry as another one of his peers exploded in popularity Coe was further disenchanted when pop star Jimmy Buffett accused him of plagiarising his hit Changes in Latitudes Changes in Attitudes for Coes Divers Do It Deeper Coe had been incorporating Caribbean sounds into his music as is evident on his 1979 album Compass Point David Allan Coe albumCompass Point By 1980 Coe and producer Billy Sherrill set out to reach a wider audience and bring Coe back to the charts by inviting other singers and musicians to take part in the sessions for what would become Ive Got Something to Say which would boast contributions from Guy Clark Bill Anderson singerBill Anderson Dickey Betts from The Allman Brothers Band Kris Kristofferson Larry Jon Wilson and George Jones This process was continued the following year on Invictus Means Unconquered with Sherrill couching the songs in tasteful instrumentation that put the spotlight squarely on Coes voice In his AllMusic review Thom Jurek labelled it arguably the finest album of his careerref nameAllmusic 

By 1981 the outlaw country movement waned as the slicker urban cowboy era took hold in country music typified by the Johnny Lee singerJohnny Lee hit Lookin for Love which critic Kurt Wolff panned as an example of watereddown cowboy musicrefWolff Kurt Country Music The Rough Guide Rough Guides Ltd London Penguin Putnam New York distributor p 424 ref Coe was an important figure in the outlaw country genre but judging by the sound of his recordings from this period he had no interest in the trendy urban cowboy phase Refusing to give into the flavorofthemonth generic country talent Coe stuck to what he knew and sharpened the edgesref nameAllmusic  However while scoring some moderate hits mainstream success remained elusive Coes highest charting single during this period was Get a Little Dirt on Your Hands a duet with Bill Anderson which peaked at No 45 As if aware of the compromises he had been making Coe chose to close out his 1982 album DAC with a suite of three songs that contained a short prologue



 Commercial success 19831989 
Castles in the Sand would be a huge comeback for Coe peaking at No 8 on the country albums chart his highest showing since Once Upon a Rhyme hit the same mark eight years earlier Its success was spurred on by The Ride which was released in February 1983 as the lead single from the album and reached No 1 on the June 4 Cashbox magazineCashbox Country Singles Chartrefref It spent 19 weeks on the Billboard country singles charts reaching a peak of No 4 and hitting No 2 on the Canadian RPM Country Tracks chart The ballad musicballad tells the firstperson story of a hitchhikers encounter with the ghost of Hank WilliamsHank Williams Sr in a ride from Montgomery Alabama to Nashville Tennesseeref namebillboardBillboard magazineBillboard March 19 1983ref The mysterious driver dressed like 1950 half drunk and holloweyed questions the narrator whether he has the musical talent and dedication to become a star in the country music industry The songs lyrics place the events on US Route 31 or the largely parallel Interstate 65 Buoyed by the single Castles in the Sand became the mainstream breakthrough that Coe and producer Billy Sherrill had been trying for since the decade began 1984s Just Divorced contains Coes second biggest chart hit Mona Lisa Lost Her Smile which rose to No 2 on the Billboard country singles chart and No 3 on Cashboxrefhttpswebarchiveorgweb20181012224141httpcashboxmagazinecomarchiveschtm ref In Canada it reached No 1 on the RPM magazineRPM Country Tracks charts dated for June 30 1984refref  The song is a midtempo ballad about a young blonde girl featuring allusions to the Mona Lisaiconic Da Vinci painting The song features one of producer Billy Sherrills most elaborate productions with one critic commenting The layered strings and organ work are slick but they add such warmth and depth in contrast to Coes voice that it works to devastating effectref nameAllmusic   Another track Missin the Kid finds a father lamenting the loss of his daughter who now lives with his estranged exwife  Over a languid beat and using simple language Coe delivers a stunning vocal that expresses with weary resignation the bitterness guilt and extreme sadness that comes with a broken family Beginning with the line I still cant believe after all of these years I still miss you the narrator wonders what his wife will tell their daughter when she asks about him and finally declares

I tell myself that its best if I dont try to see her
Seeing her now could not make up for all shes been through
Watching two people she once called her mother and father
Acting like strangers thats something I just could not do

In his AllMusic review of the album writer Thom Jurek writes



She Used to Love Me a Lot was released in December 1984 and peaked at No  11 on both the US Billboard Hot Country Singles chart and the Canadian RPM Country Tracks chart A version of the song by Johnny Cash was recorded in the early 1980s but remained unreleased until 2014refref The song tells of a chance meeting between two exlovers at the Silver Spoon Café but when the man tries to rekindle the romance she dismisses him in the same cavalier way he did her years earlier It was written by Dennis Morgan songwriterDennis Morgan Charles Quillen and Kye Fleming as Coe  who continued to write songs of high quality  nonetheless relied on outside writers to get him in the charts The 1986 album Son of the South David Allan Coe albumSon of the South would include contributions from fellow outlaw legends Nelson Jennings and Jessi Colter His final recording for Columbia the concept album A Matter of Lifeand Death was released in 1987

 Outlaw origins 

Coes integrity was called into question after his previous claim that he had spent time on death row for killing an inmate who tried to rape him was debunked when a Texas documentarian discovered Coe had done time for possessing burglary tools and indecent materials  but never murderref namestreiss Criticisms such as these notwithstanding Coe always maintained he was integral to the outlaw country movement getting its name stating in 2003

 Coe was uncompromising when it came to his lifestyle and language even though it kept him off country playlists and award shows For example The House Weve Been Calling Home from the 1977 album Rides Again explores the theme of polygamy me and my wives have been spending our lives in a house weve been calling a home while on the final cut on the album If That Aint Country Ill Kiss Your Ass Coe utters a racial slur on record for the first time singing the line workin like a nigger for my room and board The song paints a picture of a Texas family that verges on caricature with the narrator describing his tattooed father as veteran proud and deeming his oldest sister a firstrate whore The song further alienated Coe from the country mainstream and kickstarted accusations that he was a racist a charge he always vehemently denied In 2004 he remarked



The cover of the 1986 release Son of the South which displayed Coe holding a baby with a Confederate flag draped over his shoulders galled many industry insiders although Coe did print a message on the back of the album to defuse any potential backlash



In another interview Coe said Anyone that would look at me and say I was a racist would have to be out of their mind I have dreadlocks down to my waist with earrings in both ears and my beard is down to my waist and it is in braidsI was in prison with 87 black people I hung around with black people and I learned to sing music with black people It was ironic that in prison the white guys called me a nigger lover and now I write the word nigger in a song and I am all of a sudden a racist It is pretty ironicref nameswampland
