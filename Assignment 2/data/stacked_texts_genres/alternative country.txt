Whiskeytown was an American alternative country band formed in 1994 from Raleigh North Carolina Fronted by Ryan Adams the group included members Caitlin Cary Phil Wandscher Eric Skillet Gilmore and Mike Daly They disbanded in 2000 with Adams leaving to pursue his solo career Whiskeytown gradually expanded its sound outside the confines of alternative country while still maintaining its alternative roots

The band released three albums No two albums shared a consistent lineup Adams and Cary remained the only constants

 History 
After performing punk rock with a band called The Patty Duke Syndrome Adams founded Whiskeytown in 1994 in Raleigh North Carolina The music of countryrock artist Gram Parsons served as his inspiration The band initially consisted of Adams violinist Caitlin Cary drummer Eric Skillet Gilmore bassist Steve Grothmann and guitarist Phil Wandscherref nameGuardian2001ref

 Faithless Street era 19951996 
Faithless Street released on Mood Food Records in 1995 established the band as one of the genres leaders thanks to glowing reviews in publications such as No Depression periodicalNo Depression and helped the band score a majorlabel record deal with the Geffen Records imprint Outpost

Faithless was rereleased on the imprint in 1998 with nearly a dozen bonus tracks from the era Among the bonus tracks were previously unreleased tracks and tracks that had been released on earlier albums and EPs including Strangers Almanac and Rural Free Delivery EPRural Free Delivery One track Oklahoma was removed Adams claimed that the reason for the rerelease was the muddy sound of the original version and his distaste for Oklahoma which was added to the album despite his objectionsrefref

 Strangers Almanac era 19971998 
Whiskeytowns 1997 majorlabel debut Strangers Almanac helped to establish Adams reputation as a songwriter In the midst of the albums recording Gilmore and Grothman left and Wandscher left soon after the albums release The band cycled through numerous members throughout the next year including Jeff Rice and Steven Terry both of whom were involved in the recording of Almanac but left later that year

The bands reputation preceded it in the live setting In a 1997 Detroit Free Press article titled Whiskeytown half band half soap opera a June 1997 show at Macs Bar in Lansing Michigan was described by fans as a halfbaked performancerefref

Despite the bands internal strife Almanac was a successful album with critics with the tracks 16 Days and the Replacementsesque Yesterdays News receiving significant radio play The positive reviews came from increasingly mainstream publications such as Rolling Stone who claimed at the time If theres to be a Nirvana bandNirvana among the bands that are imprecisely dubbed alternative country look to Whiskeytownrefhttpswwwrollingstonecomartistswhiskeytownalbumsalbum100139review5940837strangers_almanac ref  In January 1998 the band taped a live performance for Austin City Limitsrefref

During the tour for Strangers Almanac most of the band was fired or quit at a concert in Kansas City The only people who started and finished the tour were Adams Caitlin Cary Mike Daly and tour manager Thomas OKeeferefref

 Pneumonia and the bands demise 19992001 
The band managed to add a new core member in multiinstrumentalist Mike Daly who contributed significantly to the bands sound on their third album Pneumonia albumPneumonia

The albums recording was a much different affair from the first twolikely because of the bands constantly changing dynamic The traditional country of the first two albums especially Faithless was largely replaced with a more sophisticated countryrooted pop sound very similar to Wilcos 1999 album Summerteeth Also adding to the different flavor of the album was a cast of guest stars including The Replacements bandThe Replacements Tommy Stinson and The Smashing Pumpkins James Iha

Despite the albums completion and Whiskeytowns sizable fanbase Outpost Records closed during the merger between Polygram and Universal and as a result the album stayed in limbo for nearly two years effectively ending the bandrefref

Lost Highway Records the rootsminded label imprint of Universal Music picked up the album after signing Adams who in the interim recorded his highly acclaimed debut solo record Heartbreaker Ryan Adams albumHeartbreaker on indie label Bloodshot Records and released it in May 2001 

 PostWhiskeytown and talk of reunion 
Since the band dissolved most core members have chosen to remain active in music Cary who married original drummer Eric Skillet Gilmore has released three solo albums and created a female folk trio named Tres Chicasrefhttpswwwrollingstonecomnewsstory5935412cary_strikes_up_tres_chicas ref In 2010 she formed a duo group called The Small Pondsrefref with Matt Douglas of Raleigh band The Proclivities In 2013 Cary and solo artist Jon Lindsay musicianJon Lindsay cofounded the httpwwwncmusiclovearmyorg NC Music Love Army  a collective of many notable musicians from North Carolina who oppose the leadership of the newly emerged Republican supermajority in their home state Between 2013 and 2014 the group has put out nine releases on their own label Love Army Records as well as thru Redeye Distribution and Bloodshot Records

Adams has remained in the spotlight since the bands breakup releasing numerous solo albums including three in 2005 In 2004 Adams founded Ryan Adams and The Cardinals an alternative rock band The band released several albums before disbanding in 2009ref nameRollStone2008ref He has drawn considerable praise from such legends as Elton John and Phil Lesh for his songwritingrefref  In February 2001 original Whiskeytown guitarist Phil Wandscher joined Adams at a Seattle show to perform two songs  It was the first time the two had appeared onstage together in 3½ yearsrefref

Adams and Cary have claimed to be reuniting Whiskeytown on multiple occasions as recently as 2010 but nothing new has been released yet He told an interviewer in January 2017 that he was writing a book about the band but had no plans to record or tour with Whiskeytownref nameJamBase17ref A scheduling conflict was blamed as the reason for the reunion not taking place The band did reunite for a oneoff impromptu gig after one of Adams shows in Raleigh NC in 2005 Gilmore Cary and Adams were joined onstage by Adams pedal steel player Jon Graboff and bassist Catherine Popperrefref

Uncle Tupelo was an alternative country music group from Belleville Illinois active between 1987 and 1994 Jay Farrar Jeff Tweedy and Mike Heidorn formed the band after the lead singer of their previous band The Primitives left to attend college The trio recorded three albums for Rockville Records before signing with Sire Records and expanding to a fivepiece Shortly after the release of the bands major label debut album Anodyne albumAnodyne Farrar announced his decision to leave the band due to a soured relationship with his cosongwriter Tweedy Uncle Tupelo split on May 1 1994 after completing a farewell tour Following the breakup Farrar formed Son Volt with Heidorn while the remaining members continued as Wilco

Although Uncle Tupelo broke up before it achieved commercial success the band is renowned for its impact on the alternative country music scenerefref The groups first album No Depression albumNo Depression became a byword for the genre and was widely influential Uncle Tupelos sound was unlike popular country music of the time drawing inspiration from styles as diverse as the hardcore punk of The Minutemen bandThe Minutemen and the country instrumentation and harmony of the Carter Family and Hank Williams Farrar and Tweedys lyrics frequently referred to Middle America United StatesMiddle America and the working class of Belleville

 History 

 The Plebes and The Primitives 
Jay Farrar along with his brothers Wade and Dade played in an early 1980s garage band named The Plebes Hailing from Belleville Illinois The Plebes sought to enter a battleofthebands competition but needed another high school student as a member to perform They invited Jeff Tweedy a high school friend of Jay Farrar to join the band and play with them for the show Despite a lack of skill with his instrument Tweedy played an important role in the band by booking early gigs While The Plebes had been playing music in a rockabilly style Tweedy wanted to play punk rock like the music that he originally heard the group perform This caused tensions between Tweedy and Dade Farrar who left the band two months after Tweedy joined

Before leaving the band in 1984 Dade Farrar introduced its members to Mike Heidorn the younger brother of his girlfriend Heidorn then joined the group as their drummerref nameliner  The Plebes then decided to change its name to The Primitives a reference to a 1965 song by psychedelic rock group The GroupiesrefThe band was also known as The Primatives due to a misprint on their business cardsref Due to the unpopularity of punk rock in the St Louis area The Primitives began to play bluesoriented garage rock at fast tempos They performed regularly at a wedding hall in Millstadt Illinois where Tweedys mother Jo Ann would collect the cover feeref nameliner  They also performed regularly at B St Bar in Belleville with bands such as The Newsboys later Sammy and the Snowmonkeys Charlie Langrehr and The Symptoms Wade Farrar was the lead singer of the band but his commitment to Southern Illinois University and an attempted enlistment in the United States Army meant he was only able to dedicate a small amount of time to the group Additionally Heidorn broke his collarbone during a concert in 1986 which caused the band to go on hiatus Jay Farrar and Tweedy continued to write songs and perform at Heidorns house while he recovered and by 1987 they had restarted the group The Primitives temporarily added Tony Mayr as a bassist so that Tweedy could play guitar but a month later the band decided to keep Tweedy on bass and remain a threepieceref nameliner  To avoid confusion with a successful British band also named The Primitives they decided to change their name once again to Uncle Tupeloref namePopM  Although they performed only 1960s cover songs as The Primitives the trio decided to take a new approach and write their own music under their new nameref namePD 

 As Uncle Tupelo 

The Primitives renamed themselves Uncle Tupelo a name  created by combining two randomly chosen words from the dictionary Inspired by the name cartoonist Chuck Wagner a friend of the band created a character resembling an old fat Elvis Presleyref nameliner  The trio recorded a foursong demo tape which got them supporting slots opening for headline artists such as Johnny Thunders and Warren Zevonref nameliner  Tweedy met Tony Margherita while working as a clerk at Euclid Records in St Louis After attending two of the bands shows Margherita offered to become their manager Uncle Tupelo began to play regular shows at Ciceros Basement  a bar close to the campus of Washington University in St Louis Bands playing in a similar style including Brian Hennemans group Chicken Truck often played at the venue which by late 1988 was considered the locus of a new music scene The band temporarily expanded to a fourpiece with the addition of the guitarist Alex Mutrux but soon reverted to a trioref nameliner 

Uncle Tupelo recorded demo tracks in the attic studio of future Chicago punk producer Matt Allison in Champaign Illinois The demo distributed with the title Not Forever Just for Now includes I Got Drunk and Screen Door as well as early versions of several other songs that would appear on the bands first studio album The College Media JournalCMJ New Music Report gave the tape a rave review and called Uncle Tupelo the best unsigned band of the year The accolade drew the attention of independent labels and the band decided to sign with Jay Fialkov and Debbie SouthwoodSmith of Giant Records independent labelGiant Records who offered to book them at CBGB in New York Cityrefref Explaining the decision the band said that our original goals dont get distorted with an independent labelref Last accessed June 8 2007ref

 Recordings on Rockville Records 

Shortly after Uncle Tupelos signing Giant Records changed its name to Rockville Records The bands first album for Rockville No Depression albumNo Depression was recorded over ten days in January 1990 at Fort Apache South recording studio in Boston Massachusetts The albums thematic structure revolved around their lives as adolescents in Belleville examples are songs about wanting to avoid factory work and songs about fearing a potential Gulf WarPersian Gulf War military draftrefref Impressed by their previous work on Dinosaur Jrs Bug Dinosaur Jr albumBug the band wanted Paul Kolderie and Sean Slade to produce the album Slade let Farrar play on the same 1961 Gibson Les Paul JuniorGibson Les Paul SG Junior that J Mascis originally played on Bug The album was released on June 21 1990 and the band celebrated by playing at Ciceros for two nights

In between tours Farrar Tweedy and Heidorn formed a country cover band named Coffee Creek along with Brian Henneman later a member of The Bottle Rockets Henneman impressed Uncle Tupelo and he was invited to be a guitar technician and occasional multiinstrumentalist for the band While Farrar and Heidorn would avoid drinking too much after shows Tweedy would continue drinking throughout the night Although Tweedy stopped after he began dating Sue Miller in 1991 a significant communication gap had already been opened between Tweedy and Farrar

By March 1991 No Depression had sold an estimated 15000 copies and was featured in a Rolling Stone article about rising starsref nameliner  However Rockville Records refused to pay the band any royalties for the album a theme that would continue for the remainder of the bands contract Over seventeen days the band recorded a second album at Long View Farm in rural North Brookfield Massachusetts Still Feel Gone with a more layered sound was also produced by Kolderie and Slade with contributions by Slade Henneman Rich Gilbert Chris Bess of Enormous Richard and Gary Louris of The Jayhawks The band was disappointed with the production of the album and decided to discontinue working with Kolderie and Slade Soon afterward Uncle Tupelo recorded Shaking Hands Soldiers Joy on Michelle Shockeds album Arkansas Traveler Michelle Shocked albumArkansas Traveler and joined her on the accompanying tour with Taj Mahal musicianTaj Mahal and The Band However the tour only lasted for a few shows because of managerial problems between Shocked and The Bandref namelast refrefref nameCST 

Alternative rock had broken into the mainstream by 1992 and an album released in that style was expected to earn the group a majorlabel record deal However Uncle Tupelo did not want to follow in the footsteps of groups such as Nirvana bandNirvana and decided to play country musiccountry and folk songs as a big fuck you to the rock scene Peter Buck guitarist for REM saw the trio perform at the 40 Watt Club in Athens Georgia and sought them out after the show Buck was impressed with a version of Atomic Power that the band played and offered his services for their next album Over a span of five days Buck produced the groups next album March 1620 1992 Buck allowed them to stay in his house during the sessions and charged no money for his services Hennemans role was increased for this album and he taught himself how to play mandolin and bouzouki Despite turning away from the style of popular alternative rock major labels began to show significant interest in Uncle Tupelo after March 1620 1992 was released The album sold more than their two previous recordings combined although Rockville was displeased that it did not conform to the style of popular alternative rockrefref

 Major label contract 
In 1992 Joe McEwen of Sire Records began to pursue the band McEwen who brought notable acts such as Dinosaur Jr and Shawn Colvin to Sire had been interested in them since hearing the Not Forever Just for Now demo tape At the urging of Gary Louris McEwen offered Uncle Tupelo a contract Band manager Tony Margherita invoked the 50000 escape clause he had put in their Rockville contract freeing the band to sign a sevenyear deal with Sire The deal required two albums and specified a budget of 150000 for the first

Around the time of the recording of March 1620 1992 Mike Heidorn had secured a steady job at a Belleville newspaper company and was dating a woman who had two children from a previous marriage Uncle Tupelo had planned a tour of Europe but Heidorn wanted to stay in Belleville with his girlfriend whom he married in August 1992ref nameCST 

The band held auditions prior to the promotional tour for March 1620 1992 and two candidates stood out Bill Belzer and Ken Coomer Although Farrar and Tweedy agreed that Coomer was the better drummer they were intimidated by his sixfootfour stature and long dreadlocks The band instead selected Belzer as Heidorns replacement but he only stayed with the band for six months Tweedy explained Belzers departure

blockquoteI want to believe it was purely musical and I honestly believe that it wasnt working musically I also believe that we werent emotionally mature enough to be close friends with a gay person at that point in our livesnbsp And Bill was and is a very proud and righteous gay person very open about his homosexualityblockquote

After touring Europe opening for Sugar American bandSugar the band replaced Belzer with Coomer The band also experimented with new members John Stirratt replaced Brian Henneman who left to form The Bottle Rockets while Max Johnston musicianMax Johnston the brother of Michelle Shocked joined as a live mandolin and violin performer Stirratt became the fulltime bassist allowing Tweedy to perform more songs with the guitar

Now a fivepiece Uncle Tupelo recorded their major label debut at Cedar Creek studio in Austin Texas in early 1993 Anodyne albumAnodyne consisted of liveinthestudio recordings and included a duet with Farrar and Doug Sahm of the Sir Douglas Quintet The album sold 150000 copies and was their only entry on the Billboard magazineBillboard Top HeatseekersHeatseekers chartrefref The group toured until the end of the year finishing with a soldout concert at Tramps in New York City Because of their concert draw major executives at Sire began to see the band as a potential hit

In 1993 the band contributed a cover of Creedence Clearwater Revivals track Effigy to the AIDSBenefit album No Alternative produced by the Red Hot Organization

 Breakup 
With the addition of Stirratt Coomer and Johnston just prior to the recording of Anodyne Farrar and Tweedys relationship became more tumultuous leading to verbal altercations after concerts In one account Tweedy recalled

blockquoteAround this time I would say something into a microphone onstage and afterward Farrar would pull me aside and say Dont you ever fucking talk into that microphone again He would misconstrue me talking into the microphone as more evidence of my outofcontrol rampant ego more evidence of me feeling like I didnt have to be so fucking afraid anymoreblockquote

Tweedy felt the new members gave him a new opportunity to contribute to the band but Farrar felt disdain for Tweedys new carefree attitude Years later Farrar would claim that he had been tempted to quit the band after seeing Tweedy stroking the hair of Farrars girlfriend an act which he believed to have been a propositionref Last accessed June 8 2007ref In January 1994 Farrar called manager Tony Margherita to inform him of his decision to leave the band Farrar told Margherita that he was no longer having fun and did not want to work with Tweedy anymore Soon after the breakup Farrar explained his departure It just seemed like it reached a point where Jeff and I really werent compatible It had ceased to be a symbiotic songwriting relationship probably after the first recordref Last accessed June 8 2007ref

Tweedy was enraged that he heard the news secondhand from Margherita rather than directly from Farrar The following day the two engaged in a verbal confrontation As a favor to Margherita who had spent a substantial amount of money to keep the band running Farrar agreed to a final tour with Uncle Tupelo in North America Tweedy and Farrar again engaged in a shouting match two weeks into the tour due to Farrars refusal to sing harmony on any of Tweedys songs The band made its first appearance on national television during the tour when they were featured on Late Night with Conan OBrien Sire had requested that the band perform The Long Cut on the show which further irked Farrar since the song was written and sung by Tweedy

Uncle Tupelos last concerts two shows at The Blue Note Columbia MissouriThe Blue Note in Columbia Missouri and two shows at Mississippi Nights in St Louis took place from April 28 to May 1 1994 A special last leg poster was created for the occasion which facetiously promoted the band as St Louiss 4th best country band based on a readers poll in the Riverfront Times On the last night Tweedy and Farrar each performed nine songs during the concert and Mike Heidorn performed as drummer during the encore

 Postbreakup 

Following Uncle Tupelos final tour Tweedy encouraged his bandmates to join him in a new group while Farrar searched for members for a band of his own Tweedy was able to retain the rest of the Uncle Tupelo lineup and created Wilco They began rehearsing a few days after the final Uncle Tupelo concert and by August 1994 they were in the recording studio for their first album AM Wilco albumAM Farrar asked Jim Boquist to join his new band Son Volt Boquist was a multiinstrumentalist who had performed with Joe Henry as the opening act on Uncle Tupelos last tour Boquist also recruited his brother Dave and Farrar convinced Mike Heidorn to leave Belleville to join the group Farrars new fourpiece began recording their debut album Trace Son Volt albumTrace in November 1994

Wilco signed to Reprise Records while Son Volt signed with Warner Bros Records Son Volt had an early college rock hit with Drown from the album Trace but Wilco maintained a more commercially successful career in the years to followrefrefref Last accessed June 8 2007ref Regarding the possibility of a reunion Mike Heidorn reported in a PopMatters interview that nothings ever for sure but I would have to say No such thingref Last accessed June 8 2007ref Farrar said that he does not want the band to get back together while Tweedy said that he believes that a reunion would not be productive musicallyref Last accessed March 8 2015refref Last accessed June 8 2007ref

Farrar and Tweedy sued Rockville Records and Dutch East India Trading CEO Barry Tenenbaum in 2000 over royalties that the label allegedly owed them winning restitution from Tenenbaum and the joint rights to Uncle Tupelos first three albums After securing the rights the band released a compilation entitled 8993 An Anthology In 2003 Uncle Tupelo reissued their first three albums which before the lawsuit had cumulatively sold over 200000 copies

 Influences 
As The Primitives Tweedy and Farrar were highly influenced by punk bands such as The Ramones and The Sex Pistols However they began to listen to country music because punk rock was not well received in the Belleville and St Louis music scenes While they originally were introduced to country by their parents it was not until this time that they began to listen to it for leisureref nameNYT  Farrar typically wrote songs about Middle America USMiddle America while Tweedy wrote about more mainstream topics such as relationships Farrar took influence from authors such as Kurt Vonnegut and Jack Kerouac whom he read while working at his mothers bookstoreref Last accessed June 8 2007ref As a singer Farrars lyrics would be frontandcenter during performances but the bands musical style was mostly driven by Tweedy and Heidorn Jeff Tweedy said in an interview with the St Louis PostDispatchref namePD 

blockquoteWe probably have more influences than we know what to do with We have two main styles that have been influences For instance we like Black Flag bandBlack Flag as much as early Bob Dylan and Dinosaur Jr as much as Hank Williams To us hardcore punk is also folk music We draw a close parallel between the two Well play both in the same set if we get a chance We dont have any biases as far as music is concernedblockquote

Tweedy in particular was inspired by the Minutemen and wrote a song about D Boon following Boons death in a van accidentrefTweedy Jeff Lyrics D Boon Still Feel Gone Gramophone recordLP Rockville 1991ref The band has released songs originally performed by Creedence Clearwater Revival The Carter Family Lead Belly Gram Parsons The Soft Boys The Louvin Brothers Texas Tornados and The Stoogesref Last accessed May 22 2007ref Releasing March 1620 1992 when alternative music was breaking through was a move inspired by Neil Youngs decision to release the challenging albums On the Beach Neil Young albumOn the Beach and Tonights the Night Neil Young albumTonights the Night immediately after the commercially successful Harvest Neil Young albumHarvest Critic Michael Corcoran likened the bands musical style to Bob Mould fronting Soul Asylum on a speededup version of a Gram Parsons songrefref

blockquoteIts strange to hear Uncle Tupelo mentioned because what we were doing was in such a long line of musical history People are wrong in starting with us and saying we started anything because we were just picking up the ball starting with Woody Guthrie and on to the early 60s and the Flying Burrito Brothers that we were influenced by We didnt start a genre We contributed to a long line of fairly good music Thats the way we looked at it at the timedoing what was right for the songblockquote
