History

Inception
During recording of Buffalo Springfields third and final album Last Time Around lead singers Stephen Stills Neil Young and Richie Furay each recorded songs without the other members present  One of Furays solo efforts was the countryinfluenced ballad Kind Woman which he recorded with the help of producerengineerbassist Jim Messina musicianJim Messina and pedal steel guitarist Rusty Young musicianRusty Youngref nameEderref

When Buffalo Springfield split up Furay Messina and Rusty Young decided to start their own group oriented toward such songs Its original lineup was Furay vocals and rhythm guitar Messina lead guitar vocals producer Rusty Young pedal steel guitar banjo dobro guitar mandolin and vocals George Grantham musicianGeorge Grantham drum kitdrums and vocals and Randy Meisner bass guitarbass and vocals The group was signed to a recording contract with Epic Records which acquired the rights to Furay from the Springfields Atlantic Records subsidiary Atco RecordsAtco label in return for those to Graham Nash of The Hollies who was moving to Atlantic as part of forming Crosby Stills  Nashref nameEder  Originally the new group was named Pogo after the Pogo comicsPogo comic strip character but was changed when its creator Walt Kelly objected and threatened to sue

Furay era 19691973
Their debut Pickin Up the Pieces Poco albumPickin Up the Pieces 1969 is considered a pioneering album of the country rock genrerefEder Bruce   Pickin Up the Pieces review Allmusicref The first edition of the Rolling Stone Record Guide edited by Dave Marsh and John Swenson gave the release 5 stars its highest rating as an essential album However the album performed weakly peaking at Nonbsp63 on Billboard magazineBillboard Billboard 200album chartref nameThe Great Rock Discography

The bands lineup proved to be a problem throughout its career During the recording of the debut album Meisner left the group as a result of a conflict with Furay reportedly Meisner had objected after Furay barred all but himself and Messina from the first albums final mix playback sessionsrefEliot Marc To the Limit The Untold Story of the Eagles Da Capo Press 2004 p37 ref After a stint playing with Ricky Nelsons Stone Canyon Band Meisner later became a founding member of the Eagles bandEagles Messina briefly took over on bass until Timothy B Schmit joined the band in September 1969ref nameThe Great Rock Discography

Their second studio album Poco albumPoco 1970 again resulted in low sales peaking at Nonbsp58 However the bands next album the live set Deliverin or DeLIVErin as it is sometimes represented picked up moderate airplay Furays Cmon hitting Nonbsp69 Deliverin became Pocos first album to reach the Top 40 on the Billboard 200Billboard 200 peaking at Nonbsp26

Messina chose to leave the band in October 1970 feeling Furay exerted too much control over the groups sound He also was anxious to get off the road and return to his career in studio production This would lead him ultimately on to Loggins  Messina At the recommendation of Peter Cetera of Chicago bandChicago Messina selected guitaristsinger Paul Cotton a onetime member of the Illinois Speed Press to replace himref nameThe Great Rock Discography

The realigned Poco now on its third lineup on just its fourth album hired Steve Cropper as record producerproducer and released From the Inside Poco albumFrom the Inside 1971 Again poor sales were the result as the release landed at Nonbsp52

The band and its management were dissatisfied with Croppers production and hired Canadian  Jack Richardson record producerJack Richardson whod had big success with The Guess Who and oversaw the next three albums beginning with A Good Feelin to Know 1972 The band built the LP around the title track a popular concert tune but the single failed to chart The album itself peaked at Nonbsp69 As a result Furay became increasingly discouraged with Pocos prospects especially since exbandmates Stills Young Meisner and Messina were so successful with their respective groups In an April 26 1973 Rolling Stone magazine interview with Cameron Crowe he vented that Poco was still a secondbilled act and had not increased its audience

The next album Crazy Eyes 1973 reached Nonbsp38 but Furay departed at its release and joined with JD Souther and Chris Hillman to create the SoutherHillmanFuray Band on Asylum Records  Poco decided not to replace Furay and continued as a quartetref nameThe Great Rock Discography

PostFuray era 19731977
After Furays departure the band released their last two albums with Epic Seven Poco albumSeven 1974 and Cantamos 1974 The albums charted at Nonbsp68 and Nonbsp76 respectively Poco left Epic after Cantamos and signed with ABCDunhill Records

Head Over Heels Poco albumHead Over Heels was their first ABC release featuring Schmits acoustic Keep On Tryin which became the groups most successful single to date charting at Nonbsp50 on the Billboard Hot 100Billboard Hot 100 Around the time of the release of Head Over Heels The Very Best of Poco 1975 albumThe Very Best of Poco was released as a compilation album that documented the groups years with Epic  Epics release fought with Head Over Heels for attention though neither charted very well hitting Nonbsp43 and Nonbsp90 respectivelyref nameThe Great Rock Discography

The groups next ABC album was Rose of Cimarron albumRose Of Cimarron which also failed to generate much enthusiasm and peaked at Nonbsp89 Another Epic release also came out in 1976 the live album Live Poco albumLive

Al Garth exLoggins and Messina who guested on Head Over Heels and Rose of Cimarron was added to the groups 1976 touring line up on sax and violin but was gone by the end of that year

In the summer of 1976 the group was on the bill with the StillsYoung Band teaming but was left high and dry when Neil Young pulled out of the tour which was then canceled

Indian Summer Poco albumIndian Summer was released the following spring peaking at Nonbsp57 while the title track reached Nonbsp50ref nameThe Great Rock Discography The appearance of Steely Dans Donald Fagen playing synthesizer on two of the albums tracks marked a move away from the country rock sound the band had primarily been known for

Success 19771980
In August 1977 Schmit quit to join the Eagles bandEagles coincidentally replacing former Poco member Meisner yet again  As a result a fully produced live album recorded at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium in Los Angeles in July 1977 was shelved by ABC  After languishing in storage for many years the album was eventually released by John Thaler and Futuredge Music in partnership with Universal Special Projects as The Last Roundup PocoThe Last Roundup in 2004

After Schmits departure Poco decided to take a break Grantham took some time off while Young and Cotton decided to continue as the CottonYoung Band and redoubled their efforts to succeed  They selected the Britons Steve Chapman Drum kitdrums and Charlie Harrison bass guitarbass backing vocals formerly of Judas Jump both of whom had played together with Leo Sayer and Al Stewart to round out their new quartet  However ABC decided to pick up the CottonYoung album   as long as they continued under the Poco name Thus although Grantham had never quit Poco he found himself bought out of the group after he was not happy with the changes in its business setup including the groups publishing no longer being divided evenly After a stint with McGuinn Clark  Hillman he subsequently landed a job as drummer for Ricky Skaggs

Legend PocoLegend 1978 the CottonYoung album with cover art by graphic artist and later comedy actor Phil Hartman subsequently became the groups most commercially successful LP containing two Top 20 hits Crazy Love Poco songCrazy Love written and sung by Rusty Young which also had a sevenweek run at Number 1 on the Hot Adult Contemporary TracksAdult Contemporary chart in early 1979 the biggest hit on the AC chart that year and Cottons Heart of the Night songHeart of the Night  The album was RIAA certificationcertified gold Pocos first album to achieve this distinction in original distribution

Kim Bullard keyboard instrumentkeyboards backing vocals joined the band in December 1978 just after Legend was released  While Crazy Love was riding up the charts in early 1979 ABC Records was sold to MCA Records  Poco was retained by MCA and the Legend album was reissued on the MCA label

With the momentum built up from Legends success Poco were invited by the Musicians United for Safe Energy MUSE collective to play during their concerts at Madison Square Garden in September 1979 And their new hit Heart of the Night appeared on the resulting live album No Nukes albumNo Nukes the concerts and album all being in support of nuclearfree energy Both the concerts and the album also featured several other big artists such as Bruce Springsteen and Jackson Browne

19801999

During the first half of the 1980s the group released five more albums Under the Gun Poco albumUnder the Gun 1980 Blue And Gray 1981 Cowboys  Englishmen 1982 on MCA and moving over to Atlantic Records Ghost Town PocoGhost Town 1982 and Inamorata PocoInamorata 1984 Poco failed to duplicate the success achieved by Legend with each album performing more poorly than its predecessorref nameThe Great Rock Discography

Poco also contributed the song Ill Leave it Up to You to Fast Times at Ridgemont Highs soundtrack in 1982

On Inamorata the band mostly played down their Country rock sound to adopt more of an 80s style with more keyboards and glossy synth sounds as well as electronic drums The album also featured guest spots by former members Timothy B Schmit Richie Furay and George Grantham

The group lost its recording contract with Atlantic due to the slow sales of Inamorata but continued to tour mostly in small clubs Bullard left to rejoin Crosby Stills  Nash in 1983 but still appeared on the sessions for Inamorata   and Harrison who had not played on Inamorata departed in mid1984 New members Jeff Steele bass and Rick Seratte keyboards backing vocals came in for Pocos 1984 tour dates but they departed along with drummer Chapman to be replaced in 1985 by future Great Plains Tennessee bandGreat Plains front man Jack Sundrud vocals bass guitar and the returning Grantham Granthams reunion with Poco was brief though In late 1985 Steve Wariner asked him to join his band Chapman came back to take over drums again During this period the band  relocated to Nashville and recorded some demos though no record deal resulted And after a few scattered live dates for the group in 1986 and 1987 Paul Cotton pursued a solo career and did not perform with Poco again until 1992 while Young played in Vince Gills band

After a lengthy recording hiatus at the urging of Richard Marx and his manager Allen Kovac who took on Poco the band reemerged on the RCA label with the successful Legacy PocoLegacy 1989 reuniting original members Young Furay Messina Grantham and Meisner twenty years after Pocos debut Though Timothy B Schmit and Paul Cotton were also approached to appear on the project Schmit declined and Cotton who was busy with his solo career was bought out of the group and it ended up being only the five originals The album produced a Top 20 hit Call It Love in the fall of 1989 and another Top 40 hit Nothing to Hide in early 1990 earning Poco its second gold album in its 19th releaseref nameThe Great Rock Discography

The group having added a keyboardist Dave Vanacore toured in early 1990 opening for Marx and appeared at Farm Aid IV on April 7 1990 at the Hoosier Dome in Indianapolis Indiana But Furay now a church minister in Colorado then had to bow out due to his commitments and Poco toured as a headliner in the summer of 1990 with Sundrud returning to take over rhythm guitar from Furay

Despite Legacys gold status and the two hit singles the band did not make much money on their 1990 tour one of the problems being their booking into military bases that turned out to be mostly empty as the troops were all deployed for the Desert Shield operation in the Persian Gulf RCA ended up dropping them from their roster and recordings for a proposed follow up to Legacy were abandoned

In 1991 Poco toured as an acoustic trio with Young Messina and Meisner drummer Gary Mallaber joined them for dates in Japan that July mostly to make up dates that were missed the previous year But by the end of 1991 Messina and Meisner had returned to their individual careers

After Messina and Meisner left Young formed a side project Four Wheel Drive with John Cowan from New Grass Revival Foster  LloydBill Lloyd from Foster  Lloyd and Patrick Simmons of Doobie Brothers They were signed to a recording deal with RCA RecordsRCA Nashville and completed an album which was never released Warner Bros Records then picked up the group in 1993 but when they were threatened with lawsuits from bands who had already copyrighted the name Four Wheel Drive they changed the bands name to The Sky Kings But their one and only album minus Simmons who left when the Doobies schedule got too busy completed in 1997 was not released until 2000 three years after the group disbanded

In the meantime Rusty Young was the sole owner of the Poco name by early 1992 and though they had not officially disbanded the band seemed to be quietly fading away Despite this Young once again teamed with Cotton brought in new members Richard Neville vocals bass and Tim Smith drums and toured through the end of the decade although on a very limited schedule Young and Cotton also occasionally appeared as Poco as an acoustic duo

On September 16 1995 Poco appeared at Deadwood Jam in Deadwood South Dakota where former Loggins  Messina drummer Merel Bregante filled in for Tim Smith

20002013
Poco again became more active as a touring unit after they signed with Nashville manager Rick Alter and brought back Grantham and Sundrud in June 2000 reuniting the groups 1985 lineup

Running Horse 2002 found the band in the studio for the first time in thirteen years The CD was released through the bands website Furay who had continued to make guest appearances at their shows over the years when they played in his adopted homestate of Colorado reunited with the band again for a soldout show in Nashville in May 2004 resulting in the CDDVD release Keeping the Legend Alive 2004

On July 29 of that same year during a show at Stearns Square in Springfield Massachusetts Grantham suffered a stroke during the performance For their gig the following night at Barnstable County MassachusettsBarnstable County Fair in East Falmouth MA Poco brought in local drummer Chuck Woodhams then called Youngs Nashville neighbor Muscle Shoals Sound Studio drummer George Lawrence who had earlier stood in for Tim Smith at some Poco concerts in June 1999 to sub on drums for Grantham for the rest of 2004 He became a permanent member in 2005 Granthams recovery was slow and expensive and the group created a donor fund on its official website Poconutorg to offset some of his considerable medical expenses

Poco continued to write and record while performing at festivals performing arts centers theaters and clubs  In 2005 they played a short tour in Europe but Cotton was hospitalized in Norway with health issues and missed the last two shows of the tour Guitarist and singer Bill Lloyd of duo Foster  Lloyd substituted for Cotton for several subsequent shows in the US

Cotton returned in 2006 stabilizing the lineup of Young Cotton Sundrud and drummer George Lawrence Cotton and Sundrud released solo albums and Young started writing an autobiographical history of the band Poco alumni continued to periodically reunite in concert with this lineup

Beginning in 2009 Grantham occasionally appeared with the band again but limited his contributions to vocals only  Richie Furay and Jim Messina returned for several 2008 Poco performances at the Wildwood Lodge in Steelville Missouri a tour of California in 2009 ending at the Stagecoach Festival in Indio where they were joined by Grantham and Timothy B Schmit and several dates opening for Loggins and Messina featuring Furay Messina and Grantham

Bareback at Big Sky 2005 and  The Wildwood Sessions 2006 captured live acoustic versions of songs both new and familiar from their 40plus year career   Live at Columbia Studios Hollywood 93071 2010 unearthed an unreleased 1971 live performance by Furay Young Schmit Grantham and the then recently recruited Cotton in front of a private audience of family and friends

In early 2010 Paul Cotton left Poco abruptly publicly citing a financial dispute with Young On his official website he announced he would not be appearing with Poco at the Wildwood concerts stating It was not all that shocking when Rusty told me on February 27 that he would not honor the contract that I had been requesting for over 15 years and that this was goodbye On March 12 2010 Young responded on Pocos official website It was a sad day when I read on Pauls website that he wasnt coming to Wildwood and I guess that means hes leaving the band Poco immediately reformed with Young Sundrud Lawrence and new keyboardist and multiinstrumentalistsinger Michael Webb of Nashville Tennessee

The bands new incarnation continued to tour and record In early 2012 a live video of a new song Neil Young was released on YouTube as a teaser for a new studio album All Fired Up Poco albumAll Fired Up that was recorded in Nashville and released in March 2013 Selling on iTunes the bands website and through a distributor in Europe Young Sundrud and Webb penned all the songs on the selfproduced album

In its 45th year Rusty Young was the only original member in the band and remained the leader and front man on stage  He has been the only member of Poco to have performed at every gig and played on every recording since the bands inception in 1968

Retirement
At the end of 2013 Rusty Young announced his retirement At the age of 68 he said he had spent 45 years on the road in the same band and needed a break A few shows were booked into 2014 including three farewell shows in Florida One of those shows was a performance in a recording studio in front of a live audience for a DVD documentary of the bands live show Young said there could be some oneoffs in the future after that but the band would not be actively touring as before Young was finishing his memoirs for a book to be published He and Sundrud wrote and recorded music for childrens story videos as the Session Cats Lawrence Sundrud and Webb continued to write record and play in their own projects and to do freelance work with other artists in Nashville where they live Young continued to do guest performances with former members of Poco and other country rock artists

Poco was inducted into the httpCMHOForg Colorado Music Hall of Fame CMHOF with the CMHOF induction ceremony which took place at the Paramount Theatre Denver Colorado on January 9 2015 and included a performance by the following lineup of band members Paul Cotton Richie Furay Timothy B Schmit and Rusty Youngrefref  Also inducted into the CMHOF along with Poco were Firefall The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band and Stephen Stills and Manassas bandManassas

In early 2020 Poco friend and fan Tom Hampton was brought in by Sundrud to replace Browning for tour dates but touring was suddenly halted in March due to the COVID19 pandemicrefref

Rusty Young died on April 14 2021 at his home in Davisville Missouri from a heart attack He was 75refref  His death marked the end for Poco

History
Formation

In 2002 Brown was traveling with a heavy tour schedule of approximately 200 dates a year The initial Zac Brown Band lineup consisted of Brown on acoustic guitar and lead vocals backed by drummer Marcus Petruska and bass guitarist Jacob Lawson In 2003 Brown started his own label called Home Grownit was later renamed Southern Ground

In 2004 Brown opened a music club and restaurant with his father in the Lake Oconee area of Georgia called Zacs Place where the fare was southernstyle cooking A developer bought the restaurant and in turn the Zac Brown Band bought a tour bus and began touring fulltime playing rock and country clubs as well as folk and jam band festivals The release of the Zac Brown Bands first independent album Home Grown occurred during the same year

Also in 2004 Brown added violinistfiddler and tenor vocalist Jimmy De Martini to the lineup According to an interview with De Martini he explained that Wyatt Durrette Browns frequent songwriting collaborator was working as a bartender at Sidelines Sports Bar in Kennesaw Georgia at the time where the Zac Brown Band frequently performed Durette suggested De Martini to Brown who was wanting a lead instrument in his band as well as a harmony singer After doing several performances with the band at the club Brown asked De Martini to become a permanent member to which De Martini gladly obligedrefref

Brown met John Driskell Hopkins in 1998 when Hopkins was hosting an open mic night at CJs Landing in Buckhead Georgia Hopkins later recorded Home Grown in his music studio Brighter Shade Studios The two remained friends and in 2005 Hopkins stepped in as bass guitarist while helping the group finish what became their numberone single Toes Toes was the second single from the bands majorlabel debut The Foundation Zac Brown Band albumThe Foundation which was partially recorded in Hopkins studio You Get What You Give albumYou Get What You Give was also partially recorded in Brighter Shade Studios

Coy Bowles transferred to Atlantas Georgia State University to study music He subsequently became involved in Atlantas various music scenes and eventually formed Coy Bowles and the Fellowship in 2004 Two years later Bowles decided to reconnect with Brown Through mutual friends he learned that the Zac Brown Band was scheduled to perform in Atlanta one evening Bowles and Brown spent the afternoon prior to the performance reacquainting with each other which ended with Brown inviting Bowles to sit in with his band at that nights performance To return the favor Bowles invited the band to attend his own gig with the Fellowship a couple of months later which in turn resulted in Brown and his band sitting in at that gig

This turn of events continued for eight months until Bowles concluded that it was too overwhelming to balance his time with Browns band and his own band in addition to other activities he therefore made a decision to put the Fellowship on an indefinite hiatus and became a permanent member of the Zac Brown Bandrefrefrefref

In 2008 the Zac Brown Band signed to Live Nation Artists Records in association with Browns own Home Grown label after Chris Fryar became an addition to the band An Alabama native Fryar attended the University of North Texas and the Mississippi University for Women and made a name for himself in the Birmingham AlabamaBirmingham music scenerefref According to Fryar a mutual friend recommended him to Brown who was in need of a new drummer for the band Fryar who in turn had just finished a stint with a previous band subsequently auditioned and shortly afterward became the Zac Brown Bands newest memberrefref

Commercial success

The Zac Brown Bands debut single Chicken Fried was originally recorded in 2003 and included on the Home Grown album but later rerecorded and released to country radio in 2008 This song was also recorded by The Lost Trailers whose 2006 recording was released as a single but withdrawn after Brown decided that he wanted to release it himselfrefref Brown also cowrote Simple Life a song recorded by The Lost Trailers on their 2006 The Lost Trailers albumselftitled album

In the third episode of HBOs music documentary series Foo Fighters Sonic HighwaysSonic Highways Brown was a featured interviewee and explained why Lost Trailers version of Chicken Fried was pulled from the radio Brown stated that after six years of touring that he was broke and sleeping in his tour van In 2005 the Lost Trailers contacted Brown and expressed interest in recording Chicken Fried Brown stated he agreed under the condition that the song would only be an album cut and not a single as he still had hopes of releasing the song as a radio single himself

Both parties agreed and the Lost Trailers recorded the song Some months later the Lost Trailers landed a deal with Sony Nashville and when they submitted the tracks for their album they included Chicken Fried Joe Galante then the Chairman of Sony Music Nashville heard the tracks and chose Chicken Fried as the single that the label wanted to promote

Brown described hearing his song on the radio The first time I hear Chicken Fried on the radio and it wasnt us singing it It was a nightmare Brown then called his lawyer to have the song pulled from the radio immediately Browns lawyer warned him that because of Galantes power in the Nashville music scene that pulling the song could essentially have him blackballed in Nashville Brown was insistent that his agreement with the Lost Trailers was violated so his lawyer issued a cease and desist letter and the single was pulled from the radio

A few months later The Zac Brown Band was booked to perform at 3rd and Lindsley in Nashville and producer Keith Stegall came to watch their performance Stegall and Brown had drinks later that night and Brown recalled Stegall stating I just had to meet the kid that told Joe Galante to fuck off Brown credits this incident and his meeting and collaboration with Stegall as the beginning of his success in the music business

Five of these songs were recorded when we were doing Family Man and when we were deciding what to do with it we broke it up into two records The Other Life is representative of the other side of the coin from Family Man and the way my life has been going in a lot of ways At first we were going to call it The Outsider but once we got into the film we thought Well its like a mirror a dark mirror of what Family Man was  Jennings told TheBootcom

History
The band was formed in Columbus Ohio in 1970 and had its first success in Cincinnati Craig Fuller Tom McGrail Jim Caughlan and John David Call had played together in various bands since high school notably the Vikings the Omars the Sacred Turnips and the Swiss Navy

In 1970 the first Pure Prairie League lineup was Fuller McGrail singersongwriterguitarist George Ed Powell a popular Cincinnati folk singer Phill Stokes bassist in Columbus bands Sanhedrin Move and JD Blackfoot and Robin Suskind a popular guitar teacher in the University of Cincinnati neighborhood on guitar and mandola with John David Call joining the band later that year Calls steel guitar added country credibility to the bands playlist and sparked guitar duels with Fuller that created the signature sound of the band They rose to popularity as the house band at New Dillys Pub in the Mt Adams section of Cincinnati

In mid1971 McGrail and Stokes left the band to rehearse with  but were unable to put a viable band together Jim Caughlan who had played guitar and drums with Fuller Call and McGrail in earlier bands took over on drums and Jim Lanham from California formerly of The Yellow Payges and Country Funk replaced Stokes on bassref nameLarkinref Suskind departed as well soon after the arrival of Caughlan and Lanham 

Early on Pure Prairie League was looking for national artist representation and made contact with a wellknown Cleveland based rock and roll promoter Roger Abramson At the behest of the groups roadie Jim Westy Westermeyer who had also worked for the James Gang Abramson saw the band at New Dillys Pub and later signed them to a management contract Abramson was able to land a contract with RCA Records He then placed Pure Prairie League as an opening act with many of the concerts he produced at that time

Their selftitled Pure Prairie League albumfirst album used a Norman Rockwell The Saturday Evening PostSaturday Evening Post cover showing a trailworn cowboy named Luke who would appear on the cover of every Pure Prairie League recording thereafterref nameLarkin After releasing their debut album recorded in New York City in March 1972 and embarking on a nationwide tour Call Caughlan and Lanham all left the band

At that point Pure Prairie League owed RCA another album and Craig Fuller agreed to record the second record in RCAs Toronto studio with the help of George Ed Powell and Bob Ringe who had also produced the first album Al Brisco played pedal steel guitar on the session Bustin Out begun in the summer of 1972 was produced by Ringe and featured the songs of Fuller and Powellref nameLarkin Billy Hinds from Cincinnati drums percussion joined the band and Hindss friend Michael Connor played piano on most of the sessions and would become a regular in the Pure Prairie League lineup for years to come Mick Ronson added string arrangements to several tracks most notably Boulder Skies and Call Me Tell Meref nameLarkin Michael Reilly who would become the longtime bass player and front man for the band joined in early September 1972 soon after the record was completed Bustin Out was released in October 1972ref nameLarkin

Shortly afterward the group returned to Ohio and Fuller had to face trial for charges of draft evasion in Kentucky Before conscientious objector CO status could be arranged he was sentenced to six months in jail and forced to leave Pure Prairie League in February 1973 At this point RCA dropped the band and their future looked bleak

By August 1973 the band members were in Cincinnati and managed to persuade Call to return Fuller though out of prison by now was working the late shift in a community hospital to satisfy his CO requirements and was not inclined to rejoin at that time He was eventually given a full pardon by President Gerald Ford Reilly took over as the bands leader and front man and brought in his friend Larry Goshorn vocals guitars to replace Fuller in November 1973 Goshorn had played in a popular Ohio band called the Sacred Mushroom

Pure Prairie League hit the road and began playing gigs constantly mostly in the Northeast Midwest and Southeast As a result of their heavy schedule particularly at colleges their songs became well known Amie songAmie Craig Fullers ode to an onagainoffagain relationship from the second album became a particular favorite

Success
As Amie songAmie grew in popularity radio stations began receiving requests for it As a result RCA rereleased the Bustin Out and Pure Prairie League  albums and issued Amie as a single It peaked at Nonbsp27 on April 26 1975 just as a minor bluegrass revival was underway on midwestern college campuses

In the early 1970s Larson eventually settled in San Francisco California where she worked in a record store Discount Records on Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley CaliforniaBerkeley which also sold tickets for shows at the Fillmore West and Winterland and for the Golden Gate Country Bluegrass Festival Turning to singing her performance career began with  a booking as the opening act for Eric Andersen at The Egress a club in VancouverVancouver British Columbia In 1975 Larson auditioned for Hoyt Axton who was producing Commander Cody and His Lost Planet AirmenCommander Cody This led to Larson singing with Hoyt Axton and The Banana Band who were opening for Joan Baez on the Diamonds and Rust tour in 1975 She earned her first recording credit on Commander Codys 1975 album Tales From the Ozone toured with his band and also provided background vocals on subsequent Commander Cody albums in 1977 and 1978 Other early career singing credits were for Axton and Guy Clark both in 1976 the following year her resume included further credits with Mary Kay Place Rodney Crowell Billy Joe Shaver Jesse Colin Young Jesse Winchester and Gary Stewart singerGary Stewart

Larson and Guthrie Thomas both had their first professional recording session on Axtons Southbound album for AM Records As newcomers to the recording industry they were listed on the back cover of the album as Street Singers entirely separate from the highly paid more established artists also appearing on the albumrefref

Larsons work with Emmylou Harris  whose 1977 album Luxury Liner albumLuxury Liner prominently showcased Larson on the song Hello Stranger  led to her meeting and then befriending Harriss associate and friend Linda Ronstadt In 1977 Larson was at Ronstadts Malibu CaliforniaMalibu home when neighbor Neil Young phoned to ask Ronstadt if she could recommend a female vocal accompanist Ronstadt suggested Larson she was the third person that day to mention Larson to Young He came over to meet Larson who recalled Neil ran down all the songs he had just written about twenty of them We sang harmonies with him and he was jazzedrefref

The following week Ronstadt and Larson cut their vocals for Youngs American Stars n Bars album at Youngs La Honda CaliforniaLa Honda ranch  the two women were billed on the album as the Bullets  and in November 1977 Young invited Larson to Nashville to sing on his Comes a Time album This led to Larsons being signed to Warner Bros Records

Larsons work with Commander Cody had led to her being signed to the country musicCW division of Warner Bros Records However her debut album Nicolette albumNicolette released September 29 1978 was an eclectic mix of rock CW and RB

Despite the release of her album so late in the year Larson was acclaimed Female Vocalist of 1978 by Rolling Stone which wrote no one else could sound as if she were having so much fun on an album Nicolette reached Nonbsp15 on Billboards album chart aided by the hit single Lotta Love a Neil Young composition Larsons Lotta Love hit 1 on the Easy ListeningAdult Contemporary chart and went Top 10 Pop in February 1979 Linda Ronstadt Valerie Carter Bill Payne James Burton and Patrick Simmons performanced on Nicolette albumNicolette albumrefhttpswwwwincityvoicesorgartmusicjeffsplaylistnicolette Nicolette wincityvoicesorg Retrieved 22 August 2024ref

Larson would be unable to consolidate the commercial success augured by her debut the second single off Nicolette Rhumba GirlrefRhumba Girl was written by Jesse Winchester who introduced it as Rhumba Man on his Nothing But a Breeze album Although Larson had been a session singer on Nothing But a Breeze she had not sung on Rhumba Man first hearing the song at a live performance by Winchesterref just missed becoming a major hit for Larson at Nonbsp48 Her second album In the Nick of Time released November 1979 failed to showcase Larsons voice attractively Don Shewey in Rolling Stone wroteblockquoteLarsons roughedged downhome tone is definitely appealing  especially when she backs up the likes of Neil Young and Steve Goodman whose High and Outside album featured a duet with Larson The One That Got Away  but as a soloist her limited vocal resources are severely taxed  Its symptomatic of Nicolette Larsons problems as a performer that the finest singing on In the Nick of Time is by Michael McDonald singerMichael McDonald Let Me Go Lovenbsp McDonalds entrancing vocal presencenbsp so overshadows Larsons that she seems to be playing second fiddle rather than sharing the lead Elsewhere Larson is dwarfed by Ted Templemans typically luxurious productionref namelarsonblockquote

Loggins and Messina was an American pop rock duo consisting of Kenny Loggins and Jim Messina musicianJim Messina who achieved major chart success during the earlymid 1970s Among their wellknown songs are Dannys Song House at Pooh Corner songHouse at Pooh Corner and Your Mama Dont Dance After selling more than 16 million records and becoming one of the leading musical duos of the 1970sref nameThibodeauxTogether again Kenny Loggins and Jim Messina musicianJim Messina bring their hits to Biloxi by Ron Thibodeaux The TimesPicayune New Orleans July 29 2005ref Loggins and Messina separated in 1976 Although Messina would find only limited popularity following the breakup Loggins went on to achieve major chart success in the 1980s In 2005 and again in 2009 Loggins and Messina reformed for tours in the United States

History
Initial career 19711976
Jim Messina musicianJim Messina formerly of Buffalo Springfield and Poco bandPoco was working as an independent record producer for Columbia Records in 1970 when he met Kenny Loggins a littleknown singersongwriter and guitarist who was signed to ABCDunhill as a staff songwriterref nameLarkinref

The two recorded a number of Loggins compositions in Messinas home living room When Columbia signed Loggins to a sixalbum contract with the assistance of Messina recording began in earnest for Loggins debut album with Messina as producer Messina originally intended to lend his name to the Loggins project only to help introduce the unknown Loggins to Messinas wellestablished Buffalo Springfield and Poco audiences However by the time the album was completed Messina had contributed so much to the album  in terms of songwriting arrangement instrumentation and vocals  that an accidental duo was born

Their debut album was released November 1971 as Kenny Loggins with Jim Messina Sittin In Loggins and Messina albumSittin In The albums first single release the Caribbeanflavored Vahevala or Vahevella or Vaheevella found top 3 success on Chicagos WCFL AMWCFL on May 18 1972refref Vahevala and Nobody But You both reached the Hot 100 Although at first the album went unnoticed by radio upon release it eventually gained traction by autumn 1972 particularly on college campuses where the pair toured heavily Loggins and Messinas harmonies meshed so well that what was begun as a oneoff album became an entity unto itself Audiences regarded the pair as a genuine duo rather than as a solo act with a wellknown producer Instead of just continuing to produce Loggins as a sole performer they decided to record as a duo Loggins and Messinaref nameLarkin

On March 3 1973 Loggins and Messina played Carnegie Hall Ian Dove in the New York Times called it a nearperfect rock n roll concertrefref

When our first album Sittin In Loggins and Messina albumSittin In came out we started receiving a lot of excitement about the music and good sales Messina recalled in 2005 We had a choice It was either I now go on and continue to produce him and we do the solo career or we stay together and let this work For me I did not desire to go back out on the road I had had enough of that and I wanted to produce records But Clive Davis then president of the record company intervened and said You know I think youd be making a mistake if you guys didnt take this opportunity Things like this only happen once in a lifetime It may merit you sleeping on it overnight and making a decision that will be in your best interest He was absolutely correct Kenny made the decision as well It delayed his solo career but it gave him an opportunity I think to have oneref nameThibodeaux 

Messina assembled The Kenny Loggins Band by summoning old friends bassist Larry Sims and drummer Merel Bregante formerly of The Sunshine Company multireedist Jon Clarke musicianJon Clarke and violinistmultireedist Al Garth Famed Grammywinning keyboardist songwriter and record producer Michael Omartian played keyboards on the Sittin In Loggins and Messina albumdebut Loggins and Messina albumsecond and Full Sail Loggins and Messina albumthird albums but did not join them on tour Los Angelesbased session percussionist Milt Holland played on all of the duos studio albums but like Omartian he did not tour with themrefref

Over the next four years from 1972 to 1976 they produced four more studio albums of original material plus one album of Cover versioncovers of other artists material So Fine Loggins and Messina albumSo Fine and two live albums They sold 16 million records and were the most successful duo of the early 1970s surpassed later in the decade only by Hall  Oatesref nameThibodeaux  They charted three top 20 singles from the second and third albums Your Mama Dont Dance No 4 Thinking of You Loggins and Messina songThinking of You No 18 and My Music songMy Music No 16 Their work was covered by other prominent artists including Lynn Anderson who recorded Listen to a Country Song songListen to a Country Song in 1972 and reached No 3 on the charts and Anne Murray who reached the US top ten with Dannys Song in early 1973 and the US top twenty with A Love Song Loggins and Messina songA Love Song in early 1974 The later studio albums Mother Lode albumMother Lode 1974 Native Sons Loggins and Messina albumNative Sons 1976 often found both Loggins and Messina more as two solo artists sharing the same record rather than as a genuine partnership As both Loggins and Messina noted in 2005 their collaboration eventually became more a competition

Never really a team of true equals because of the initial teacherapprentice nature of their music experience levels the pair had quietly amicably parted in 1976 Their final studio album of original material Native Sons Loggins and Messina albumNative Sons was released January 1976 Later that year the duo went on a final tour ref nameLarkin though prior to the start of the tour Loggins accidentally cut his hand with a craft knife while practicing his woodcarving hobby at home which required surgery thereby preventing him from playing guitar for most of that final tour The final two concert dates of Loggins  Messina  as a duo  were in Honolulu Hawaii at the Neil S Blaisdell Center on September 24 and 25 1976 upon which the duo then parted to embark on solo careers Messina found solo success elusive but Loggins went on to become one of the biggest hitmakers of the 1980s

A greatesthits album The Best of Friends albumThe Best of Friends was released in November 1976 two months after the duo had ended  In January 1977 a second live album from concerts in 1975 and 1976 Finale albumFinale was released more by record company decision than one intended by the artists

Reformation
The two reunited in 2005 to choose tracks for an expanded compilation album of singles and album cuts The Best Sittin In Again which proved successful enough for them to embark on tour together Their successful Sittin In Again tour was launched in mid2005 and playedout the remainder of the year They also released an album that year of the tour Every couple of years wed talk about it but I was having too much fun as a solo artist Loggins said that summer It was very rewarding for me and I wasnt ready to share the reins I still had a lot of stuff to do on my own to prove myself and to express myself in a way that wouldnt have fit in with Loggins and Messinaref nameThibodeaux 

The two were pleased enough to consider future Loggins and Messina projects and the two also toured in 2009 Like most relationships we were a moment in time Loggins said Its just really fun to be able to go back and celebrate that and just sort of really honor each other as grown men in a way we never really did back then We were young and competitive and didnt realize that it wasnt necessarily all about getting your way but you learn that if you grow upref nameThibodeaux 

Their backing band changed from album to album with the core members listed below Some albums featured backing members who later were wellknown in their own right John Townsend artistJohn Townsend and Ed Sanford later of the SanfordTownsend Band Smoke from a Distant Fire contributed vocals and songwriting to the Native Sons their final studio album

Patrick Kevin Skinnerrefref born February 25 1974 is an American country music singer from the Jackson Purchase region of Kentucky He is the winner of the Americas Got Talent season 4fourth season of Americas Got Talent

 Early life and career 
Skinner is from the Dublin community of Graves County KentuckyGraves County Kentucky and started playing the guitar when he was 12 years old He has been playing writing and singing ever since he learned the art of music from his musician father Joe who is a fan of Hank Williams Skinner is divorced and has two children a daughter and a son He has worked as a chicken catcher for several years and claims to have caught with his friends up to 60000 chickens in one night

 Americas Got Talent 

 Audition 
Skinner performed in a live audition on the August 4 2009 episode of Americas Got Talent He became a fan favorite in the show after his performance of Garth Brooks If Tomorrow Never Comes while strumming his guitar Judges Piers Morgan Sharon Osbourne and David Hasselhoff all voted Yes sending him to the Vegas Round

 Vegas Round 
Skinner then appeared without performing in the Vegas Round His audition was strong enough for the judges to send him to the Quarterfinals in Episode 411

 Quarterfinals 
His Week 1 Quarterfinals performance in Episode 413 consisted of singing Bob Dylans Make You Feel My Love while playing the guitar Kevin received enough votes to be sent to the Semifinals in Episode 414 instead of Mosaic

 Semifinals 
The Week 1 Semifinals performance in Episode 421 consisted of Skinner guitar playing and singing Always On My Mind by Brenda Lee Piers Morgan gave him a standing ovation saying that singing from the heart and soul with real raw emotion is the whole story about him while the two of them were both tearyeyed as well as the audience in which Kevin was reminded that he had the ability to move an audience in a way that Piers never saw on AGT before concluding that Kevin is one of his favorites to win the season

In the end Kevin received enough votes to be sent to the Finals in Episode 422 instead of Acrodunk basketball trampoline dance group

 Finals 
Later in the Finals Skinners performance in Episode 425 consisted of singing his rendition of Aerosmiths I Dont Want to Miss a Thing while playing his guitar and having a backup band and vocals

Judge Piers said the rendition wasnt perfect and had a missed odd note with little flattened places but described the moment as the point of Skinners journey as a rough diamond needing professional training But remembering the words on how Hasselhoff described Skinner Piers said that he was what the show was created for while being unemployed and catching chickens the past year at that time But despite those obstacles it was a better way for America itself to get out of its recession and have Skinner compete in the show

Even though Sharon said that he doesnt have the best voice in the contest she reminded Kevin that he does not need to sound perfect while describing him as one of the greatest and unique icons similar to Johnny Cash Bob Dylan Mick Jagger and Lou Reed all of whom did not need to have the perfect voices but are all such unique individuals

The judges once again all gave him standing ovations

 Finale 
Kevin Skinner received enough votes to be included in the Top 5 in Episode 426 instead of Drew Stevyns Kevin was revealed to have competed in first place in the competition that same night in front of Barbara Padilla who was runner up Recycled Percussion in third place The Texas Tenors in fourth and The Voices of Glory in fifth winning one million dollars and a headline show in Las Vegas
