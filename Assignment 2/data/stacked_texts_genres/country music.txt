Rileys career was stagnant until former Mercury Records producer Shelby Singleton received a demo tape of Rileys voiceref nameLarkinCountry Singletons fledgling label Plantation Records was starting to enjoy success Seeing potential in the Tom T Hall demo song Harper Valley PTA Singleton worked with Riley to record it
ref nameHarper The record quickly became one of the bestknown country music songs of all time Riley was the first woman to hold the Number 1 spot on the pop and country charts with the same songref nameIMDB

Success of Harper Valley PTA
Harper Valley PTA was released in 1968 and immediately became a hit It topped the Billboard magazineBillboard Billboard Hot 100Hot 100 and Hot Country Songs chartsref nameTarradell a feat not repeated by a female artist until Dolly Partons 1981 hit 9 to 5 Dolly Parton song9 to 5 The song is about Mrs Johnson a widowed woman who confronts members of the ParentTeacher AssociationPTA after her daughter brings home a note from school critical of her mothers penchant for miniskirts and dating various men Mrs Johnson turns the tables on the PTA and exposes its hypocrisy one member at a time noting that their private behavior is far worse than hers

Riley became an overnight sensation as the single earned her the Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance and was named the Country Music Association Single of the Year Riley also became one of the few country artists ever nominated in the major pop Grammy Award categories of Best New Artist and Record of the Year The single sold over five and a half million copies worldwide and was awarded a music recording sales certificationgold disc by the RIAA just four weeks after its release The album of the same name sold over one million units to earn Riley another gold recordref nameThe Book of Golden Discsref

During the late 1960s and into the very early 1970s Riley ranked among the most popular female vocalists in the country music industry She had five Grammy Award nominations and four Country Music Association nominations and performed a duet with Loretta Lynn She had success on the country charts again but on a lesser scale

Other hits following Harper Valley PTA include The Girl Most Likely There Never Was A Time The Rib The Back Side of Dallas Country Girl Oh Singer and Good Enough to Be Your Wiferef nameLarkinCountry

Riley became known as much for her sex appeal and beauty as for her music foreshadowing Shania Twain and other contemporary female vocalists by nearly three decades At a time when many country queens were keeping a wholesome image by wearing gingham dresses Riley kept in tune with typical late1960s fashion by donning miniskirts and gogo boots for her stage outfits somewhat in the character of the protagonist in PTAref nameLarkinCountry  Her Mod subculturemod persona opened doors and perhaps started a sexual revolution in country music as hemlines of other female country artists stage outfits began rising in the years that followed But Riley was not comfortable with that image and she eventually abandoned it for a more traditional wardrobe floorlength gowns and anklelength dresses typically worn by other female country artists  In the 1993 CBS documentary The Woman of Country she noted that during the Harper Valley period her publicist and manager were largely responsible for creating and playing up her sexy image matching the character pictured on the Harper Valley album cover

Late 1970s and the 1980s
Rileys success brought a number of offers from Cinema of the United StatesHollywood and she appeared with Bing Crosby Dean Martin Bette Davis Tom Jones singerTom Jones Ed Sullivan and others on various television programsref nameIMDBref

Riley left Plantation Records for MGM Records in 1972 recording several albums but only two of her singles from the period Good Morning Country Rain and Give Myself A Party cracked the top 30  Later stints at Mercury Records and Warner Bros Records produced only a couple of charted singles but she remained in demand as a concert artist well into the 1980s
