When Hunger Project disbanded Alan Anton and Michael Timmins remained in London and started an improvisational band named Germinal The members  Michael Timmins on guitar Alan Anton on bass a drummer and saxophonist played whatever they wished on their instruments at the same time Germinal released two studio albums Germinal 1 1983 and Din 1984 The music newspaper New Musical Express said Germinal ranks among the most innovative and aggressive sounds to emerge from the independent scene this year Alan Anton and Michael Timmins had a somewhat different take saying It was the ultimate release for us But for the audience it was quite a chorerefref In London they developed journeyman skills as musicians and expanded their knowledge of music history  Michael Timmins worked in a record store for a year to make ends meet while with Germinal Among those who were to influence Michael Timmins and Alan Anton were jazz musicians Cecil Taylor Ornette Coleman John Coltrane along with the sound of early blues musicians Lightnin Hopkins John Lee Hooker Bukka White and Robert Johnsonref nameCold Dawn Germinal broke up after three years in autumn of 1984 Alan Anton moved to Berlin and Michael Timmins returned to New York Cityref name86 Promo sheet

Upon their return to Toronto in 1985 Alan Anton and Michael Timmins rented a house insulated the tiny garage and with younger brother Pete Timmins sitting in on drums began exploring a new musical direction Margo was drafted to join and recalls I was contemplating going on to graduate school staying in school That was safe I never wanted to be a musician or be onstageref nameCold Dawn Nevertheless Michael Timmins began to hear something in what they were doing with their initial jams realizing that a female voice was what the band needed Michael Timmins said I thought if you had this female voice on top of it you could do anything you wantedref nameCold Dawn

However the slow musical tempos and whispery hushed tones that defined their early work was not just musical inspiration but came about by necessity Their recording studio was their repurposed garage which was just behind the house and bordered closely with their neighbours On their first jam session the police showed up due to a noise complaint from the neighbourref nameCold Dawn According to Michael Timmins We realized we had to tone down One thing fed into the other Margo began to realize that her singing voice was more effective quiet We began to realize if we can get down underneath Margo the sound will be more effective Pete picked up brushes  he was just learning to play drums at that point Everything sort of came down We learned to play with less volumeref nameCold Dawn

When the unnamed band was preparing for its first gig the members considered various names before choosing Cowboy Junkiesrefref During their early gigs the band would perform at The Rivoli which had a small space in the back The group would perform a rhythmic groove while Margo sang improvised vocal melodies and portions of old blues songs Many times the Junkies entire performance would be a single jam sessionref nameCold Dawn

Peter J MoorePeter Moore a recording enthusiast who had ambitions of becoming a producer was at their first show According to Moore I was mesmerized by Margo The very first show people werent paying attention to them because they were playing so softly and quietly Margo had her back to the audience a lot of the timeref nameCold Dawnref

 1980s 
When the Cowboy Junkies were ready to record a studio album the band sought a likeminded recording engineer They met Peter Moore at a dinner party and when they began talking about recording equipment and techniques they found that Moores interest in singlemicrophone recording meshed with their desire to capture the intimate sound of their rehearsal garagerefref Moore had just purchased a Calrec AmbisonicsAmbisonic microphone at the wholesale price of 9000ref nameCold Dawn The Cowboy Junkies and Moore came together at the rehearsal space on June 26 1986 and turned the garage into a recording studio Moore arranged the group around his Calrec juryrigged a control room in the kitchen and started recordingref nameSound on Soundref

The Cowboy Junkies shopped their material but were unable to find a label to distribute their work so they revived the indie label Latent Recordings that Michael Timmins and Anton had used for their Hunger Project and Germinal works and released Whites Off Earth Now in October 1986 They sold 3000 copiesrefref The band then toured the US Michael Timmins described the experience While touring Whites we had spent a lot of time in the Southern states especially Virginia Georgia and the Carolinas For some reason the club owners down there took a liking to what we were doing so we spent a lot of time crossing the kudzu choked highways that ran through the heart of the old Confederacy Those were the days when having to spend a night in a hotel room would mean the difference between eating the next day or paying for the gas to get us to the next town so we spent a lot of our time sleeping on the floors of friendly promoters fans waitresses and bartendersrefref

The bands next project The Trinity Session 1988 became their breakthrough Peter Moore again produced the album They approached the project as a reaction against the MIDIdominated musical styles of the 80s Moore said I was angry that music had gotten into drum machines and MIDI No humanity no nothing Im listening to these recordings from the 50s with two or three mics and Im going Man thats real music He chose the Church of the Holy Trinity TorontoChurch of the Holy Trinity in Toronto for its natural reverb To better persuade the officials of the historic church Moore claimed The Timmins Family Singers were recording a Christmas specialref Page 8 websiteLatent Recordings accessdateJune 12 2018 authorTimmins Michael ref The session began early on November 27 1987 Songs with the fewest instruments were recorded first and then the songs with gradually more complex arrangements In this way Moore was able to solve acoustic problems one by one To better balance Margos vocals against the electric guitars and drums she was recorded through a PA system left behind by a previous group By making subtle changes in volume and placement relative to the microphone over six hours Moore and the band finally reached the distinctive sound of the albumref nameSound on Sound

Music critic for Rolling Stone magazine Anthony DeCurtis summed up the result of the groups efforts in a fourstar review of the album The Trinity Session is in the great tradition of albums that establish a mood and sustain it so consistently that the entire record seems like one continuously unfolding song The mood in this instance is hypnotic and introspective  an intense melancholic longing that blends the elemental emotions of country music and the blues with the poetic worldweariness of the Velvet Underground  Having good songs the skill to convey what they have to say and most important a vision the Cowboy Junkies dispensed with hightech trumpery and made their record simply and seriously That attitude helped make the album as important as it is inspiringrefref

 1990s 
The bands third studio album was more challenging requiring three attempts to get the sound the band desired Yet despite the problems with the making of it the band considers it a very exciting and turbulent time in their career and state that The Caution Horses 1990 remains one of their favourite albumsref Caution Horses  Page 2 websiteLatent Recordings accessdateApril 27 2018 archivedateApril 28 2018 archiveurlhttpswebarchiveorgweb20180428093807httplatentrecordingscomcj_exclusivescautionhorsesindex2html urlstatusdead ref The band rented a small recording studio in the docklands of Toronto with the intention of using the room like the garage their debut studio album was recorded in instead of a room with live acoustics like the church room they used for The Trinity Session 1988 The session went badly because the group had just come off the road after a gruelling tour and were tired particularly Margo Timmins who had a terrible head cold After a few hours they realized the session wasnt working out and they leftref Caution Horses  Page 3 websiteLatent Recordings accessdateApril 27 2018 ref

The second attempt was made on April 21 of 1987 when Peter J MoorePeter Moore rented the Sharon Temple an historic landmark located in the village of Sharon Ontario Michael Timmins recalls The arrangements that we had developed for this new set of songs were at times so full and lush unlike the spareness of most of Trinitys songs that we were immediately confronted with the problem of how to control this swirl of sound so that it didnt just turn to mush on tape Another problem was that the Temple was a lot more acoustically lively than any of us had imagined As a result when the music swelled it would often spill over into Margos vocal mic and feedback At the end of three days during which the temperature would drop below freezingref Caution Horses  Page 4 websiteLatent Recordings accessdateApril 27 2018 archivedateMarch 4 2016 archiveurlhttpswebarchiveorgweb20160304105425httplatentrecordingscomcj_exclusivescautionhorsesindex4html urlstatusdead ref Michael Timmins states When we packed up and left Sharon that day I dont think that any of us felt that we had captured anything special It had been a difficult three days and I think that we were all just happy that on that third day we had at least made some decent recordings of the songs if not necessarily memorable onesref Caution Horses  Page 5websiteLatent RecordingsaccessdateApril 27 2018archivedateApril 25 2017archiveurlhttpswebarchiveorgweb20170425023811httplatentrecordingscomcj_exclusivescautionhorsesindex5htmlurlstatusdeadref Over the next several months the band were touring and playing songs on the Sharon tape As the band listened new ideas for them evolved They also wrote additional songs Although the band truly loved the recordings the songs continued to develop on stage and they believed the session no longer accurately represented where they were as a band In 2022 however they released the Sharon session as a special edition vinyl album as well as in streaming formatsrefref

The Cowboy Junkies sixth studio album Lay It Down Cowboy Junkies albumLay It Down 1996 was one in which the group wanted to make the music outside of Toronto and away from usual routines so they searched for a place that was a comfortable drive away from Toronto but would feel remote Alan Anton recalls We found Rock Island named not for music but for geology It is actually one big rock with stuff growing on it and has one small house with a great stone fireplace We went there for a week at a time and between chopping wood cooking boating whittling hiking and staring into the fire worked up some songs that were as laid back and sparse as the settingref Lay It Down  Page 1 websiteLatent Recordings accessdateApril 28 2018 archivedateMarch 27 2019 archiveurlhttpswebarchiveorgweb20190327204456httplatentrecordingscomcj_exclusiveslayitdownindexhtml urlstatusdead ref When the Junkies went to record the songs they felt that their chosen songs would come together if they could find a studio which would approximate the vibe of Rock Island in the sense of a relaxed but focused mood and its remoteness from the music industry mainland They found a bigporched southern house in Athens Georgia that fit their needs The Junkies moved into the rented home in the suburbs of Athens in June 1995 The producer and engineer John Keane had built a homey but stateoftheart studio and the band settled in quicklyref Lay It Down  Page 3websiteLatent RecordingsaccessdateApril 28 2018archivedateFebruary 3 2010archiveurlhttpswebarchiveorgweb20100203191541httplatentrecordingscomcj_exclusiveslayitdownindex3htmlurlstatusdeadref

One Soul Now 2004 was recorded over the course of a year from October 2002 to October 2003 Its central idea is that everyone is interconnected When the band returned home after their Open Tour they decided to turn their rehearsal area into a recording studio which they dubbed The Clubhouse This new arrangement changed the process of how they created their tracks Previously they would start in the rehearsal space determine how the songs would work then go to a studio Now the band recorded everything as they worked through the rehearsal processrefref

Michael asked his brother Peter Timmins to send him a highend portable recorder which he carried everywhere he went and recorded music conversations exercise classes badminton games traffic students chatter in classrooms street hawkers and more He sent the recordings to Joby Baker in British Columbia with instructions to create loops of the sounds and to use his imagination The core of the album is built around a fictional love story between two people who live in different worlds that always keep them apart Renmin Park is also a thankyou letter to the people of the city that so kindly welcomed him and his familyref nameRenmin Park

 Critical reception 
Lavender Countrys selftitled first album Lavender Country was described by Pitchfork upon its reissue in 2014 as wobbly and amateurish but in a playful come on yall sort of wayrefref

Blackberry Rose has been described as full of twang sometimes funny often quirky and not very tight musically in a Grateful Dead kind of wayrefref Pitchforks Jason Greene describes Lavender Countrys sound as unchanged from their first album to their second saying Haggerty returns to recording virtually unchanged His voice which was unaffected and childlike in its simplicity in 1973 is unaffected and childlike in 2022refref

Other critics have been less positive Kyle Trigger Coroneos of Saving Country Music gave the album a rating of 010 stating  As an album Blackberry Rose is awful Its incredibly amateurish poorly performed even more poorly engineered and produced with hackneyed and rudimentary instrumentation that often cant even stay on time with the crudelyconstructed songs Coroneos also stated that he feels other critics have given the album undeserved praise saying the more you lie about your feelings on an album like Blackberry Rose the more clout you accrue It shows your loyalty to the causerefref

Rita Corinne Hosking is an American composer and musician based in Davis California  She plays Americana musicAmericana and bluegrass musicbluegrass styles of music with both standards and original songsrefref  Since the release of Are You Ready she has been performing around the country at concerts festivals and other venuesrefrefrefref

Hoskings music isnt like the polished overproduced music found in pop culture Hers is a minimalist sound that reflects a simpler time and place a little country town rather than a big cityrefref

Leading up to her 2010 performance tour of Great Britain she received increasing attention on the East Side of the pond   Reviewer Paul Kerr of AmericanaUK remarked that she is    a very talented artist with the ability to step up to that pantheon of great female country folk singers and writers  refref  In the summer of 2010 Hosking played to packed venues in England Wales and Cornwallrefref

Im no expert on the Appalachians at all but I figure there are similarities  the economy and some traditions logging and mining So as a songwriter you focus on that You take the human struggle to survive particularly in a beautiful place they love and youve pinned down a lot of artistic inspirationrefref

As described by Neil Spencer of the Guardian UK   Hosking    hits impressive form on this album  Her songs are compassionate tales about ordinary folk from her north Californian background  loggers miners the mothers of lost sons  but there is anger as well as warmth in her voice Montgomery Creek Blues and Promise Land in particular meld the personal and political to become stateofthenation songsrefref

Recordings

The first two Hackensaw Boys albums were released by the Valley Entertainment label Get Some in 2000 and Keep It Simple in 2002 The releases proved to have limited commercial appeal



Keep It Simple is packed with vigorous pitchy bursts notes Amanda Petrusich in her Pitchfork MediaPitchfork review noting the album doesnt perfectly reflect the bands fastandfierce live show  



Get Some was recorded by Rhoderick Cole in his Charlottesville mansion  Keep It Simple was recorded in Sickmens apartment in Charlottesvilles Linen Building also by Cole who did the sound engineering on both recordings Give It Back released in 2004 was selfproduced

The group signed with the music label Nettwerk for the 2005 release of Love What You Do Their second release for Nettwerk Records Look Out in 2007 was a celebratory but defiant sound culled from oldtime mountains backstage doorways and punishing drives through the evolving American landscape according to Isthmus newspaperIsthmusThe Daily Page



Another reviewer concurred stating the album is the Boys at their best a perfect medium between their raw early years and the more polished sound of their previous releaserefhttpjaredmorningstarblogspotcom200707cdreviewhackensawboyslookouthtml CD REVIEW The Hackensaw Boys Look Out The Hank in Chains Review Thursday July 12 2007ref Bullington states Look Out was definitely an attempt to capture sonically and as beautifully as possible the sound of the Hackensaws onstage The group went into the studio with the defined intention of   trying to capture the live performance as best as we possibly could And I think we totally succeeded in doing thatref namerecoilmagcom  The album got to Nonbsp6 on the Americana music charts and contained nine originals including a couple from the sometimes Modest Mouse sometimes Hackensaw Tom Pelosoref nameheralddispatchcomhttpwwwheralddispatchcomlifex698791441BrokenpelviswontstoptheHackensawBoys Broken pelvis wont stop the Hackensaw Boys by Dave Lavender The HeraldDispatch December 10 2008ref

Following the release of Love What You Do and Look Out The Hackensaws departed from Nettwerk Records to release two independently produced sixsong Extended playEPs The Old Sound of Music Vol 1 and The Old Sound of Music Vol 2  These two collections are recommended for anyone who feels that time popularity and maybe Don Was has watered down Old Crow Medicine Show The Hackensaw Boys bring the Appalachian string band roots with punk rock flowers hard and rawrefhttpninebulletsnetarchivesthehackensawboystheoldsoundofmusicvol1 THE HACKENSAW BOYS  THE OLD SOUND OF MUSIC VOL 1 in 9b February 14 2011ref  The albums resulted from recording sessions held at the Sound of Music studios in Richmond Virginia They were mastered by Grammy award winner Charlie Pilzer As with Look Out in 2007 all songs were engineered by Bryan Hoffa archival audio restoration specialist at the Library of Congress The titles bestowed by Ferd Lionel Moyse IV were inspired by the fact that these were the last two recording projects to come out of the old Sound Of Music facility which has recently moved to a new building in Richmond

 Charismo 2016 
The group released Charismo through Free Dirt Records in 2016 after almost a decade without putting together a studio album Larry Campbell produced Glide Magazine said of the album that the group take a tack similar to that of Old Crow Medicine Show the Punk Brothers The Howlin Brothers and other modern outfits that draw from the past to make an impression in the present They went on to say that theirs is a sound once heard on back porches throughout the heartland now brought to life with the stirring enthusiasm of wouldbe rock stars performing for appreciative audiencesrefref
