The remaining four members decided to rotate lead vocal duties amongst themselves instead of hiring a new lead vocalist as they thought Stewart was the most conservative member of the group and that alternating the lead vocal would allow the band to become more adventurousref namesobel In addition they thought this arrangement was tenable due to their admiration of other bands with more than one lead vocalist such as the Eagles Chicago bandChicago and the Beatlesref namerobert They first performed without Stewart at a concert in Grand Forks North Dakota in early 1992 followed by a series of dates throughout Canadaref namesobelref To accommodate for Stewarts departure the other band members assumed the vocal duties when singing their existing singles in concert Innis sang The Bluest Eyes in Texas and Fast Movin Train Dittrich sang Dancys Dream and Big Dreams in a Small Town Jennings sang A Tender Lie and Gregg sang everything else The only song omitted from their set lists was Why Does It Have to Be Wrong or Right due to it having a more complex vocal arrangement which they felt could not be achieved with only four voicesref namerobert

History
The groups members were originally part of country pop singer Don King musicianDon Kings road bandref nameLarkin When King stopped touring in 1981 the group decided to stay together The band played up to five sets a night six days a week for a time at Knights Corral on Nolensville Rd in Nashville as Bobby Mark and Sandgap until they auditioned for the TV show Star Search in 1983 They won the grand prize of 100000 and a recording contractref nameallmusicref

The band originally chose the name Savanna When another band with a similar name emerged the group decided to change its own monikerref nameLarkin They met at their managers office in Nashville TennesseeNashville and began looking through area telephone books for inspiration They blindly landed on the name of a nearby thoroughfare Sawyer Brown Road and derived the new band name Sawyer Brownref nameallmusicref nameoldiesref


The band signed with Capitol Records and scored a Top 20 hit with their first single Leona in 1984ref nameLarkin That success was quickly followed by their first Nonbsp1 hit Step That Stepref nameLarkin The band had their ups and downs on the charts throughout the 1980s landing only sporadic Top 10 hits However by 1990 they had accumulated enough hits for a Greatest Hits package and were successful on the touring circuit

Originally Sawyer Brown was known for a primarily country pop sound dominated largely by novelty tunes by 1991 however the band began to express a more serious side to its music by adding ballads to its repertoireref nameallmusic That year the band also dropped its affiliation with Capitol and Curb Records assumed promotion and distribution of all subsequent albums and singles except for 2003 when Sawyer Brown temporarily switched to Lyric Street Records Bobby Randall also left the band in 1991 and was replaced by Duncan Cameronref nameoldies Cameron subsequently departed in 2004 with Shayne Hill assuming the role of lead guitarist

In 1991 after the release of their album Buick guitarist Bobby Randall left the group to remain close to his family and host a shortlived TV talent show Be a Star Bobby Randall joined to band called Dallas County Line formed in Birmingham AlabamaBirmingham Alabama in late 1991  early 2003 are disbanded Duncan Cameron formerly of The Amazing Rhythm Aces was chosen as his replacement just as Sawyer Brown was about to become country musics it band The band then switched labels moving to Curb Records and releasing the albums The Dirt Road Café on the Corner and Outskirts of Town which saw hit after hit for the band in the early to mid1990sref nameLarkin

Part of the bands newfound success was due to singersongwriter Mac McAnally who wrote several songs for the group The McAnallypenned songs mostly ballads helped to redefine Sawyer Brown who up until this point had been reviled by many critics for being a flamboyant bubble gum pop act that emphasized style over substance The Walk the final single off the Buick album is said to be the turning point for the group

Following The Walk the band scored a number of Top 5 and Top 10 hits including 2 more Billboard Nonbsp1s with 1992s Some Girls Do songSome Girls Do and 1993s Thank God for You which Mark Miller cowrote with Mac McAnally By 1995 Sawyer Brown had enough hits for a second Greatest Hits package The album titled Greatest Hits 1990 to 1995 included two new singles This Time and I Dont Believe in Goodbye which themselves became Top 5 hits

In the latter half of the 1990s the group seemed to gradually fall out of favor with country radio despite a crossover hit in 1999 with Drive Me Wild They parted ways with Curb in 2003 and signed with Lyric Street Records One single was released on Lyric Street before Sawyer Brown left that label as well 2004 saw the group returning to Curb Records just as Duncan Cameron decided to leave the group to pursue a lifelong dream of flying for Southwest Airlines Guitarist Shayne Hill replaced Duncans post as guitarist although both Cameron and Hill are in the credits on Mission Temple Fireworks Stand The albums title track featuring Robert Randolph guitaristRobert Randolph peaked at Nonbsp55 The second single off that album They Dont Understand was a minor Top 40 hit on the country charts and Top 20 on the Christian single charts

The next day it was widely reported that the name Lady A had already been in use for more than 20 years by Seattlebased African American activist and blues soul funk and gospel singer Anita White The band again admitted ignorance of any prior use which White called social privilegepure privilege Interviewed by Rolling Stone White described the bands token acknowledgement of racism while blithely appropriating an African American artists name Theyre using the name because of a Black Lives Matter incident that for them is just a moment in time If it mattered it would have mattered to them before It shouldnt have taken Murder of George FloydGeorge Floyd to die for them to realize that their name had a slave reference to it Its an opportunity for them to pretend theyre not racist A veteran music industry lawyer observed that such name clashes are uncommon due to the existence of the Internetref namerollingstone1013919refrefref The band members contacted White the next week to apologize for having inadvertently coopted and dominated her nameref nameApologizingref saying that the Black Lives Matter movement had inspired them to a collaborative attitude They nonetheless required retaining the same name though she believed dualnaming is inherently impossibleref nameBuryref She said We talked about attempting to coexist but didnt discuss what that would look likeref nameApologizing because the band members would not directly respond to that explicit question three times during the conversation or in two contract drafts She soon submitted a counteroffer that either the band would be renamed or that her act would be renamed for a 5 million fee plus a 5 million donation to be split between Seattle charities a nationwide legal defense fund for independent artists and Black Lives Matterref nameBury

On July 8 2020 the band filed a lawsuit against White asking a Nashville court to affirm its longstanding trademark of the name The press release read Today we are sad to share that our sincere hope to join together with Anita White in unity and common purpose has ended She and her team have demanded a 10 million payment so reluctantly we have come to the conclusion that we need to ask a court to affirm our right to continue to use the name Lady A a trademark we have held for many yearsrefref

On September 15 2020 White filed a countersuit asserting her claim to the Lady A trademark and rejecting the notion that both artists could operate in the same industry under the same brand identity She is seeking damages for lost sales and a weakened brand along with royalties from any income the band receives under the Lady A monikerrefrefrefref

In October 2021 musician Lilli Lewiss album Americana was temporarily blocked and held for review by the streamingservice Spotify because one of the songs on the album A Healing Inside credited White as Lady A The album was returned to the streaming within a week of Lewis becoming aware of the situationrefrefrefref

In February 2022 Pitchfork websitePitchfork reported that White and the band had settled their lawsuit the parties filed a joint request for dismissal to a judge in a federal Tennessee court and the terms of the settlement have not been disclosedrefrefrefref

At the onset of her musical career she made the decision to perform under a stage name  She stated My real name is not a secret but I decided to take on another name mostly because I feel that my real name is not that memorableI started thinking about titles that would reflect my music and I was thinking about how I would describe it and it was all very rootsy and tenacious and organic and it all lent itself to this sort of tree flavour and I thought well maybe theres a tree name that would help us with titling this thing And honestly sycamore was one of the first that I looked at and thought it was coolrefref
