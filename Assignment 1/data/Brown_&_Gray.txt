'''Brown''' is a [[color]]. It can be considered a composite color, but it is mainly a darker shade of orange. In the [[CMYK color model]] used in printing and painting, brown is usually made by combining the colors [[Orange (colour)|orange]] and [[black]].<ref>Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, (2002), Oxford University Press.</ref><ref>''Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language'': "A combination of red, blue, and yellow."</ref><ref>Oxford English Dictionaries On-Line: "Of a colour produced by mixing red, yellow, and blue, as of dark wood or rich soil"</ref>

In the [[RGB color model]] used to project colors onto television screens and computer monitors, brown combines [[red]] and [[green]]. The color brown is seen widely in nature, wood, soil, human [[brown hair|hair]] color, [[eye color]] and [[Human skin color|skin pigmentation]]. Brown is the color of dark wood or rich soil.<ref>''Shorter Oxford English Dictionary''; "of a colour produced by mixing red, yellow, and blue, as of dark wood or rich soil"</ref>

According to public opinion surveys in Europe and the United States, brown is the least favorite color of the public; it is often associated with plainness, the rustic, although it does also have positive associations, including baking, warmth, wildlife, the [[autumn]] and [[music]].

== Etymology ==
The term is from [[Old English]] {{lang|ang|brún}}, in origin for any dusky or dark shade of color. The first recorded use of ''brown'' as a color name in English was in 1000.<ref>first attested in ''The [[Metres of Boethius]]'' 26. 58, ca. AD 1000: ''stunede sio brune yd wid odre'' "One dark wave dashed against the other".</ref><ref>Maerz and Paul ''A Dictionary of Color''. New York:1930 McGraw-Hill, p. 191</ref>
The [[Common Germanic]] adjectives ''*brûnoz and *brûnâ'' meant both dark colors and a glistening or shining quality, whence ''[[Burnishing (metal)|burnish]]''. The current meaning developed in [[Middle English]] from the 14th century.<ref>''His hare [was] like to the nute brun, quen it for ripnes fals dun'' "his hair was like the nut brown, when for ripeness it falls down", Cursor M. 18833, ca. AD 1300, cited after [[OED]].</ref>

Words for the color brown around the world often come from foods or beverages; in the eastern Mediterranean, the word for brown often comes from the color of coffee: in Turkish, the word for brown is {{lang|tr|kahverengi}}; in Greek, {{lang|el-Latn|kafé}}.
In Portuguese, Spanish and French, the word for brown or for a specific shade of brown is derived from the word for chestnut (''castanea'' in Latin). In Southeast Asia, the color name often comes from chocolate: {{lang|id|coklat}} in Malay; {{lang|fil|tsokolate}} in Filipino. In Japan, the word {{lang|ja-Latn|chairo}} means the color of tea.<ref>[http://www.omniglot.com/language/colours/] Omniglot- words for colors in different languages.</ref>

== History and art ==

=== Ancient history ===
Brown has been used in art since prehistoric times. Paintings using [[umber]], a natural clay pigment composed of iron oxide and manganese oxide, have been dated to 40,000 BC.<ref>Varichon, ''Couleurs&nbsp;– pigments et teintures dans les mains des peuples''. p. 254.</ref> Paintings of brown horses and other animals have been found on the walls of the [[Lascaux cave]] dating back about 17,300 years. The female figures in ancient Egyptian tomb paintings have brown skin, painted with umber. Light tan was often used on painted Greek amphorae and vases, either as a background for black figures, or the reverse.

The Ancient Greeks and Romans produced a fine reddish-brown ink, of a color called [[sepia (color)|sepia]], made from the ink of a variety of [[cuttlefish]]. This ink was used by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Raphael]] and other artists during the Renaissance, and by artists up until the present time.

In Ancient Rome, brown clothing was associated with the lower classes or barbarians. The term for the plebeians, or urban poor, was "pullati", which meant literally "those dressed in brown".<ref>Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur: Effets et symboliques''. p. 219</ref>

=== Post-classical history ===
In the Middle Ages brown robes were worn by monks of the [[Franciscan order]], as a sign of their humility and poverty. Each social class was expected to wear a color suitable to their station; and grey and brown were the colors of the poor. [[Russet (cloth)|Russet]] was a coarse homespun cloth made of wool and dyed with [[woad]] and [[Rose madder|madder]] to give it a subdued grey or brown shade. By the statute of 1363, poor English people were required to wear russet. The medieval poem ''[[Piers Plowman]]'' describes the virtuous Christian:<ref>{{Cite book |title=Growth and decline in Colchester, 1300–1525 |author=R. H.

In the Middle Ages, dark brown pigments were rarely used in art; painters and book illuminators artists of that period preferred bright, distinct colors such as red, blue and green rather than dark colors. The umbers were not widely used in Europe before the end of the fifteenth century; The Renaissance painter and writer [[Giorgio Vasari]] (1511–1574) described them as being rather new in his time.<ref>Daniel V. Thompson, (1956), ''The Materials and Techniques of Medieval Painting'', p. 88-89</ref>

Artists began using far greater use of browns when oil painting arrived in the late fifteenth century. During the Renaissance, artists generally used four different browns; raw umber, the dark brown clay mined from the earth around Umbria, in Italy; raw sienna, a reddish-brown earth mined near [[Siena]], in [[Tuscany]]; burnt umber, the Umbrian clay heated until it turned a darker shade, and burnt sienna, heated until it turned a dark reddish brown. In Northern Europe, [[Jan van Eyck]] featured rich earth browns in his portraits to set off the brighter colors.

=== Modern history ===

==== 17th and 18th century ====
The 17th and 18th century saw the greatest use of brown. [[Caravaggio]] and [[Rembrandt Van Rijn]] used browns to create [[chiaroscuro]] effects, where the subject appeared out of the darkness. Rembrandt also added umber to the ground layers of his paintings because it promoted faster drying. Rembrandt also began to use new brown pigment, called Cassel earth or Cologne earth. This was a natural earth color composed of over ninety percent organic matter, such as soil and peat. It was used by [[Rubens]] and [[Anthony van Dyck]], and later became commonly known as Van Dyck brown.

==== 19th and 20th century ====
Brown was generally hated by the French impressionists, who preferred bright, pure colors. The exception among French 19th-century artists was [[Paul Gauguin]], who created luminous brown portraits of the people and landscapes of French Polynesia.

In the late 20th century, brown became a common symbol in western culture for simple, inexpensive, natural and healthy. Bag lunches were carried in plain brown paper bags; packages were wrapped in plain brown paper. Brown bread and brown sugar were viewed as more natural and healthy than white bread and white sugar.

== Brown in science and nature ==

=== Optics ===
Brown is a dark orange color, made by combining red, yellow and black.<ref>''Shorter Oxford Dictionary'', (2002).</ref> It can be thought of as dark [[orange (color)|orange]], but it can also be made in other ways. In the [[RGB color model]], which uses red, green and blue light in various combinations to make all the colors on computer and television screens, it is made by mixing red and green light.

In terms of the [[visible spectrum]], "brown" refers to long wavelength hues, [[yellow]], [[orange (colour)|orange]], or [[red]], in combination with low [[luminance]] or [[Saturation (color theory)|saturation]].<ref>"Some Experiments on Color", ''Nature'' '''111''', 1871, in {{cite book | title = Scientific Papers | author = [[John William Strutt]] (Lord Rayleigh) | year = 1899 | publisher = University Press | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KWMSAAAAIAAJ&q=date:0-1923+light+red+green+yellow-or-orange&pg=PA84 }}</ref>
Since ''brown'' may cover a wide range of the visible spectrum, composite adjectives are used such as red brown, yellowish brown, dark brown or light brown.

As a color of low intensity, brown is a [[tertiary color]]: a mix of the three subtractive [[primary color]]s is brown if the [[cyan]] content is low. Brown exists as a color perception only in the presence of a brighter color contrast.<ref>"Color Vision", in {{cite book | title = The Feynman Lectures on Physics | author = [[Richard Feynman]] | year = 1964 | publisher = Addison Wesley Longman | url = https://feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_35.html}}</ref> Yellow, orange, red, or rose objects are still perceived as such if the general illumination level is low, despite reflecting the same amount of red or orange light as a brown object would in normal lighting conditions.

=== Brown pigments, dyes and inks ===
* Raw [[umber]] and burnt umber are two of the oldest pigments used by humans. Umber is a brown clay, containing a large amount of [[iron oxide]] and between five and twenty percent [[manganese oxide]], which give the color. Its shade varies from a greenish brown to a dark brown. It takes its name from the Italian region of [[Umbria]], where it was formerly mined. The principal source today is the island of [[Cyprus]]. Burnt umber is the same pigment which has been roasted (calcined), which turns the pigment darker and more reddish.<ref name="Fabien Petillion p. 30">Isabellle Roelofs and Fabien Petillion, ''La Couleur explquée aux artistes'', p. 30.</ref>
* Raw [[sienna]] and burnt sienna are also clay pigments rich in iron oxide, which were mined during the [[Renaissance]] around the city of Siena in Tuscany. Sienna contains less than five percent manganese. The natural sienna earth is a dark yellow [[ochre]] color; when roasted it becomes a rich reddish brown called burnt sienna.<ref name="Fabien Petillion p. 30" />
* '''[[Mummy brown]]''' was a pigment used in oil paints made from ground Egyptian mummies.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Eveleth |first1=Rose |author-link=Rose Eveleth |title=Ground Up Mummies Were Once an Ingredient in Paint |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/ground-mummies-were-once-ingredient-paint-180950350/?no-ist |website=Smithsonian |access-date=29 February 2016}}</ref>
* '''[[Caput mortuum (pigment)|Caput mortuum]]''' is a haematite iron oxide pigment, used in painting. The name is also used in reference to mummy brown.
* '''Van Dyck brown''', known in Europe as Cologne earth or Cassel earth, is another natural earth pigment, that was made up largely of decayed vegetal matter. It made a rich dark brown, and was widely used during the Renaissance to the 19th century It takes its name from the painter [[Anthony van Dyck]], but it was used by many other artists before him. It was highly unstable and unreliable, so its use was abandoned by the 20th century, though the name continues to be used for modern synthetic pigments. The color of Van Dyck brown can be recreated by mixing ivory black with mauve or with Venetian red, or mixing cadmium red with cobalt blue.<ref>Isabellle Roelofs and Fabien Petillion, ''La Couleur explquée aux artistes'', p. 148.</ref>
* '''Mars brown'''. The names of the earth colors are still used, but very few modern pigments with these names actually contain natural earths; most of their ingredients today are synthetic.<ref name="Fabien Petillion p. 30" /> Mars brown is typical of these new colors, made with synthetic iron oxide pigments. The new colors have a superior coloring power and opacity, but not the delicate hue as their namesakes.<ref name="Fabien Petillion p. 30" />
* [[Walnuts]] have been used to make a brown dye since antiquity. The Roman writer [[Ovid]], in the first century BC described how the [[Gauls]] used the juice of the hull or husk inside the shell of the walnut to make a brown dye for wool, or a reddish dye for their hair.<ref>Anne Varichon, ''Couleurs- pigments et teintures dans les mains des peuples'', pp. 264–265</ref>
* The [[chestnut]] tree has also been used since ancient times as a source brown dye. The bark of the tree, the leaves and the husk of the nuts have all been used to make dye. The leaves were used to make a beige or yellowish-brown dye, and in the Ottoman Empire the yellow-brown from chestnut leaves was combined with indigo blue to make shades of green.<ref>Anne Varichon, ''Couleurs- pigments et teintures dans les mains des peuples'', pp. 262–263</ref>

=== Brown hair ===
{{main|Brown hair}}

Brown is the second most common color of human hair, after black. It is caused by higher levels of the natural dark pigment [[eumelanin]], and lower levels of the pale pigment [[pheomelanin]]. Brown eumelanin is more common among Europeans, while black eumelanin is more often found in the hair on non-Europeans. A small amount of black eumelanin, in the absence of other pigments, results in grey hair. A small amount of brown eumelanin in the absence of other pigments results in blond hair.

=== Brown skin ===
A majority of people in the world have skin that is a shade of brown, from a very light honey brown or a golden brown, to a copper or bronze color, to a coffee color or a dark chocolate brown. Skin color and race are not the same; many people classified as "white" or "black" actually have skin that is a shade of brown. Brown skin is caused by [[melanin]], a natural pigment which is produced within the skin in cells called [[melanocyte]]s. Skin pigmentation in humans evolved to primarily regulate the amount of [[ultraviolet radiation]] penetrating the skin, controlling its biochemical effects.<ref name=jabl1>{{cite book|last=Muehlenbein|first=Michael|title=Human Evolutionary Biology|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=192–213}}</ref>

Natural skin color can darken as a result of [[Sun tanning|tanning]] due to exposure to sunlight. The leading theory is that skin color adapts to intense sunlight irradiation to provide partial protection against the [[ultraviolet radiation|ultraviolet]] fraction that produces damage and thus mutations in the [[DNA]] of the skin cells.<ref name=pmid20445093>{{cite journal |last1=Jablonski |first1=N.

While ''white ''and'' black'' are commonly used to describe racial groups, ''[[Brown (racial classification)|brown]]'' is rarely used, because it crosses all racial lines.
In [[Brazil]], the Portuguese word ''[[pardo]]'', which can mean different shades of brown, is used to refer to multiracial people. The Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) asks people to identify themselves as ''branco'' (white), ''pardo'' (brown), ''negro'' (black), or ''amarelo'' (yellow). In 2008 43.8 percent of the population identified themselves as pardo.<ref>IBGE. 2008 PNAD.

=== Soil ===
The thin top layer of the Earth's crust on land is largely made up of [[soil]] colored different shades of brown.<ref name="Birkeland">Birkeland, Peter W. ''Soils and Geomorphology''. 3rd edition. New York: Oxford University Press, 1999.</ref> Good soil is composed of about forty-five percent minerals, twenty-five percent water, twenty-five percent air, and five percent organic material, living and dead. Half the color of soil comes from minerals it contains; soils containing iron turn yellowish or reddish as the iron oxidizes. Manganese, nitrogen and sulfur turn brownish or blackish as they decay naturally.

Rich and fertile soils tend to be darker in color; the deeper brown color of fertile soil comes from the decomposing of the organic matter. Dead leaves and roots become black or brown as they decay. Poorer soils are usually paler brown in color, and contain less water or organic matter.
* [[Mollisols]] are the soil type found under grassland in the [[Great Plains]] of America, the [[Pampas]] in Argentina and the Russian Steppes. The soil is 60–80 centimeters deep and is rich in nutrients and organic matter.
* [[Loess]] is a type of pale yellow or buff soil, which originated as wind-blown silt. It is very fertile, but is easily eroded by wind or water.
* [[Peat]] is an accumulation of partially decayed vegetation, whose decomposition is slowed by water. Despite its dark brown color, it is infertile, but is useful as a fuel.

=== Mammals and birds ===
A large number of mammals and predatory birds have a brown coloration. This sometimes changes seasonally, and sometimes remains the same year-round. This color is likely related to [[camouflage]], since the backdrop of some environments, such as the forest floor, is often brown, and especially in the spring and summertime when animals like the [[snowshoe hare]] get brown fur.

== Brown in culture ==
<!--This is for the color brown only. Please do not put anything about the word Brown involving the surname.-->
Surveys in Europe and the United States showed that brown was the least popular color among respondents. It was the favorite color of only one percent of respondents and the least favorite color of twenty percent of people.<ref>Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur; effets et symboliques''. p. 4</ref>

=== Brown uniforms ===
Brown has been a popular color for military uniforms since the late 18th century, largely because of its wide availability and low visibility. When the [[Continental Army]] was established in 1775 at the outbreak of the [[American Revolution]], the first [[Continental Congress]] declared that the official uniform color would be brown, but this was not popular with many militias, whose officers were already wearing blue. In 1778 the Congress asked [[George Washington]] to design a new uniform, and in 1779 Washington made the official color of all uniforms blue and [[buff (colour)|buff]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.army.mil/symbols/uniforms/history.html |title=Army Dress Uniform |access-date=2013-04-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141119095538/http://www.army.mil/symbols/uniforms/history.html |archive-date=2014-11-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 1846 the Indian soldiers of the [[Corps of Guides (India)|Corps of Guides]] in British India began to wear a yellowish shade of tan, which became known as [[khaki]] from the [[Urdu]] word for dust-colored, taken from an earlier Persian word for soil. The color made an excellent natural [[camouflage]], and was adopted by the [[British Army]] for their Abyssian Campaign in 1867–1868, and later in the [[Boer War]]. It was adopted by the United States Army during the [[Spanish–American War]] (1896), and afterwards by the [[United States Navy]] and [[United States Marine Corps]].

In the 1920s, brown became the uniform color of the Nazi Party in Germany. The [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] paramilitary organization the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA) wore brown uniforms and were known as the [[Sturmabteilung|brownshirts]]. The color brown was used to represent the Nazi vote on maps of electoral districts in Germany. If someone voted for the Nazis, they were said to be "voting brown". The national headquarters of the Nazi party, in [[Munich]], was called the ''[[Brown House, Munich, Germany|Brown House]]''. The Nazi seizure of power in 1933 was called the ''[[Machtergreifung|Brown Revolution]]''.<ref>Toland, John ''Hitler: The Pictorial Documentary of his Life'' Garden City, New York:1978 Doubleday & Sons Chapter 5 "The Brown Revolution" Pages 42–60</ref> At [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Obersalzberg]] home, the [[Berghof (Hitler)|Berghof]], he slept in a "bed which was usually covered by a brown quilt embroidered with a huge [[swastika]].

The swastika also appeared on Hitler's brown satin pajamas, embroidered in black against a red background on the pocket. He had a matching brown silk robe."<ref>Infield, Glenn B. ''Eva and Adolf'' New York:1974--Grosset and Dunlap Page 142 (The author compiled this book by interviewing [[Albert Speer]] and others who had been in Hitler's inner circle, such as [[SS]] men, secretaries, and housekeepers. The author also consulted the Musmanno Archives, a record of post-war interviews with over 200 people who had been close to Adolf Hitler or Eva Braun.)</ref> Brown had originally been chosen as a Party color largely for convenience; large numbers of war-surplus brown uniforms from Germany's former colonial forces in Africa were cheaply available in the 1920s. It also suited the working-class and military images that the Party wished to convey.

From the 1930s onwards, the Party's brown uniforms were mass-produced by German clothing firms such as [[Hugo Boss]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/15/business/hugo-boss-acknowledges-link-to-nazi-regime.html?src=pm|title=Hugo Boss Acknowledges Link to Nazi Regime |date=August 14, 1997|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=September 29, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=White|first=Constance C.

UPS has filed two [[trademark]]s on the color brown to prevent other shipping companies (and possibly other companies in general) from using the color if it creates "market confusion". In its advertising, UPS refers to itself as "Brown" ("What can Brown do for you?"). Labrecque, et al. (2012) have hypothesized that brown would be related to competence when used in [[advertising]], as the color is typically associated with reoiability and support However, they did not find a link between brown and competence.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Labrecque | first1 = Lauren I. | last2 = Milne | first2 = George R. | year = 2012 | title = Exciting Red and Competent Blue: The Importance of Color in Marketing | journal = Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science | volume = 40 | issue = 5| pages = 714 | doi=10.1007/s11747-010-0245-y| s2cid = 167731928 |quote=(Murray and Deabler 1957; Schaie 1961; Wexner 1954).
