'''Caitlin''' ({{IPA-ga|ˈkatʲlʲiːnʲ}}) is a feminine given name of [[Irish language|Irish]] origin. Historically, the Irish name '''Caitlín''' was anglicized as [[Cathleen]] or [[Kathleen (given name)|Kathleen]]. In the 1970s, however, non-Irish speakers began pronouncing the name according to English spelling rules as {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|eɪ|t|l|ɪ|n}} {{respell|KAYT|lin}}, which led to many variations in spelling such as '''Caitlin''', '''Ceitlin''', '''Catelynn''', '''Caitlyn''', '''Katlyn''', '''Kaitlin''', '''Kaitlyn''', '''Katelyn''' and '''Katelynn'''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.babynames.com/name/CAITLIN| title=Caitlin - Origin and Meaning of the name Caitlin at BabyNames.com|access-date=March 4, 2008}}</ref><ref name="namenerds_katelyn">{{Cite web| url=http://www.namenerds.com/irish/Katelyn.html| title=Irish Names: You say Caitlyn, I say Kaytlynne... |access-date=March 4, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.babynamescountry.com/meanings/Caitlin.html|title=Origin and Meaning of Caitlin - Baby Girl Name Caitlin|access-date=March 4, 2008}}</ref>

It is the Irish version of the [[Old French]] name ''Cateline'' {{IPA|fr|katlin|}}, which comes from [[Catherine]], which in turn comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] Αἰκατερίνη (Aikaterine). Catherine is attributed to [[St. Catherine of Alexandria]].<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.behindthename.com/name/katherine |title = Behind the Name: Meaning, Origin and History of the Name Katherine |access-date = February 6, 2008}}</ref> Along with the many other variants of Catherine, it is generally believed to mean "pure" because of its long association with the Greek adjective καθαρός ''katharos'' (pure), though the name did not evolve from this word.<ref>{{cite book|editor=Hanks, Patrick |editor2=Hodges, Flavia |title=A Dictionary of First Names|location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006}}</ref>
